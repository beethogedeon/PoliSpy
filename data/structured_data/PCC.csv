Poilievre promises he'll be 'respectful and firm' against Trump; Tory Kickoff Federal Election 2025,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre launched his campaign Sunday promising to deliver change, and contrasting himself to the man his Liberal opponents are expected to try and paint him as over the next 36 days: U.S. President Donald Trump. Appearing at the Museum of History across the river from Parliament Hill, Poilievre said he shares the anger and anxiety Canadians are feeling because of Trump's words and the current trade war Canada finds itself in with its closest ally. ""I respect the office of the President of the United States and we have to show respect to other world leaders,"" Poilievre said, when asked whether he respects Trump. He said given the two countries' trading relationship and that Trump will be in office for the next four years, Canada's next prime minster will have to work with him. ""You can be respectful and firm, and I believe we have to be both. I will insist the president recognize the independence and sovereignty of Canada. I will insist that he stop tariffing our nation."" ""At the same time,"" Poilievre said, ""I will strengthen our country so that we can be capable of standing (on) our own two feet and standing up to the Americans, where and when necessary. That's what it means when I say let's put Canada first for a change."" Liberal Leader Mark Carney wasted no time arguing that Poilievre was stealing his policy ideas from Trump's administration. ""That's the choice for Canadians: a Canadian Trump or a government that unites the country and focuses on action in order to build a strong economy that works for all Canadians,"" said Carney, in French, at a news conference outside Rideau Hall on Sunday. Poilievre launched his campaign as public opinion polls show his two-and-a- half-year 20-point lead over the Liberals collapsing into a dead heat between the two parties, with concerns about the cost-of-living taking a back seat to Trump's tariffs and his comments about annexing Canada. The Conservative leader, who has spent the preceding months championing affordability issues, is now trying to thread the needle between voters' fears about threats coming from the U.S., and the economic situation Canada finds itself in. Asked about Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's comments made to the far-right outlet Breitbart, where she said Trump's trade war was helping the Liberals politically and that her message to administration officials was that Poilievre would be more aligned with its direction, Poilievre sidestepped her comments, instead referring to an interview Trump gave where the president said it would be easier to work with a Liberal in power. Trump is nonetheless expected to loom large over the campaign and, next week, the president's deadline for new tariffs on Canada will arrive. Poilievre spoke on Sunday about half an hour before Carney was scheduled to ask Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament and send Canadians to the polls next month. ""I will protect this country and put Canada first,"" said Poilievre, in a speech that excoriated the Liberal government's record of a ""lost decade."" Poilievre also used the speech to introduce himself to Canadians, explaining that he ""was born to a 16-year-old single mother who put me up for adoption to two school teachers."" Those ""humble beginnings"" gave him a sense of why Canada is special, said Poilievre. He appeared alongside his wife, Ana, along with their two children, Valentina and Cruz. He smiled and waved with his family, afterwards introducing his son to reporters as well as his stuffed toy penguin, whom Poilievre confirmed was named Penguin.

Boisterous crowd turns out for Poilievre rally in Sudbury,2025.0,"As was the case when Pierre Poilievre last packed a room in the Radisson Hotel, in the summer of 2023, there was no shortage of enthusiasm among supporters who turned out for his Canada First rally on Wednesday evening. They were regularly on their feet, and applauding wildly, particularly when the Conservative leader spoke about ending ""catch-and-release"" bail rules and ensuring more of their hard-earned money stays in their pockets. This time, though, there might also have been a touch of nervous energy, given an election is all but certain this spring and the Conservatives have lately experienced a significant drop in the polls. That wasn't addressed directly, but you could feel it in the way Poilievre went after his newly tapped rival, new Liberal leader and prime minister Mark Carney, whom he accused of being in a ""conflict of interest"" due to his ""millions of dollars of stock options and other hidden investments."" Also this time, with an election nigh, a small but passionate group of activists were on hand to protest Poilievre's appearance. They stood outside the Radisson on Mackenzie Street, waving signs with such slogans as ""Social Workers Against Poilievre"" and ""No Security Clearance, What Are You Hiding?"" The other difference was an appearance by his wife, Anaida, who in some ways stole the show in introducing the would-be prime minister. She spoke touchingly about her family's journey from Venezuela to Canada when she was a child, and how her father worked multiple jobs, including picking fruit and vegetables, to keep them housed and fed. She also stressed how committed her husband has been to his job, travelling from coast to coast to connect with Canadians and speak up for their concerns. ""Hard work is really ingrained in us, and the Canadian promise is what we truly believe, because without that we would not be here today,"" she said. The crowd also heard from Sudbury candidate Ian Symington, who took the floor after a song by Martha and The Muffins had played through the speakers. Its chorus - ""Echo Beach, far away in time"" - seemed to flow quite well into the theme of his speech. ""The last time we elected a Conservative in Sudbury was 1921,"" he said. ""That's 104 years. But I'm going to tell you, we have enough votes in Sudbury to win the election - and that's a result of our hardworking volunteers."" A lot of what Poilievre said Wednesday was familiar from ear- lier speeches: he still plans to axe the tax (the Liberals, he pointed out, have only removed the carbon price from consumers, not industry); expedite approvals for mining projects and pipelines; and slash the federal bureaucracy, which he described as ""morbidly obese."" He also recycled a quip from his last appearance in Sudbury, in relation to the temperature needed to liquefy gas: ""It got so cold in Ottawa this winter, Justin Trudeau was seen with his hands in his own pockets."" The line still drew a huge laugh, however, much as crowd-pleasing numbers don't get old to many music fans. Poilievre did, however, address some recent remarks from U.S. president Donald Trump, who told Fox News on Tuesday that he would ""rather deal with a Liberal than a Conservative."" Trump also described Poilievre as ""stupidly no friend of mine."" The Tory leader said it's no surprise that the U.S. president would rather deal with Carney, as ""he knows the Liberals have made Canada's economy weaker. He knows they have driven a half-trillion dollars of investment south."" Poilievre also drew a comparison between Trump and Carney, stating that ""both of them want to tax Canadian industry - Carney's carbon tax and Trump's tariffs target the same businesses, the same workers, and ultimately the same consumers. I'm against both the tariffs and the taxes."" The best way to move the country ahead, in the face of trade threats and outright barriers, is to make the most out of what we already have, he argued. ""We could be absolutely self-reliant,"" said Poilievre. ""We have the longest oceanic coast in the world, the second-biggest landmass, the third-biggest supply of oil. We're the fifth-biggest supplier of natural gas, we have the biggest supply of freshwater, we have the fourth-biggest supply of farmland per capita of any country on planet earth, the most uranium for nuclear and potash for farming. We have it all, and best of all, we have the smartest, best workers anywhere on earth."" jmoodie@postmedia.com","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.","Moodie, Jim",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 22, 2025",Canada-US relations; Prime ministers; Tariffs,,2025-03-22,Sudbury Star
"Poilievre can't 'bulldoze' his way in getting Ring of Fire developed, critics say; Federal government must consult with First Nations and address environmental concerns, they s ay",2025.0,"Critics say Pierre Poilievre can't ignore the federal government's obligation to consult with First Nations in any effort to fast-track the development of the Ring of Fire in Northern Ontario. While in Sudbury on Wednesday, the Conservative leader said he'll ""set a deadline"" to approve all federal permits for mining in northwestern Ontario's Ring of Fire region within six months. Poilievre said that because the Ring of Fire holds large deposits of critical minerals considered important to national security, Canada could claim some of the infrastructure spending in the region toward its NATO commitment to spend at least two per cent of national GDP on defence. The Ring of Fire is about 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay and contains massive deposits of critical minerals like nickel, copper, platinum and cobalt that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. These minerals have dozens of applications in things like electric vehicles, cellphones, medical devices and solar panels. Poilievre said that a Conservative government would also commit $1 billion over three years to build a road network to link the mining sites to Ontario's highway network and First Nations communities in the area. ""We will make this money available by cutting foreign aid, bureaucracy, consultants, and other Liberal waste to free up money for productive investments,"" he said. However, Energy and Natural Resource Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said nothing will get built in this country without consultation with Indigenous people - a legal requirement for development on First Nations land. ""The Ring of Fire is an interesting deposit ... but you have to be thoughtful about engaging Indigenous people and there is an assessment process underway now,"" Wilkinson said before Wednesday's cabinet meeting in Ottawa. Terms of reference to guide federal assessments of future developments in the Ring of Fire were finalized between 15 First Nations and the federal Impact Assessment Agency in January. Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of Nishnawbe Aski Nations, which includes the 15 First Nations in the Ring of Fire, said that the timeline Poilievre proposed is ""unacceptable"" and ""reckless"" and warns it would ignore treaty commitments to consultation. ""Our people are not necessarily opposed to any developments on their lands. What they want is ... a meaningful role in terms of how that development happens,"" Fiddler said. Fiddler added First Nations communities are entitled to know how a development could affect current and future generations. Ontario Regional Chief Abram Benedict said that no matter what happens, the federal government can't ignore its legal obligation to consult with First Nations. ""It's entrenched in law that there has to be consultation with First Nations people and that's not something that can be vetoed in six months,"" he said. ""We expect the federal government to uphold their responsibility of that consultation, regardless of what announcements have been made."" Some First Nations, though, welcomed Poilievre's announcement. In a joint statement, Chief Cornelius Wabasse of Webequie First Nation and Chief Bruce Achneepineskum of Marten Falls First Nation said Poilievre's plan aligns with ""long-standing efforts"" to build roads and they see it as a step toward economic reconciliation. Poilievre said his government would allow companies involved in Ring of Fire extraction projects to pay a portion of their federal taxes directly to First Nations communities in the area. Ontario Premier Doug Ford promised to speed up provincial approvals for Ring of Fire projects during the recent provincial election. Ford said he sees the Ring of Fire as essential to developing an end-to-end electric vehicle supply chain in the province. The Ontario government only considers nine First Nations to be within the Ring of Fire region. It also says there are more than 26,000 mining claims for the Ring of Fire held by 15 companies and individuals. Sol Mamakwa, Ontario NDP deputy leader and MPP for Kiiwetinoong, has criticized the provincial government's consultation efforts. He said First Nations can't be kept out of discussions about federal timelines. ""It needs to be done in a way where weareatthetable,notonthemenu,"" Mamakwa said. ""And I think it's important that we follow the process of free, prior, informed consent, and that's all they want. And we need to be a part of the discussion and not just an afterthought."" Mamakwa said he does not think it's possible to complete the necessary consultations in six months. Nadia Verrelli, federal NDP candidate for Sudbury, said in a release that her party would work with First Nations communities to get consent to develop the Ring of Fire and build the necessary roads. ""Poilievre wants to bulldoze right through rights holders, only delaying development, rather than do what's obligated to move the project forward,"" Verrelli said. ""Northern Ontarians just can't trust Conservatives to get this project done because they refuse to do it right,"" she said. ""An NDP government would work with First Nations to sell our critical minerals to the world and ensure sustainability and Indigenous rights are at the heart of our strategy."" The Sudbury area's Liberal MPs also pushed back against Poilievre's claims the federal government has failed to push the Ring of Fire forward. ""When people outside our region come and tell us how they'll 'fix' the Ring of Fire, it only serves to show how little they know about mining and Northern Ontario,"" Sudbury Liberal MP Viviane Lapointe said. ""Everyone knows the Ring of Fire is a critical strategic investment for Canada, but you can't simply decree that it's getting done when you say so. ""Pierre Poilievre lost all credibility to talk about the Ring of Fire or any mining project when he voted against the Critical Minerals Strategy, a key piece of legislation to ramp up new mining in Canada and deliver the jobs that come with it. Poilievre also voted against $4 billion for critical minerals in our country. You can't build roads without investing in infrastructure and workers."" Nickel Belt MP Marc Serre said that ""governments need to take a responsible, collaborative approach - one that respects Indigenous communities and safeguards our environment. This stands in stark contrast to the previous Conservative government under Stephen Harper, which faced over 150 court challenges due to its failure to engage meaningfully with Indigenous partners and environmental concerns. ""The Ring of Fire isn't just about resource development - it's about people and the land,"" Serre said. ""Responsible leadership means listening to Indigenous voices, enforcing environmental protections, and ensuring governments, industry, and Indigenous communities work together. ""It cannot be a one-man show, as Pierre Poilievre would have it. Leadership is about collaboration, not division. That's how we build sustainable, inclusive development that benefits Northern Ontario while preserving our natural resources for future generations."" sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca Bluesky: @sudburystar.bsky.social X: @SudburyStar Star Staff/Canadian Press","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 22, 2025",Federal government; Leadership; Collaboration; Native rights; Consultants; Critical minerals; Electric vehicles; Native North Americans,,2025-03-22,Sudbury Star
"Poilievre, Ford deny report on call for help; 'Not accurate'",2025.0,"O T TAWA . Both Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford are denying a report suggesting the federal leader asked the premier for help on the forthcoming election campaign, but was rebuffed. ""The report is not accurate,"" Poilievre told reporters during a news conference at a union local in suburban Ottawa Friday morning. In French, he added that he had an ""excellent"" conversation with Ford. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers when they want to talk, and we talked about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production, and reversing the lost Liberal decade,"" he added, reprising many of his recent policy announcements. A Toronto Star report on Thursday cited unnamed sources who said the Conservative leader called Ford on Monday and asked him for advice on the approaching federal election. According to the Star, Ford declined to provide any guidance and told Poilievre he was focused on leading Ontario and would stay out of the federal race. The Star story said there has been no love lost between the two camps for years, with many in Poilievre's entourage saying Ford's Progressive Conservatives don't govern enough from the right. Later on Friday in Toronto, Ford went even further than Poilievre, and said the federal leader did not ask him for advice and the Star story was wrong. ""It was the first time I ever spoke to him. I guess what was reported was not accurate at all,"" Ford said. ""He didn't ask me for help ... so I don't know where they came up with that story."" Both leaders dodged questions about the revelations that the tone of the call was ""stilted and awkward,"" and that Ford's entourage was annoyed Poilievre did not congratulate the premier for his election win on Feb. 27. ""I want to see how each leader is going to protect Ontario. Are they going to get the Ring of Fire moving forward. Are they going to get out of the way and make sure we get into the critical minerals?"" Ford told reporters. ""Times have changed now. We're in an economic war with the largest country in the world and we have to get to those critical minerals as quickly as possible,"" he added. During his Friday news conference, Poilievre announced a Conservative government would maintain a $4,000 apprenticeship grant that helps apprentices cover the cost of training in their trade. He also promised funding for union training halls to help cover the cost of equipment and programs. A third promise was to create a ""special rapid class"" of employment insurance that would accelerate applications for tradespeople who step away from their work for additional training. ""Right now, they have to wait weeks on end without any money coming in as they're training up, and that puts them in a tough spot paying the rent,"" Poilievre said. The Conservative leader also took a swipe at Prime Minister Mark Carney, accusing him of being a ""union buster "" because of the actions of certain divisions of Brookfield Asset Management while he chaired the company's board of directors. ""Mark Carney will never stand up for the working people. He will only stand up for the millionaire and billionaire global elites. That is all he has ever done,"" Poilievre charged. The prime minister has not yet responded to Poilievre's ""union buster"" insult, but was expected to address the media after he meets with the premiers Friday night in Ottawa. Carney is expected to visit Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Sunday to request that she dissolve Parliament so he can launch a snap federal election.

"Poilievre, Ford deny report on call for help; 'Not accurate'",2025.0,". Both Conserva- tive Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford are denying a report suggesting the federal leader asked the premier for help on the forthcoming election campaign, but was rebuffed. ""The report is not accurate,"" Poilievre told reporters during a news conference at a union local in suburban Ottawa Friday morning. In French, he added that he had an ""excellent"" conversation with Ford. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers when they want to talk, and we talked about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production, and reversing the lost Liberal decade,"" he added, reprising many of his recent policy announcements. A Toronto Star report on Thursday cited unnamed sources who said the Conservative leader called Ford on Monday and asked him for advice on the approaching federal election. According to the Star, Ford declined to provide any guidance and told Poilievre he was focused on leading Ontario and would stay out of the federal race. The Star story said there has been no love lost between the two camps for years, with many in Poilievre's entourage saying Ford's Progressive Conservatives don't govern enough from the right. Later on Friday in Toronto, Ford went even further than Poilievre, and said the federal leader did not ask him for advice and the Star story was wrong. ""It was the first time I ever spoke to him. I guess what was reported was not accurate at all,"" Ford said. ""He didn't ask me for help ... so I don't know where they came up with that story."" Both leaders dodged questions about the revelations that the tone of the call was ""stilted and awkward,"" and that Ford's entourage was annoyed Poilievre did not congratulate the premier for his election win on Feb. 27. ""I want to see how each leader is going to protect Ontario. Are they going to get the Ring of Fire moving forward. Are they going to get out of the way and make sure we get into the critical minerals?"" Ford told reporters. ""Times have changed now. We're in an economic war with the largest country in the world and we have to get to those critical minerals as quickly as possible,"" he added. During his Friday news conference, Poilievre announced a Conservative government would maintain a $4,000 apprenticeship grant that helps apprentices cover the cost of training in their trade. He also promised funding for union training halls to help cover the cost of equipment and programs. A third promise was to create a ""special rapid class"" of employment insurance that would accelerate applications for tradespeople who step away from their work for additional training. ""Right now, they have to wait weeks on end without any money coming in as they're training up, and that puts them in a tough spot paying the rent,"" Poilievre said. The Conservative leader also took a swipe at Prime Minister Mark Carney, accusing him of being a ""union buster "" because of the actions of certain divisions of Brookfield Asset Management while he chaired the company's board of directors. ""Mark Carney will never stand up for the working people. He will only stand up for the millionaire and billionaire global elites. That is all he has ever done,"" Poilievre charged. The prime minister has not yet responded to Poilievre's ""union buster"" insult, but was expected to address the media after he meets with the premiers Friday night in Ottawa. Carney is expected to visit Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Sunday to request that she dissolve Parliament so he can launch a snap federal election.

"Tories confront a new reality; Anxiety on the rise as trade spat, Trudeau exit Capsize Poilievre's Election plan",2025.0,"OTTAWA . Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump upended Canada's trade relationship with its closest neighbour, but also the affordability fight Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants to have in the next election. Soaring Conservative confidence has now been tempered by former prime minister Justin Trudeau's resignation and the upheaval south of the border, two events that have collapsed Poilievre's 20-point lead in the polls, with some surveys now suggesting he is trailing Prime Minister Mark Carney. In the lead-up to Sunday's election call, anxiety and confusion has set in among some Conservatives, including within Poilievre's office, over how the leader is navigating the current moment and what an election campaign overshadowed by an unpredictable U.S. president may bring. How much that post-Trudeau reality has sunk in - and will stick - for Poilievre remains an open question, given his long-held confidence that he can drive his own message and the brand he has built for himself as having unchanged views in politics after 20 years.

"Tories confront a new reality; Anxiety on the rise as trade spat, Trudeau exit capsize Poilievre's election plan",2025.0,"OTTAWA . Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump upended Canada's trade relationship with its closest neighbour, but also the affordability fight Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants to have in the next election. Soaring Conservative confidence has now been tempered by former prime minister Justin Trudeau's resignation and the upheaval south of the border, two events that have collapsed Poilievre's 20-point lead in the polls, with some surveys now suggesting he is trailing Prime Minister Mark Carney. In the lead-up to Sunday's election call, anxiety and confusion has set in among some Conservatives, including within Poilievre's office, over how the leader is navigating the current moment and what an election campaign overshadowed by an unpredictable U.S. president may bring. How much that post-Trudeau reality has sunk in - and will stick for Poilievre remains an open question, given his long-held confidence that he can drive his own message and the brand he has built for himself as having unchanged views in politics after 20 years. ""I believe that the biggest challenge for Mr. Poilievre is focusing on all those things that he is going to do and focusing less on Mark Carney,"" said Dimitri Soudas, a former director of communications for Stephen Harper, the country's most recent Conservative prime minister. ""This is a change election. So truly, all you need to do is lay out your change agenda and all you need to say is, 'You know, these guys have had 10 years.' "" To understand where the party finds itself and what it must do to win, National Post spoke with more than a dozen Conservatives, including strategists, party activists, MPs and veteran campaigners. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly about the situation. For the past two months, there have been internal debates around the merits of Poilievre sticking with his call for a ""carbon tax election"" and pushing his ""axe the tax"" message, which some Conservatives say has staying power as a larger rallying cry for cost-of-living issues. Last month, Poilievre debuted his response to Canadians worried about the cross-border relationship at a packed ""Canada First"" rally in downtown Ottawa. He delivered a speech linking the economic situation the country finds itself in back to the past nine years of Liberal rule. He has kept hammering that point since, while at the same time not abandoning the slogans and pocketbook issues Conservatives have successfully championed, including the carbon tax, which he revisited earlier in the week, even after Carney announced he was reducing the consumer tax rate to zero, beginning April 1. Poilievre's announcement that he would scrap the industrial carbon tax came after his office had in fact been considering keeping it. The Conservative leader himself had offered support for Alberta's model in past speeches in the House of Commons. The politics of the moment, however, changed the calculation. Should gas prices fall by 18 cents a litre as estimated once Carney's change takes effect in April, the push to ""axe the tax"" will lose its -ef fectiveness, some sources say. ""It just seems like they're very unsure of themselves,"" one party insider said. ""There's no narrative."" All of this has led to some members of his entourage recently making it clear to Poilievre: He is no longer in the lead. That, one senior Conservative source suggested, has pushed the 45-year-old leader to reach out to people outside his tight circle of usual confidants to seek advice on how to best take on Carney. Poilievre has sought input on his campaign pitch from multiple caucus members, former advisers and even Ontario Premier Doug Ford, which resulted in a media report that Ford had rebuffed Poilievre but that both men disputed on Friday. Poilievre has also been working the phone with candidates who have been out door-knocking and helping produce videos the party plans to release with each new policy promise. In public, Poilievre has adopted a less biting tone and ratcheted down his attacks against Carney, who the party has running been running ads against, painting him as ""sneaky."" Campaign material sent to candidates still features familiar attacks against the new Liberal leader, branding the party the ""Carney-Trudeau Liberals,"" saying they are responsible for ""out-ofcontrol immigration"" and support for ""job-killing carbon taxes."" Poilievre's main tag line for the campaign remains ""bring it home,"" with the material featuring other wellknown slogans of ""stop the crime"" and ""fix the budget."" Overshadowing the Conservatives' point that the Liberals are responsible for the economic vulnerability Canada faces and the price of food and housing remaining too high, especially for those under 40, is that, in the shadow of Trump, voters may choose to stick with what they know and deliver the Liberals a fourth mandate - a rarity in Canadian politics. ""In times of crisis, people like incumbencies,"" said Scott Lamb, who served as the Conservative party's president from 2016 to 2021, comparing the situation to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is noise in the system because people will be distracted, ultimately, from the things that they're unhappy with for only so long."" Getting Canadians to focus on the Liberal record instead will be Poilievre's task for the campaign. Election day could either be April 28 or May 5, with it widely anticipated that the Liberals will opt for the shortest legally allowed time frame to take advantage of the party's surge in the polls. In advance of that, Poilievre has begun pitching himself as the agent for change by calling the preceding years ""the lost Liberal decade."" Nova Scotia Sen. Michael MacDonald suggest Liberals prefer to run against Trump, which is serving as a distraction. He also dismissed Trump's comments on annexing Canada as simply ""rhetoric."" ""The election's about the economy, it's not about Donald Trump,"" he told National Post. ""Donald Trump's not running Canada,"" he said. ""Donald Trump didn't run Canada into the ground."" Heading into the campaign, the Liberal party released new ads pitching Carney, a former central banker, as having the economic experience to stand up against Trump's tariffs, countering Poilievre's ""Canada First"" message with Carney's pledge to keep ""Canada Strong."" Behind-the-scenes, the Conservatives, who have long called for an election, have been busy staffing up a war room, with exact jobs yet to be defined, and dispatching Parliament Hill staffers to act as campaign mangers for candidates. In battleground ridings, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, which is key to win for forming government, the focus is also on the plummeting support for the NDP, as its supporters look to the Carney-led Liberals. A two-way race between the Tories and Liberals could spell trouble for the Conservatives, which have historically depended on New Democrats splitting the leftof-centre vote for victory. Jenni Byrne, Poilievre's top adviser, and the Conservatives' national campaign director, notified media this week that reporters would not be permitted to travel with Poilievre on the campaign, breaking with long-standing tradition of how media outlets provide federal election coverage for Canadians. (They pay their own way.) As Poilievre prepares to hit the hustings, a complaint mentioned on the doorsteps and in calls MPs have been making to voters has been around his tone, especially for older voters, wary of Trump. He has also received feedback that he is not talking enough about the U.S. president. When confronted with concerns about Poilievre and Trump, one candidate said they point to how Trump himself has said Poilievre is not a ""MAGA guy"" and suggests that his style may be exactly what is needed to go toe-to-toe with Trump.

Stamp pays tribute to ex-PM Mulroney; Family says 'favourite picture' chosen for honour,2025.0,"Canada Post unveiled a new stamp on Thursday in tribute to Brian Mulroney, Canada's 18th prime minister. The release continues Canada Post's long-standing tradition of commemorating former Canadian prime ministers. Born in Baie-Comeau, on Quebec's lower north shore, Mulroney served as prime minister from 1984 to 1993. He died on Feb. 29, 2024, at the age of 84. The stamp features a photograph of Mulroney smiling and it was designed by the Montreal-based firm Paprika. Canada Post said it has issued 120,000 booklets, each containing 10 permanent stamps, along with 7,000 official first-day covers. Thursday's unveiling ceremony took place at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and featured an intimate gathering of family and close friends invited by the Mulroney family. Attendees heard remarks from Canada Post executives and Mulroney's son, Ben. ""It's his birthday today, so to be able to spend the day with my family and celebrate Dad this way is fitting and wonderful,"" Ben told The Gazette after the unveiling. When choosing the image of Mulroney for the stamp, he explained that the family had gone ""back and forth on a number of pictures,"" but the one chosen ""was the one we kept coming back to."" ""It's the cover of his memoir, and it's our favourite picture of him be-cause it was a time in his life when he was optimistic and purely happy,"" he said. Asked what his father would make of today's political climate, Ben responded: ""I'm reticent to speak for him, but there's a lot of hyperbole out there. I remember asking him about it during Trump 1.0, when people were saying Don-ald Trump was going to destroy America and democracy. He told me: 'I'm far more bullish on the American republic than on any one person's attempts to destroy it.' ""And so I think he would say today: 'I'm far more bullish on Canada than on any one person's attempt to annex it.'""","Montreal Gazette; Montreal, Que.","Montreal, Que.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 22, 2025",Prime ministers,,2025-03-22,Montreal Gazette
"Poilievre, Ford deny report on call for help; 'Not accurate'",2025.0,"Both Conserva-tive Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford are denying a report suggesting the federal leader asked the premier for help on the forthcoming election campaign, but was rebuffed. ""The report is not accurate,"" Poilievre told reporters during a news conference at a union local in suburban Ottawa Friday morning. In French, he added that he had an ""excellent"" conversation with Ford. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers when they want to talk, and we talked about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production, and reversing the lost Liberal decade,"" he added, reprising many of his recent policy announcements. A Toronto Star report on Thursday cited unnamed sources who said the Conservative leader called Ford on Monday and asked him for advice on the approaching federal election. According to the Star, Ford declined to provide any guidance and told Poilievre he was focused on leading Ontario and would stay out of the federal race. The Star story said there has been no love lost between the two camps for years, with many in Poilievre's entourage saying Ford's Progressive Conservatives don't govern enough from the right. Later on Friday in Toronto, Ford went even further than Poilievre, and said the federal leader did not ask him for advice and the Star story was wrong. ""It was the first time I ever spoke to him. I guess what was reported was not accurate at all,"" Ford said. ""He didn't ask me for help ... so I don't know where they came up with that story."" Both leaders dodged questions about the revelations that the tone of the call was ""stilted and awkward,"" and that Ford's entourage was annoyed Poilievre did not congratulate the premier for his election win on Feb. 27. ""I want to see how each leader is going to protect Ontario. Are they going to get the Ring of Fire moving forward. Are they going to get out of the way and make sure we get into the critical minerals?"" Ford told reporters. ""Times have changed now. We're in an economic war with the largest country in the world and we have to get to those critical minerals as quickly as possible,"" he added. During his Friday news conference, Poilievre announced a Conservative government would maintain a $4,000 apprenticeship grant that helps apprentices cover the cost of training in their trade. He also promised funding for union training halls to help cover the cost of equipment and programs. A third promise was to create a ""special rapid class"" of employment insurance that would accelerate applications for tradespeople who step away from their work for additional training. ""Right now, they have to wait weeks on end without any money coming in as they're training up, and that puts them in a tough spot paying the rent,"" Poilievre said. The Conservative leader also took a swipe at Prime Minister Mark Carney, accusing him of being a ""union buster "" because of the actions of certain divisions of Brookfield Asset Management while he chaired the company's board of directors. ""Mark Carney will never stand up for the working people. He will only stand up for the millionaire and billionaire global elites. That is all he has ever done,"" Poilievre charged. The prime minister has not yet responded to Poilievre's ""union buster"" insult, but was expected to address the media after he meets with the premiers Friday night in Ottawa. Carney is expected to visit Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Sunday to request that she dissolve Parliament so he can launch a snap federal election.

Behind-the-scenes, the Conservatives, who have long called for an election, have been busy staffing up a war room, with exact jobs yet to be defined, and dispatching Parliament Hill staffers to act as campaign mangers for candidates. In battleground ridings, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, which is key to win for forming government, the focus is also on the plummeting support for the NDP, as its supporters look to the Carney-led Liberals. A two-way race between the Tories and Liberals could spell trouble for the Conservatives, which have historically depended on New Democrats splitting the leftof-centre vote for victory. Jenni Bryne, Poilievre's top adviser, and the Conservatives' national campaign director, notified media this week that reporters would not be permitted to travel with Poilievre on the campaign, breaking with long-standing tradition of how media outlets provide federal election coverage for Canadians. (They pay their own way.) As Poilievre prepares to hit the hustings, a complaint mentioned on the doorsteps and in calls MPs have been making to voters has been around his tone, especially for older voters, wary of Trump. He has also received feedback that he is not talking enough about the U.S. president. When confronted with concerns about Poilievre and Trump, one candidate said they point to how Trump himself has said Poilievre is not a ""MAGA guy"" and suggests that his style may be exactly what is needed to go toe-to-toe with Trump. It is the explanation Poilievre himself has given to voters, at least to those in Quebec through a new ad where he admits his style is seen as ""too direct"" and ""too blunt."" The Conservatives were quick to embrace Trump's most recent comments that he would rather have a Liberal in office than Poilievre. Speaking at an event on Friday, Poilievre also made it clear what he sees as the question Canadians will answer in the coming election. ""Do we want a fourth term of Liberals who block resources, tax our people, drive up our costs, unleash crime in our community and make us weak and defenceless facing the Americans, or do we want put Canada first for a change?"" Poilievre will soon find out.

Mulroney's irish eyes smiling on new canada post stamp; Montreal,2025.0,"Canada Post has unveiled a new stamp in tribute to Brian Mulroney, Canada's 18th prime minister. The release on Thursday continues Canada Post's long-standing tradition of commemorating former Canadian prime ministers. Mulroney served as prime minister from 1984 to 1993. He died on Feb. 29, 2024, at the age of 84. The stamp features a photograph of Mulroney smiling and it was designed by the Montreal-based firm Paprika. Canada Post said it has issued 120,000 booklets, each containing 10 permanent stamps, along with 7,000 official firstday covers. Thursday's unveiling ceremony took place at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The image his family chose for the stamp is ""our favourite picture of him because it was a time in his life when he was optimistic and purely happy,"" Mulroney's son Ben said.

Poilievre must make a pivot; Leave behind the politics of humiliation,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre often stresses that the Liberals are seeking a fourth consecutive term, implying that four is simply too many. It certainly is for Conservatives, who have never won four in a row since Sir John A. Macdonald, who won four consecutive majorities (and six of the first seven Canadian federal elections). For the Liberals, contrariwise, four is, as in golf, par for the course. Sir Wilfrid Laurier won four consecutive majorities himself. His successor as Liberal leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King, won three consecutive minorities in the 1920s, and then three more elections in 1935, 1940 and 1945. Together with his successor, Louis St. Laurent (majorities in 1949 and 1953), they won five straight. After the John Diefenbaker interlude, Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau won another five straight elections (and six out of seven) from 1963 to 1980. Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin then won another four straight elections from 1993 to 2004. If Prime Minister Mark Carney were to win a fourth after Justin Trudeau's three, it would fit a 125-year pattern. A fourth Liberal mandate would be wholly unremarkable in Canadian history. What is remarkable is that the day before yesterday Poilievre was cruising along, confident - perhaps even complacent - of a thumping majority. Then cometh Trump and goeth Trudeau, presenting the possibility that cometh Carney may mean goeth Poilievre. After leading by wide polling margins for two years, Poilievre still has the advantage. The voters' settled judgment in his favour is being reconsidered now, but reconsideration is not followed inevit- ably by reversal. Reconsideration may lead to reconfirmation. That happened in 1984 and 1993. Aside from his Ottawa relaunch rally - at which Poilievre not o -n ly wrapped himself in the flag but even put on a suit - the opposition leader has not been campaigning vigorously; all the attention has been on U.S. President Donald Trump, Premier Doug Ford and now Carney. Perhaps Poilievre is preparing to follow the pattern of Stephen Harper's first victorious campaign, when he unveiled a new policy each day for 30 days straight. There is much yet for Canadians to see and judge. Yet one thing will have to change. Poilievre will have to leave behind the politics of humiliation. It is a key part of Trump's appeal; he delights in humiliating others. His tribe delights in watching him do so. And it is a source of his power. He humiliates his allies. If they refuse to accept it, Trump turns on them. But if they compound their humiliation with self-abasement, Trump rewards them. Canada is now the target of Trumpian humiliation. Canadians have not chosen self-abasement. Carney demonstrates in his (historically) astonishing decision to have no direct contact with the American president in the first weeks of his premiership. He says that he will speak with Trump when the ""disrespect"" stops. He does not offer pre-emptive obeisance. For the moment Carney's distance from Trump, who is massively unpopular with Canadian voters, poses something of a challenge for Poilievre. There is no indication that Poilievre would abase himself before Trump, and Carney was wrong to claim as much in his victory speech. Nevertheless, as Canadians reject the politics of humiliation, Poilievre has a problem. He has practised it. Despite more than two years as Conservative leader, making his agenda clear, including some significant policy proposals, a critical first, and lasting, impression for many was his apple-chomping interview in British Columbia. He was not going into battle with the titans of Canadian journalism; he was talking to the local, leftist editor of a community newspaper printed in Osoyoos. He humiliated him; the apple-chomping emphasized that he was not even worth interrupting a snack. It was rude and a bit cruel. It was also massively popular. Many people like that sort of thing. There are many foreigners who know nothing else about Poilievre - and love him for it. It was not a one-off. While Poilievre is endlessly gracious with those who come to his rallies, his dealings with the media are often dismissive, offering a snarl instead of a smile. The politics of humiliation can be darkly fascinating, even appealing in a mildly sinister way - when it is others who are being humiliated. In the 1990s a rather innocent program was launched, a sort of precursor to reality TV, America's Funniest Home Videos. It ran for some 35 years in total. Viewers would send in videos of people falling off ladders, dropping a birthday cake, forgetting to set the parking brake, that kind of thing. Good for a laugh on video. But in real life, we don't laugh when someone falls off a ladder. It's even less funny if you are the one falling. The MAGA element finds it amusing to see their dear leader insult Canada. Canadians don't. Therein lies a difficulty for Poilievre. A vocal minority of his supporters rather like the politics of humiliation, even as Canadians have, in this moment of maximum Trump, emphatically soured on that approach. Carney, smiling with the King, skating with the Oilers, has deliberately offered the contrast of an understated pride, a comforting presence. More smiles than snarls. His minor missteps have come when he has been snarky with reporters. The politics of humiliation is driven by the desire to tear others down, to destroy. Not for nothing, then, was Carney's leadership campaign slogan ""a time to build."" Whether it is enough to construct a fourth electoral victory we shall soon see.

"Calls grow for Carney disclosure; Campaign season Poilievre, singh demand that pm reveal potential conflicts",2025.0,"Opposition parties are not letting the story of Prime Minister Mark Carney's alleged conflicts of interest fade away. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Carney to do the ""right thing"" and disclose all his financial holdings so that Canadians ""can judge the conflicts he faces"" for themselves. ""He knows what he owns and there is nothing in the law that prevents him from publishing that information for all eyes to see if he has nothing to hide,"" Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que. ""We need a leader that is busy putting Canada first, not keeping an eye on investments that go against Canadian interests,"" he added. In Hamilton, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh echoed Poilievre's call for more accountability. ""Every other candidate for prime minister has to disclose very clearly their assets,"" Singh said. ""It is an understandable thing for Canadians to make a decision about who they want to govern the country to know: Do they have any conflict of interests? What are they? ""The fact that he's unwilling to do that shows a fear of accountability, and I want Canadians to pay attention to that."" The National Post asked Carney's office to address the Opposition's statements but did not receive a response by press time. Carney admitted this week, after repeated questions from the media, that he expects to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest related to his past work as chairman at Brookfield Asset Management, which describes itself on its website as ""a leading global investment firm with over $1 trillion of assets under management."" However, Carney said the process to determine what ethical ""screens"" he would be subject to is still in discussions with the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. The process can take months, so Canadians could likely be heading to the polls in just a few weeks not knowing if Carney is subject to any conflicts of interest. ""He admitted the other day, in a stunning flip-flop, that he has conflicts of interests that he will have to manage. But he won't tell us what those conflicts are,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects us to elect him without knowing the many millions of dollars of conflicts that will make it impossible for him to do his job."" Carney has said he went beyond what the Conflict of Interest Act demands, given that he put his assets in a blind trust as soon as he was elected Liberal leader. The law - which Poilievre helped adopt when he was in Stephen Harper's government - requires that public office holders divest their assets or put them in a blind trust within 120 days. The ethics commissioner is expected to publish a public summary of Carney's personal and financial information in that same time frame, but it could be available sooner. Poilievre is effectively asking Carney to go above and beyond what the law requires, given the unusual and quick succession of events that led to him becoming prime minister. When Carney was asked this week why he is not disclosing his assets proactively, he responded that it is a question that is for the ethics commissioner. Questions have been swirling on Bay Street about Carney's financial assets and his recent links to Brookfield. Until this past January, Carney was still serving as the company's chair and head of transition investing. He stepped down to run for Liberal leader. As a Brookfield employee, according to the corporation's annual report, he was entitled to stock options with a market value of more than $6.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. But most of his compensation, observers said, is likely stemming from the money he is entitled to as co-manager of three of Brookfield's biggest funds. Conservatives have remarked Carney could find himself in conflicts of interest for clean energy transition projects, for which he raised billions of dollars across the world. Brookfield and Carney's team have so far declined to say if he has put Brookfield assets in his blind trust, but recent comments suggest that is the case. Speaking in Iqaluit on Tuesday, Carney said in French ""it's clear"" he expects an ethics screen to apply to him if a government decision ""has a major impact for Brookfield."" Carney's finance minister declined to comment on whether Carney should publicly disclose his financial assets to reassure Canadians. ""I think he answered that question,"" said François-Philippe Champagne. Poilievre, meanwhile, was questioned on his party's controversial decision to not have media outlets travelling with him in the upcoming election, which is expected to be called Sunday. ""Local media will have the ability to ask questions. It will be refreshing to hear from local outlets and what they have to say about their local priorities,"" he said. Singh said the other leaders have shown they cannot take the heat from the media. ""Well, it's no surprise to me that Pierre Poilievre is afraid of some questions,"" he said. ""I'm sorry to say I think Mark Carney is showing that as well.""

"Poilievre, Ford deny report on call for help; 'Not accurate'",2025.0,"Both Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford are denying a report suggesting the federal leader asked the premier for help on the forthcoming election campaign, but was rebuffed. ""The report is not accurate,"" Poilievre told reporters during a news conference at a union local in suburban Ottawa Friday morning. In French, he added that he had an ""excellent"" conversation with Ford. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers when they want to talk, and we talked about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production, and reversing the lost Liberal decade,"" he added, reprising many of his recent policy announcements. A Toronto Star report on Thursday cited unnamed sources who said the Conservative leader called Ford on Monday and asked him for advice on the approaching federal election. According to the Star, Ford declined to provide any guidance and told Poilievre he was focused on leading Ontario and would stay out of the federal race. The Star story said there has been no love lost between the two camps for years, with many in Poilievre's entourage saying Ford's Progressive Conser -v atives don't govern enough from the right. Later on Friday in Toronto, Ford went even further than Poilievre, and said the federal leader did not ask him for advice and the Star story was wrong. ""It was the first time I ever spoke to him. I guess what was reported was not accurate at all,"" Ford said. ""He didn't ask me for help ... so I don't know where they came up with that story."" Both leaders dodged questions about the revelations that the tone of the call was ""stilted and awkward,"" and that Ford's entourage was annoyed Poilievre did not congratulate the premier for his election win on Feb. 27.

"Poilievre trying to keep the election about the liberals; As the post-trudeau reality sinks in, tory leader looks to drive home his o wn message",2025.0,"Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump upended Canada's trade relationship with its closest neighbour, but also the affordability fight Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants to have in the next election. Soaring Conser vative confidence has now been tempered by the departure of Justin Trudeau and the upheaval south of the border, two events that have collapsed Poilievre's 20-point lead in the polls, with some surveys now suggesting he is trailing Prime Minister Mark Carney. In the lead up to Sunday's election call, anxiety and confusion has set in among some Conservatives, including within Poilievre's office, over how the leader is navigating the current moment and what an election campaign overshadowed by an unpredictable U.S. president may bring. How much that post-Trudeau reality has sunk in - and will stick - for Poilievre remains an open question, given his long-held confidence that he can drive his own message and the brand he has built for himself as having unchanged views in politics after 20 years. ""I believe that the biggest challenge for Mr. Poilievre is focusing on all those things that he is going to do and focusing less on Mark Carney,"" said Dimitri Soudas, a former director of communications for Stephen Harper, the country's most recent Conservative prime minister. ""This is a change election. So truly, all you need to do is lay out your change agenda and all you need to say is, 'You know, these guys have had 10 years.'"" To understand where the party finds itself and what it must do to win, National Post spoke with more than a dozen Conservatives, including strategists, party activists, MPs and veteran campaigners. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly about the situation. For the past two months, there have been internal debates around the merits of Poilievre sticking with his call for a ""carbon tax election"" and pushing his ""axe the tax"" message, which some Conservatives believe has staying power as a larger rallying cry for cost-of-living issues. Last month, Poilievre debuted his response to Canadians worried about the Canada-U.S. relationship at a packed ""Canada First"" rally in downtown Ottawa. He delivered a speech linking the economic situation the country finds itself back to the past nine years of Liberal rule. He has kept hammering that point since, while at the same time not abandoning the slogans and pocketbook issues Conservatives have successfully championed, including the carbon tax, which he revisited earlier in the week, even after Carney announced he was reducing the consumer tax rate to zero, beginning April 1. Poilievre's announcement that he would scrap the industrial carbon tax came after his office had in fact been considering keeping it. The Conservative leader himself had offered support for Alberta's model in past speeches in the House of Commons. The politics of the moment, however, changed the calculation. Should gas prices fall by 18 cents a litre as estimated once Carney's change takes effect in April, the push to ""axe the tax"" will lose its effectiveness, some sources say. ""It just seems like they're very unsure of themselves,"" one party insider said. ""There's no narrative."" All of this has led to some members of his entourage recently making it clear to Poilievre: He is no longer in the lead. That, one senior Conservative source suggested, has pushed the 45-year-old leader to reach out to people outside his tight circle of usual confidants to seek advice on how to best take on Carney. Poilievre has sought input on his campaign pitch from multiple caucus members, former advisers and even Ontario Premier Doug Ford, which resulted in a media report that Ford had rebuffed Poilievre but that both men disputed on Friday. Poilievre has also been working the phone with candidates who have been out door knocking and helping produce the slickly made videos the party plans to release with each new policy promise. In public, Poilievre has adopted a less biting tone and ratcheted down his attacks against Carney, who the party has running been running ads against, painting him as ""sneaky."" Campaign material sent to candidates still features familiar attacks against the new Liberal leader, branding the party the ""Carney-Trudeau Liberals,"" saying they are responsible for ""out-of-control immigration"" and support for ""job-killing carbon taxes."" Poilievre's main tag line for the campaign remains ""bring it home,"" with the m -a terial featuring other wellknown slogans of ""stop the crime"" and ""fix the budget."" Overshadowing the Conservatives' point that the Liberals are responsible for the economic vulnerability Canada faces and the price of food and housing remaining too high, especially for those under 40, is that, in the shadow of Trump, voters may choose to stick with what they know and deliver the Liberals a fourth mandate - a rarity in Canadian politics. ""In times of crisis, people like incumbencies,"" said Scott Lamb, who served as the Conservative party's president from 2016 to 2021, comparing the situation to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is noise in the system because people will be distracted, ultimately, from the things that they're unhappy with for only so long."" Getting Canadians to focus on the Liberal record instead will be Poilievre's task for the campaign. Election day could either be April 28 or May 5, with it widely anticipated that the Liberals will opt for the shortest legally allowed time frame to take advantage of the party's surge in the polls. In advance of that, Poilievre has begun pitching himself as the agent for change by calling the preceding years ""the lost Liberal decade."" Nova Scotia Sen. Michael MacDonald suggest Liberals prefer to run against Trump, which is serving as a distraction. He also dismissed Trump's comments on annexing Canada as simply ""rhetoric."" ""The election's about the economy, it's not about Donald Trump,"" he told National Post. ""Donald Trump's not running Canada,"" he said. ""Donald Trump didn't run Canada into the ground."" Heading into the campaign, the Liberal party released new ads pitching Carney, a two-time central banker, as having the economic experience to stand up against Trump's tariffs, countering Poilievre's ""Canada First"" message with Carney's pledge to keep ""Canada Strong.""

Tory plan takes aim at red tape; Poilievre seeks to lure billions of investment dollars for projects via pre-approved permit areas,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said he will ""unleash hundreds of billions of dollars of investment"" by pre-approving areas for companies to build mines, data centres, pipelines, LNG plants and other large infrastructure in Canada. The ""shovel-ready zones"" will be areas that are already permitted for development before applications are even submitted. With an election expected to be called Sunday before the House of Commons is scheduled to return on Monday, the announcement in Jonquière, Que., had all the markings of an election campaign policy promise. ""Let me be clear about this: it's not that the permits will simply be faster, it's that they will already be done,"" Poilievre said. ""Then, businesses could buy the land, move in, hire people and build, knowing they already have the permits."" The Conservatives say the proposal will have four steps: identifying areas that make sense for large projects; making sure the zone is environmentally safe; securing permits from all levels of government; and offering pre-permitting online, which would require businesses to complete a checklist. Poilievre said the plan would remove ""gatekeepers,"" a throwback to his early message that Canadian innovation and development is blocked by red tape at all levels of government. He also framed it as a way to make Canada self-sufficient in the face of a trade war with the United States. ""We will be less reliant on the Americans. In fact, we will be self-reliant, sovereign and stand on our own two feet. We will stand up to the Americans and stand up for ourselves, for a change,"" he said. The Conservative leader, who was expected to meet with Quebec Premier François Legault Thursday afternoon, was in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region where a natural gas pipeline and terminal were proposed but eventually blocked by Quebec in 2021 and Ottawa in 2022. The U.S. company behind GNL Québec, Ruby River Capital LLC, is suing the federal government for US$20 billion on the grounds that Quebec and Ottawa rejected its $14-billion LNG projects in Saguenay, Que., for political reasons. At the time, the Legault government refused the pipeline and terminal projects because it did not have ""social acceptability."" Still, environmental concerns could still be relevant in Quebec, and Greenpeace Canada said on Thursday that the Conservative policy ""amounts to a fire-sale of Canadian resources to wealthy oil, gas and mining companies."" ""The reason why companies and pension funds don't want to invest in Canada is because they know they'll spend fourteen years just getting to a 'maybe' and that they might end up in the same nightmare that these investors did,"" Poilievre said. Now, Poilievre says he will persuade Quebecers that such projects should go ahead. ""The status quo has no social acceptability. The status quo, where we sell 100 per cent of our natural gas to the United States to benefit Donald Trump, has no social acceptability ... Purchasing oil from the United States, here in Quebec, no one consulted Quebecers to ensure social acceptability with that,"" said Poilievre.

"Is Poilievre succumbing to 'Tory Syndrome?'; Conservative leader failing to adjust to new political reality, Dónal Gill writes",2025.0,"Polls are now showing that the coming federal election will be a competitive contest. This would have been unthinkable at the beginning of the year, when a Léger poll showed the lead extended to an incredible 26-point gap. The expected ballot question will be who Canadians trust to defend Canadian sovereignty from threats of economic ruin and annexation from the Trump administration. The election that Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wished for - running against Justin Trudeau and the carbon tax - has gone the way of the dodo with the arrival of Mark Carney as new Liberal leader and PM. The astonishing surge in Liberal support has, in my estimation, caught the usually highly strategically adept Tory leader flat-footed. How did we get here and what accounts for the struggles of Poilievre to adjust to a new electoral reality? Some answers to the challenges faced by the Conservative party to adapt can be found in The Tory Syndrome by George Perlin, published in 1980. It surveyed leadership politics in the old Progressive Conservative Party, using close analysis of the 1967 and 1976 leadership races to draw out a wider theory of how and why the PCs were doomed to seemingly perennial opposition status. Most importantly, Perlin characterized the titular ""Tory Syndrome"" as self-reinforcing structural defects of factionalism and an ""opposition mentality."" In what he calls ""minority party syndrome,"" Perlin describes how factionalism has run rife within conservative parties. ""Electoral defeat contributes to conflict in the party and conflict in the party contributes to its electoral defeats,"" Perlin writes. After Stephen Harper stepped aside as Tory leader in 2015, the various factions within the conservative movement struggled to unify under the leadership of, first, the socially conservative Andrew Scheer and, then, the progressive conservative Erin O'Toole. Both leaders were ultimately defenestrated following election losses in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Since becoming leader in 2022, Poilievre has been unapologetically populist. The party has been unified in lockstep behind this branding, with tight discipline being wielded by the leader's office. Concerned about bleeding votes on its right flank to Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada, which garnered 4.9 per cent of the popular vote in 2021, there was never a widely expected pivot back to the centre to appeal to moderate voters. It appeared that the conventional rules of the game were out the window. Poilievre's continued pugilistic rhetoric appeared to violate the fourth of Paul Wells's rules of politics, which states that ""the candidate who auditions for the role of opposition leader will get the job."" But Poilievre understood the assignment, which was to crest a right-wing populist wave that knocked down multiple incumbent governments across the democratic world in 2024. Then everything changed in 2025: Trudeau has made way for the technocratic former central banker, Carney. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated talk of annexation has reshuffled the political deck in Canada beyond recognition. Voters who previously may have seen Poilievre's invective style as somewhat unseemly but appropriate given the target are re-evaluating. The oft-repeated Tory refrain of the past two years that ""Canada is broken"" - once a clear winning play - is now a desperate liability in a moment of truly momentous patriotic feeling across the country. The comparisons made between the populist style of Poilievre and Trump in paid Liberal attack ads in 2024 felt to me to be tired and desperate. In the new reality of 2025, they are clearly resonating with a significant number of voters. In my view, Poilievre would be well advised to dramatically ostracize the contingent of his party base that still views Trump and his MAGA project positively. I would also counsel him to cleanse his rhetoric of overtly partisan comments that frame the dramatic threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty as the fault of anyone but the administration in Washington. In 1980, Perlin wrote that ""a party which is habitually in opposition becomes absorbed entirely in the strategy and tactics of criticism. It tends to approach all debate with an attacking, destructive style. It therefore appears to lack ideas of its own and projects a negative popular image."" Poilievre's destructive style was the tool for the job when the assignment was to beat up on Trudeau and advocate for a transformation of Canada in line with his small-government populist vision. The Conservatives appear to be held prisoner by the sunken costs of the Trudeauera attack lines and by the ""opposition mentality"" that defaults toward negative messaging that Canadians may not want in the contemporary moment.

"Calls Grow for Carney Disclosure; Campaign Season Poilievre, Singh demand PM reveal potential conflicts",2025.0,"OTTAWA . Opposition parties are not letting the story of Prime Minister Mark Carney's alleged conflicts of interest fade away. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Carney to do the ""right thing"" and disclose all his financial holdings so that Canadians ""can judge the conflicts he faces"" for themselves. ""He knows what he owns and there is nothing in the law that prevents him from publishing that information for all eyes to see if he has nothing to hide,"" Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que. ""We need a leader that is busy putting Canada first, not keeping an eye on investments that go against Canadian interests,"" he added. In Hamilton, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh echoed Poilievre's call for more accountability. ""Every other candidate for prime minister has to disclose very clearly their assets,"" Singh said. ""It is an understandable thing for Canadians to make a decision about who they want to govern the country to know: Do they have any conflict of interests? What are they? ""The fact that he's unwilling to do that shows a fear of accountability, and I want Canadians to pay attention to that."" The National Post asked Carney's office to address the Opposition's statements but did not receive a response by press time. Carney admitted this week, after repeated questions from the media, that he expects to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest related to his past work as chairman at Brookfield Asset Management, which describes itself on its website as ""a leading global investment firm with over $1 trillion of assets under management."" However, Carney said the process to determine what ethical ""screens"" he would be subject to is still in discussions with the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. The process can take months, so Canadians could likely be heading to the polls in just a few weeks not knowing if Carney is subject to any conflicts of interest. ""He admitted the other day, in a stunning flip flop, that he has conflicts of interests that he will have to manage. But he won't tell us what those conflicts are,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects us to elect him without knowing the many millions of dollars of conflicts that will make it impossible for him to do his job."" Carney has said he went beyond what the Conflict of Interest Act demands, given that he put his assets in a blind trust as soon as he was elected Liberal leader. The law - which Poilievre helped adopt when he was in Stephen Harper's government - requires that public office holders divest their assets or put them in a blind trust within 120 days. The ethics commissioner is expected to publish a public summary of Carney's personal and financial information in that same time frame, but it could be available sooner. Poilievre is effectively asking Carney to go above and beyond what the law requires, given the unusual and quick succession of events that led to him becoming prime minister. When Carney was asked this week why he is not disclosing his assets proactively, he responded that it is a question that is for the ethics commissioner. Questions have been swirling on Bay Street about Carney's financial assets and his recent links to Brookfield. Until this past January, Carney was still serving as the company's chair and head of transition investing. He stepped down to run for Liberal leader. As a Brookfield employee, according to the corporation's annual report, he was entitled to stock options with a market value of more than $6.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. But most of his compensation, observers said, is likely stemming from the money he is entitled to as co-manager of three of Brookfield's biggest funds. Conservatives have remarked Carney could find himself in conflicts of interest for clean energy transition projects, for which he raised billions of dollars across the world. Brookfield and Carney's team have so far declined to say if he has put Brookfield assets in his blind trust, but recent comments suggest that is the case. Speaking in Iqaluit on Tuesday, Carney said in French ""it's clear"" he expects an ethics screen to apply to him if a government decision ""has a major impact for Brookfield."" Carney's finance minister declined to comment on whether Carney should publicly disclose his financial assets to reassure Canadians. ""I think he answered that question,"" said François-Philippe Champagne. Poilievre, meanwhile, was questioned on his party's controversial decision to not have media outlets travelling with him in the upcoming election, which is expected to be called Sunday. ""Local media will have the ability to ask questions. It will be refreshing to hear from local outlets and what they have to say about their local priorities,"" he said. Singh said the other leaders have shown they cannot take the heat from the media. ""Well, it's no surprise to me that Pierre Poilievre is afraid of some questions."" ""I'm sorry to say I think Mark Carney is showing that as well.""

"Trump takes aim at Poilievre; Tory Leader fires back, says U.S. President would rather deal with liberals than face his 'tough' Approach",2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump said it is ""easier to deal"" with a Liberal than a Conservative, and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is taking it as a compliment. ""You know what? On that point, it's true,"" said Poilievre, speaking to reporters at a news conference hosted by a construction company Sudbury, Ont., on Wednesday. ""I'm a strong leader, I'm a tough guy to deal with. I'm firm in my convictions and I' ll always put Canada first,"" he added, referring to his latest slogan, Canada First, which he has been repeating since the start of the U.S. trade war with Canada. Poilievre said it is no wonder Trump would rather have to deal with a Liberal prime minister instead of him, pointing to how, in his view, Liberals have been blocking energy resource projects, hiking taxes and driving investments to the United States in the past nine years. He also pointed to Brookfield Asset Management's decision to move its head office from Toronto to New York City, which happened under Prime Minister Mark Carney's tenure as chair. The decision happened around the same time as Trump was re-elected for his second term in the U.S. He threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. Pointing to the workers behind him, Poilievre said: ""While these people here were worried about losing their jobs, Mark Carney was busy moving jobs to Trump's hometown. That's exactly the kind of weak, compromised, conflicted leadership that Donald Trump wants, and it's why he endorsed Mark Carney yesterday."" Trump did not explicitly endorse Carney during his interview with Fox News. In the interview, which aired Tuesday evening, Trump was asked about the changing polls in Canada that show Carney's Liberals could form the next government after the next election - overta -k ing Poilievre's Conservative party that had previously enjoyed a comfortable lead. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,"" Trump said. The U.S. president went on to take a shot at Poilievre, saying ""the Conservative that's running is stupidly no friend of mine."" ""I don't know, but he said negative things. So, when he says negative things, I couldn't care less,"" he said. It is not the first time Trump has criticized the leader of the Conservative party. In an interview with the Spectator published in February, Trump said Poilievre's ""biggest problem is he's not a MAGA guy,"" referring to his Make America Great Again slogan. ""I mean, he's really not, he's not a Trump guy at all,"" Trump added. ""Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA. I am for Canada First. Always,"" Poilievre wrote on X in response. In that same interview, Trump seemingly warned Conservatives, such as Poilievre, not to puff their chest so fast. ""They all make that mistake,"" he said. ""They think they're going to be the tough guy and they're going to knock out Trump, and they end up getting the hell beat out of 'em.""

Poilievre would OK Ring of Fire in six months; Ontario Mining,2025.0,"SUDBURY, ONT. . Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Wednesday he'll ""set a deadline"" to approve all federal permits for mining in Ontario's Ring of Fire region within six months. Poilievre said that a Conservative government would also commit $1 billion over three years to building a road network to link the mining sites to Ontario's highway network and First Nations communities in the area. ""We will make this money available by cutting foreign aid, bureaucracy, consultants, and other Liberal waste to free up money for productive investments,"" he said. Poilievre was at a construction firm in Sudbury, Ont., Wednesday, as all parties are preparing for an expected federal election call possibly just days away, a campaign in which developing Canada's resources will be a key issue. The Ring of Fire is about 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, Ont., and contains massive deposits of such critical minerals as nickel, copper, platinum and cobalt that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. They have dozens of essential applications from electric vehicles and cellphones to medical devices and solar panels. Poilievre said that because the Ring of Fire holds large deposits of critical minerals considered important to national security, Canada could claim some of the infrastructure spending in the region toward its NATO commitment to spend at least two per cent of national GDP on defence. Terms of reference to guide federal assessments of future developments in the Ring of Fire were finalized between 15 First Nations and the federal Impact Assessment Agency in January. Ontario Regional Chief Abram Benedict said that some northern First Nations are on board, while others are still going through their local decision-making processes. Benedict said that no matter what happens, the federal government can't ignore its legal obligation to consult with First Nations. Poilievre said his government would allow companies involved in Ring of Fire extraction projects to pay a portion of their federal taxes directly to First Nations communities in the area. Ontario Premier Doug Ford promised to speed up provincial approvals for Ring of Fire projects during the recent provincial election. The Ontario government only considers nine First Nations to be within the Ring of Fire region. Sol Mamakwa, Ontario NDP deputy leader and MPP for Kiiwetinoong, has criticized the provincial government's consultation efforts. Speaking at Queen's Park on Wednesday, he said First Nations can't be kept out of discussions about federal timelines. ""It needs to be done in a way where we are at the table, not on the menu,"" Mamakwa said.

"Is Poilievre succumbing to 'Tory Syndrome'?; Federal Tory leader is struggling to adjust to new reality, writes Dónal Gill",2025.0,"Polls are now showing that the coming federal election will be a competitive contest. This would have been unthinkable at the beginning of the year, when a Léger poll showed the lead extended to an incredible 26-point gap. The expected ballot question will be who Canadians trust to defend Canadian sovereignty from threats of economic ruin and annexation from the Trump administration. The election that Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wished for - running against Justin Trudeau and the carbon tax - has gone the way of the dodo with the arrival of Mark Carney as new Liberal leader and PM. The astonishing surge in Liberal support has, in my estimation, caught the usually highly strategically adept Tory leader flat-footed. How did we get here and what accounts for the struggles of Poilievre to adjust to a new electoral reality? Some answers to the challenges faced by the Conservative party to adapt can be found in The Tory Syndrome by George Perlin, published in 1980. It surveyed leadership politics in the old Progressive Conservative Party, using close analysis of the 1967 and 1976 leadership races to draw out a wider theory of how and why the PCs were doomed to seemingly perennial opposition status. Most importantly, Perlin characterized the titular ""Tory Syndrome"" as self-reinforcing structural defects of factionalism and an ""opposition mentality."" In what he calls ""minority party syndrome,"" Perlin describes how factionalism has run rife within conservative parties. ""Electoral defeat contributes to conflict in the party and conflict in the party contributes to its electoral defeats,"" Perlin writes. After Stephen Harper stepped aside as Tory leader in 2015, the various factions within the conservative movement struggled to unify under the leadership of, first, the socially conservative Andrew Scheer and, then, the progressive conservative Erin O'Toole. Both leaders were ultimately defenestrated following election losses in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Since becoming leader in 2022, Poilievre has been unapologetically populist. The party has been unified in lockstep behind this branding, with tight discipline being wielded by the leader's office. Concerned about bleeding votes on its right flank to Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada, which garnered 4.9 per cent of the popular vote in 2021, there was never a widely expected pivot back to the centre to appeal to moderate voters. It appeared that the conventional rules of the game were out the window. Poilievre's continued pugilistic rhetoric appeared to violate the fourth of Paul Wells's rules of politics, which states that ""the candidate who auditions for the role of opposition leader will get the job."" But Poilievre understood the assignment, which was to crest a right-wing populist wave that knocked down multiple incumbent governments across the democratic world in 2024. Then everything changed in 2025: Trudeau has made way for the technocratic former central banker, Carney. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated talk of annexation has reshuffled the political deck in Canada beyond recognition. Voters who previously may have seen Poilievre's invective style as somewhat unseemly but appropriate given the target are re-evaluating. The oft-repeated Tory refrain of the past two years that ""Canada is broken"" - once a clear winning play - is now a desperate liability in a moment of truly momentous patriotic feeling across the country. The comparisons made between the populist style of Poilievre and Trump in paid Liberal attack ads in 2024 felt to me to be tired and desperate. In the new reality of 2025, they are clearly resonating with a significant number of voters. In my view, Poilievre would be well advised to dramatically ostracize the contingent of his party base that still views Trump and his MAGA project positively. I would also counsel him to cleanse his rhetoric of overtly partisan comments that frame the dramatic threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty as the fault of anyone but the administration in Washington. In 1980, Perlin wrote that ""a party which is habitually in opposition becomes absorbed entirely in the strategy and tactics of criticism. It tends to approach all debate with an attacking, destructive style. It therefore appears to lack ideas of its own and projects a negative popular image."" Poilievre's destructive style was the tool for the job when the assignment was to beat up on Trudeau and advocate for a transformation of Canada in line with his small-government populist vision. The Conservatives appear to be held prisoner by the sunken costs of the Trudeauera attack lines and by the ""opposition mentality"" that defaults toward negative messaging that Canadians may not want in the contemporary moment.

Poilievre seeking to set dangerous media precedent,2025.0,"What is Pierre Poilievre afraid of? On Tuesday, Conservative national campaign director Jenni Byrne informed journalists that, in a break with tradition, the party will not allow journalists to accompany its leader on his bus or plane during the next election campaign. That means reporters will no longer be able to pay the costs of travelling along with the party leader - the way they still can with the Liberals and the NDP - so they can ask questions at news conferences, attend rallies, speak with party supporters and local candidates, rub shoulders with party organizers, and talk to people they meet along the way about how things are developing on the ground. Byrne pledged that the Conservative campaign would be ""one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory,"" and said steps are being taken to ensure media will be able to ""share any public events, participate in events on the ground, and ask questions remotely and in-person."" Those steps, she said, include two to three days' advance notice on where Poilievre will be going, so news outlets can send reporters to cover him. She also said the campaign will provide an ""equitable balance"" at all news conferences between local and national media - in effect limiting the number of questions political reporters get to ask. The Conservatives will also offer a professional-quality live video feed to broadcasters - an attempt to ensure the party gets Poilievre's message on TV networks unfiltered, and without him having to respond to questions from television reporters. (It's an effort the mainstream broadcasters are determined not to participate in, though ethnic media and outfits with less money may jump at the opportunity to receive free content.) This is all an attempt by the Conservative party to limit the scrutiny that Poilievre will face in the contest to become the country's next prime minister. It's an effort to muzzle the mainstream media, to be less answerable and less accountable to the public. It's a dangerous precedent that should be loudly condemned. It is certainly not the kind of action a party that purports to stand for freedom should take. Ironically, Byrne's email arrived a day after Conservative MPs took to social media to praise journalists who, while travelling with Prime Minister Mark Carney, got under his skin while questioning him about potential conflicts of interest. In other words, the Conservatives are pleased to see reporters doing their jobs on the Liberal leader's plane, but they don't want to be held to the same standard. Byrne frames her decision to exclude reporters from the campaign buses and planes as a budgetary one. ""As you are aware, costs for travel have risen considerably,"" she wrote. ""At the same time, so has the capacity for digital and remote access to public events. Lastly, as you might recall, in recent years, media outlets often opted to deploy resources from their closest available local bureau rather than fly a journalist from Ottawa across the entire country for the entire duration of the campaign."" She's right that travel costs have risen considerably - but that's a reason why the media needs access to the Conservative tour. It saves time and money to not have to sort out logistics, and chasing Poilievre's plane and bus will require more journalists, more camera operators, more flights, more time, more costs. This move is unlikely to save news outlets any money. It's not even a cost saving to the Conservatives. Parties charge journalists for the privilege to travel with them - in 2015, the bill for travelling with the Conservatives was $3,000 a day. Parties are not allowed to either subsidize reporters' costs on the campaign trail or turn a profit from selling them seats. This is an attempt to discourage the mainstream media from following the Conservative tour, to tell them it's not worth their time and money to show up. Maybe I am cynical. Or maybe I have been covering federal politics for nearly two decades. Why are the Conservatives bucking tradition and kicking the media off the plane? It's no secret the Conservatives have never liked having reporters accompany them. Some believe the press gallery is full of left-leaning journalists who don't give them a fair shake. In Stephen Harper's 2011 campaign, the media was penned in far away from the leader and Conservative supporters and only allowed to ask five questions: four for the travelling journalists, one for the local reporters. Ditto for 2015, when Byrne was also the campaign manager. But a lot has changed in the last 10 years. The importance of social media has significantly increased. Canadians are getting their news less from traditional news sources - the morning newspaper, the local super-hour newscast - and more from digital platforms, many of which can be accessed without a subscription. Only 16 per cent of English-speaking Canadians say they pay for news, according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report for 2024. The parties now shape their messages and distribute them directly to those they hope to mobilize. Every year, the mainstream media declines in importance. We should not be surprised by Poilievre's and Byrne's actions. The Conservatives already choose not to hold news conferences in the National Press Theatre, where they don't control who asks the questions. Away from Parliament Hill, Poilievre's team often decides which reporters ask questions - and there are no followups. Poilievre has also picked fights with the journalists who ask him probing questions. Rather than answer, he attacks: the CBC, the Canadian Press, freelance reporters he doesn't like. Perhaps, journalists should have been pushing back more vocally and frequently. But that's not easy when the Conservative leader accuses the media of being partisan, influenced by government tax subsidies, and when trust in the media has declined. But if we don't speak out, who will?

Based on my recollections of the time leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, my impression is that individuals do have both short and selective memories. Stephen Harper advised us that his government was on a path towards deregulating Canada's financial institutions.

"Poilievre touts t ech over tax; Vows to kill industrial carbon tax, but some groups argue the idea is misguided",2025.0,"Multiple climate policy groups and researchers said Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's promise to abolish the industrial pricing scheme is misguided. They argue that it is in fact an effective tool to incentivize low-carbon investments in Canada. ""Dismantling industrial carbon pricing would be a mistake that robs Canada of a critical tool to attract billions in investment and create jobs across the country,"" Clean Prosperity president Michael Bernstein said. In a separate statement, the Canadian Climate Institute argued that the industrial carbon pricing system contributes to three times more emissions reductions than the consumer carbon tax and does not directly raise prices for the public. Poilievre announced on Monday that if his party wins government in the upcoming election, he would repeal the carbon tax legislation - including the industrial carbon tax - and boost federal tax credits to reward companies that lower emissions. The move follows a decision on Friday by new Prime Minister Mark Carney to reduce the price of the consumer carbon tax to zero, which means Canadians will no longer pay it on fuels. However, the legislation establishing the tax and the one for industrial emitters, the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, remains in place. At a press conference at a steel mill in L'Orignal, Que., on Mo -n day, Poilievre said his government would repeal the entire law and scrap both the consumer and the industrial carbon pricing schemes. It's the first time he publicly confirmed he would also cut the industrial scheme, known as the output-based pricing system. ""There will be no taxes on consumers, no taxes on Canadian industries. Instead, provinces will continue to have the freedom to address this issue how they like, but there will be no federal obligation to impose the tax,"" Poilievre said at a lectern adorned with a large ""Axe the Tax"" sign. The output-based pricing system is a federal backstop program that charges large emitters if they exceed a certain threshold of emissions. It only applies to a handful of provinces and territories (Manitoba, P.E.I, Yukon and Nunavut) as the majority of them have their own systems. Alberta was the first province to put in place an industrial carbon pricing scheme in 2007. Premier Danielle Smith said on Monday that she welcomed the Conservative Leader's announcement. ""We fully support Pierre Poilievre's commitment to return jurisdictional authority back to the provinces to regulate their own industrial emissions,"" said Smith in a joint statement with Environment Minister Rebecca Schulz. ""Currently, the federal government imposes onerous standards and requirements on all systems throughout Canada, whether or not a province maintains its own system or is subject to the federal backstop."" The Conservative leader promised to expand the clean technology and clean manufacturing investment tax credit to encourage companies to lower emissions. The Liberals introduced the tax credits in the last two years to help drive investment to the production and operation of things like solar power, battery storage or manufacturing systems that make clean technology such as industrial robots that make electric vehicles. Carney argued that cutting taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum production, which emits less carbon than that of foreign producers such as China, will push those foreign companies to move production here, lowering global emission in the process. ""While the Liberals tax businesses who use energy, Conservatives will cut taxes and boost incentives for those who bring down emissions. Carrot, not stick,"" Poilievre said. ""Cutting taxes on clean production will bring jobs and production home and bring global emissions down,"" he added, arguing that he will use ""technology, not taxes, to protect our environment."" Asked if he was prepared to commit Canada to any form of emissions target if he is elected prime minister, Poilievre demurred. ""What would my emissions target look like? I treat this as a global problem. By bringing home production from more polluting foreign jurisdictions, we reduce global emissions while growing our own paycheques,"" he said. In ""axing the tax"" on Friday, Carney was cribbing from Poilievre, who has spent the past two years criss-crossing the country campaigning on a promise to get rid of the consumer carbon tax and blaming it for the higher costs of food and fuel in the country. Technically, Carney didn't remove the tax, but scaled the price to zero through regulation. Canadians on track to receive a carbon-tax rebate due to be sent out next month should still expect to receive one. Carney has said it will be the final payment. Heather Exner-Pirot, a special adviser on energy issues to the Business Council of Canada, says she suspects Poilievre's promise will get mixed reaction in corporate boardrooms. ""Some companies have made investments based on an expectation of price certainty and continuity,"" she said. ""Others will be grateful we are now slightly more competitive in attracting capital, especially vis-a-vis American companies,"" she added. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson called Poilievre's proposal ""bad policy"" from an environmental and economic perspective. ""(Mr. Poilievre) should actually have a look at what's happening with things like border carbon adjustments in Europe, where they are going to be looking at the carbon content in order to actually be able to have goods that actually are exported there,"" Wilkinson said. ""Otherwise, they're going to get tariffed. So, it's just so silly what he is proposing.""

Poilievre won't allow reporters to travel with him during campaign,2025.0,"When Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre hits the campaign trail in an imminently expected federal election campaign, he won't be accompanied by a contingent of news outlets. Media were notified Tuesday by Conservative National Campaign Director Jenni Byrne that reporters would be unable join Poilievre on his party's bus or plane, ""though we welcome and encourage participation at all public events,"" Byrne's email read. The Liberals and New Democrats have confirmed that media will be permitted to join their leaders on their cross-country election tours. Typically, major federal parties invite media to travel - on their own dime - with party leaders, campaign staff and top aides during election campaigns. Doing so often allows reporters to accompany leaders on their campaign buses and planes, giving them access to key staffers and events like news conferences, campaign rallies and whistle stops. ""We would like to assure you that this campaign will be one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory.

We might get carbon taæ election after all; Poilievre shifts to industrial polluters,2025.0,"It looked for a moment as if the Conservatives would be lumbered with thousands of redundant ""Axe the Tax"" signs, billboards and placards after new Liberal Leader Mark Carney promised to kill the consumer carbon tax. But some auick thinking by the Conservative party brain-trust means we can still have a carbon tax election and they can recycle all the campaign paraphernalia. Pierre Poilievre, standing proudly behind an Axe the Tax lectern sign, announced on Monday that he will not only kill the consumer carbon tax but remove the federal backstop to the industrial carbon tax that is doing the heavy lifting when it comes to reducing Canada's emissions. Carney wants to expand the ""shadow carbon tax,"" Poilievre said. Combined with President Donald Trump's tariffs, the industrial tax is a ""disaster for workers"" that will see money and jobs leave Canada, he added. The Liberals see things differently. Carney was relatively relaxed about killing the consumer carbon tax because it contributes less than 10 per cent of emissions reductions, compared to three times that impact for the industrial schemes. Carney argues ""large polluters"" like steel companies have a choice: reduce emissions or pay Canadians to emit. He told CTV that we are ""leapfrogging"" the Americans, who have no carbon pricing system in place. Last May, he told the Senate banking committee that countries that don't take measures to reduce carbon will see their trade access cut off through measures such as the border-adjustment mechanism (a carbon tariff) that has been adopted by the European Union and that Carney wants here. If he stays as prime minister, Carney will move in the opposite direction to Poilievre on industrial carbon pricing. But there is less to the Conservative leader's announcement than meets the eye, even if he wins the upcoming election. Industrial carbon pricing is run by the provinces, most of which have their own regimes. Alberta's Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) scheme has been around since 2007, surviving governments of all stripes, despite former premier Jason Kenney and current Premier Danielle Smith running on ""Axe the Tax"" platforms against the consumer tax. Unlike the consumer tax, there is ono groundswell of opinion to kill output-based pricing and Poilievre has ono authority to completely get rid of it. He said provinces will have the freedom to address the issue as they like and there will be ono federal obligation to have an industrial carbon tax. Yet, there are likely to be implications, should the Conservatives win the election. One source suggested that Smith is likely to pause its future industrial carbon-tax increases - Alberta is scheduled to hit $170 per tonne of co2 by 2030 and may even cancel the whole system. ""It's on the table, for sure,"" he said. TIER is a cap-and-trade system, and there are already concerns that there are too many carbon credits, which reduces the incentive to invest in decarbonization. Credits trade for somewhere close to $40 a tonne, far below the headline price of $80 per tonne. Ending TIER and its counterparts in other provinces would leave Canada without a carbon reduction plan. The Canadian Climate Institute's assessment of the federal government's emissions-reduction plan said that Canada is on course to hit 440 megatonnes of emissions by 2030, compared to 775 megatonnes if there is no climate policy. The Conservatives appear to be set to go into the election campaign without any concrete proposals to reduce greenhouse gases. By killing the consumer tax, the industrial emitter backstop, the oil and gas cap and the clean fuel charge, Poilievre will rely almost exclusively on the ""technology not taxes"" mantra: the use of investment tax credits to incentivize technology adoption. That may prove to be enough to win an election, at least, if not fight climate change. It remains a top-ti- er concern for many Canadians, according to opinion polls, but it has been relegated down the list by Trump's tariffs and cost-of-living worries. There may be ono public pressure to do anything much about climate change if the economy is shrinking. At the same time, Alberta has just updated its proven gas reserves to nearly six times the level from the last assessment. Oil reserves have been boosted by seven billion barrels, at a time when the era of shale growth in the U.S. is coming to an end, regardless of Trump's cries of ""drill, baby, drill."" This industry is not going away and, as Canada looks to diversify its customer base, the pressures to decarbonize its resources will grow. The industrial carbon pricing system is ""a strategic asset"" for growing and strengthening Canadian industry, said Michael Bernstein, president and CEO of the Clean Prosperity climate advocacy group. He argues that a stringent industrial carbon price is the most cost-effective way to lure investment. It also acts as an antidote to arguments made by former environment minister Steven Guilbeault and others about the need for an oil and gas emissions cap, since it allows for more production without necessarily increasing pollution. Carney's hopes of success in the election probably rest on talking about Trump often and about climate change never. But it seems unlikely he will be able to resist weighing in on this move. Poilievre may well get his carbon tax election after all.

Poilievre slams new Liberal leader ahead of visit to Sudbury; Conservative leader to hold a Bring it Home Rally,2025.0,"The Liberals may have a new leader, but Mark Carney is no different from the previous federal governments under Justin Trudeau. That's the message Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will bring to Sudbury on Wednesday as he holds a Bring it Home Rally at 6 p.m. at the Radisson Hotel. ""A fourth Liberal term with Mark Carney in office will be just like the previous three,"" Poilievre said in a message to supporters. ""It'll mean higher taxes, higher housing costs, more food bank lineups and raging crime in our streets. We can't let that happen. ""Only a Common Sense Conservative government led by Pierre Poilievre will put Canada first and axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Let's rally together to help make it happen and bring home the Canada we know and love."" Carney was sworn in to succeed Trudeau at a ceremony at Rideau Hall Friday, along with a leaner Liberal cabinet, ahead of an election call that is expected soon. In his first press conference as prime minister, Carney said his government will focus on growing the economy, making life more affordable and making the country more secure. Poilievre, however, has gone on the attack against his new rival. Last week, he said Carney should have been fired when he was governor of the Bank of England, arguing that the new Canadian prime minister's economic record isn't as strong as he presents it. Poilievre, speaking to reporters hours after Carney was sworn in as Canada's new leader, said Carney had acted as an ""unreliable boyfriend"" while leading the central bank from 2013 to 2020. That's a reference to a quote from British lawmaker Pat McFadden, who criticized Carney over a decade ago for not following through after signalling plans to hike interest rates. Poilievre accused Carney of ""changing his mind constantly"" as Bank of England governor and ""printing too much money, which led to inflation,"" Bloomberg News reported. Annual inflation averaged about 1.6 per cent in the UK while Carney led the bank and he left in March 2020, meaning he did not oversee much of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic - after which it surged, peaking above 11 per cent in late 2022, Bloomberg said. ""Mark Carney should have been fired when he was the head of the Bank of England,"" Poilievre said. Bloomberg said the comments illustrate the battle lines for an election campaign that is almost certain to be focused on which leader is best to manage the economy and handle a trade war with the US and President Donald Trump. Poilievre, the Conservative leader since 2022, built a significant lead in opinion polls by focusing on inflation, housing shortages and other economic issues. That lead has narrowed - and in some surveys, it has disappeared altogether - after Trudeau resigned and Carney won a vote to replace him as Liberal leader. Closer to home, the website 338Canada says the Liberals are currently leading in Sudbury and would get 38 per cent of the vote if a federal were held now and the Conservatives 34 per cent. It also says that in the new riding of Sudbury East-Manitoulin-Nickel Belt, it's a toss-up between the Liberals and the Conservatives. In fact, it says the parties would each get 32 per cent of the votes if the election were held today.

It remains a top-tier concern for many Canadians, according to opinion polls, but it has been relegated down the list by Trump's tariffs and cost-of-living worries. There may be Ono public pressure to do anything much about climate change if the economy is shrinking. At the same time, Alberta has just updated its proven gas reserves to nearly six times the level from the last assessment. Oil reserves have been boosted by seven billion barrels, at a time when the era of shale growth in the U.S. is coming to an end, regardless of Trump's cries of ""drill, baby, drill."" This industry is not going away and, as Canada looks to diversify its customer base, the pressures to decarbonize its resources will grow. The industrial carbon pricing system is ""a strategic asset"" for growing and strengthening Canadian industry, said Michael Bernstein, president and CEO of the Clean Prosperity climate advocacy group. He argues that a stringent industrial carbon price is the most cost-effective way to lure investment. It also acts as an antidote to arguments made by former environment minister Steven Guilbeault and others about the need for an oil and gas emissions cap, since it allows for more production without necessarily increasing pollution. Carney's hopes of success in the election probably rest on talking about Trump often and about climate change never. But it seems unlikely he will be able to resist weighing in on this move. Poilievre may well get his carbon tax election after all.

"Poilievre vows to kill carbon tax; Publicly confirms for first time that he would repeal entire law, including industrial charge",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he will repeal the carbon tax legislation - including the industrial carbon tax - and boost federal tax credits to reward companies that lower emissions. The move comes on the heels of a decision on Friday by new Prime Minister Mark Carney to reduce the price of the consumer carbon tax rate to zero, which means Canadians will no longer pay it on fuels. The legislation for pricing pollution, Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, remains in place. During a press conference in L'Orignal, Que., on Monday, Poilievre said his government would repeal the entire law and scrap both the consumer and industrial carbon pricing schemes. It's the first time he publicly confirmed he would also cut the industrial scheme, known as the output-based pricing system. ""There will be no taxes on consumers, no taxes on Canadian in-dustries. Instead, provinces will continue to have the freedom to address this issue how they like, but there will be no federal obligation to impose the tax,"" Poilievre said at a lectern adorned with a large ""axe the tax"" sign. The output-based pricing system is a federal backstop program that charges large emitters if they exceed a certain threshold of emissions. It only applies to a handful of provinces and territories (Mani-toba, P.E.I, Yukon and Nunavut) as the majority of them have their own systems. In both a video posted to social media and the subsequent press conference, Poilievre accused Carney of planning to hike the carbon tax after the next election. ""Conservatives will use technology, not taxes, to protect our environment,"" he said in the video. If the party forms government, the Conservative leader promised to expand the clean technology and clean manufacturing investment tax credit to encourage companies to lower emissions. For example, Poilievre argued that cutting taxes on Canadian steel and aluminium production, which emits less carbon than that of other countries such as China, will push those foreign companies to move production here, lowering global emission in the process. ""While the Liberals tax businesses who use energy, Conservatives will cut taxes and boost incentives for those who bring down emissions. Carrot, not stick,"" Poilievre said. ""Cutting taxes on clean production will bring jobs and production home and bring global emissions down,"" he added. Asked if he was prepared to commit Canada to any form of emissions target if he is elected prime minister, Poilievre demurred. ""What would my emissions target look like? I treat this as a global problem. By bringing home production from more polluting foreign jurisdictions, we reduce global emissions while growing our own pay- cheques,"" he said. In ""axing the tax"" on F -ri day, Carney was cribbing from Poilievre, who has spent the past two years criss-crossing the country campaigning on a promise to get rid of the consumer carbon tax and blaming it for the higher costs of food and fuel in the country. Technically, Carney didn't remove the tax, but scaled the price to zero through regulation. Canadians on track to receive a carbon-tax rebate due to be sent out next month should still expect to receive one.

"Khan's silence may well be golden with PC party members, but Manitobans will want answers",2025.0,"The sound that you are not hearing right now is the voice of Obby Khan, the man who, in all likelihood, will become leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba, leader of the official opposition and applicant for the job of first minister. From the moment he declared his candidacy last August, Khan has declined opportunity after opportunity to make his positions clear on the two lingering issues from the 2023 election. Those issues — staunch opposition to searching the Prairie Green Landfill for the Indigenous victims of a serial killer and support for the anti-LGBTTQ+ “parent rights” movement — continue to hang around the neck of the party like an anvil. For the foreseeable future, every time the Tories enter an election, they will be bombarded with quotes and images from their toxic, offensive 2023 campaign. The only hope the party has to shed these issues and project a kinder, gentler face to the electorate is an act of catharsis, a full admission of the mistakes and a convincing apology. To date, however, Khan has not been able to find the intestinal fortitude to resolve these awful issues. Even when his party has made some attempts. Interim PC leader Wayne Ewasko acknowledged recently in the Manitoba legislature the Tories “lost our way” in the 2023 campaign. Lamentably, it wasn’t a clear, clean moment of catharsis. Ewasko’s apology came a week after human remains were discovered at the landfill and days before the remains were confirmed to be that of Morgan Harris, one of the serial killer’s victims. It’s fair to ask whether Ewasko’s apology would have come at all had remains not been found. More lamentable has been leadership front-runner Khan’s steadfast delay in endorsing Ewasko’s apology. In June, when it appeared obvious Khan was going to enter the leadership race, I requested an interview to talk about the landfill search, parental rights and his absence from the legislature during a vote on a private member’s bill establishing a day of recognition for transgender Manitobans. In an email, Khan said he missed the vote because of a doctor’s appointment. He said while he supported the intent of the private member’s bill, he didn’t want to do an interview until later in the summer. Needless to say, the interview later in the summer never materialized. Khan’s leadership campaign, however, did. Did the former Winnipeg Blue Bombers player use this event to start clearing the air on landfill searches and parental rights? Absolutely not. Khan told The Canadian Press last August he would address both controversial issues “as we go forward.” The campaign has gone forward, but Khan remains mired in his refusal to discuss inconvenient issues. On the day Ewasko made his apology on behalf of the PC party, Khan refused to indicate where he stood on the issue, promising he would have a statement “going forward on that.” Last week, in an interview with the Free Press , leadership rival Wally Daudrich unequivocally said it was a mistake to balk on searching the landfill. That same day, Khan finally indicated support for the apology but also posted on X that it was “important to set the record straight as we work to rebuild trust with our members and Manitobans.” His social media post was a triumph of obfuscation. With due respect, the challenge facing the party is not setting the record straight. The Tory record from the 2023 campaign is very clear: the landfill ads were cynical and racist. Khan’s challenge is to either embrace or disown that strategy. Similar obfuscation surrounds his position on parental rights. Khan was the face of television, web and print advertisements promising that a re-elected Tory government would enhance “parental rights.” Although then-leader Heather Stefanson never defined what the party meant by parental rights, it was patently obvious the Tories were borrowing the rallying cry used by socially conservative radicals who oppose LGBTTQ+ rights, critical race theory and sex education. Does Khan support the noxious parental-rights movement? Your guess is as good as mine. At a meet-and-greet event for party members in Winnipeg in October, Khan dodged direct questions about parental rights while suggesting his definition dealt more with the safeguarding of children “that may not come from a safe home, that may be abused at home, that may not have a safe place.” With respect, that is not what parental rights means in a political context. Why is it so hard for Khan to come out and make it clear to party members and the general public that he didn’t agree with the tone of the 2023 election campaign? One possibility is that he actually agrees with the messaging. That is a long bow to draw, given that Khan has made other statements that, if viewed in a charitable light, seem to contradict the toxic nature of the 2023 campaign. The other possibility is that “going forward,” as Khan likes to say, he wants to keep his options open. Either way, it’s important for Khan to start doing longer interviews and explaining who he really is and what he really thinks. Deafening silence may win leadership campaigns, but it won’t carry the day during an election. dan.lett@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Dan Lett","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Lett, Dan",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 18, 2025",Parental rights; Leadership; Serial murders; Landfill; Human remains,,2025-03-18,Winnipeg Free Press
Poilievre can play victim at own peril,2025.0,"If Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives lose the next federal election, it will not be because the Liberals changed leaders. It will be because the narrative of the election changed, and Poilievre couldn't find the right role for himself in the new story. There are really only three roles in any narrative: the hero, the villain and the victim. When advising clients in crisis communications, we emphasize the importance of understanding which of these roles fits best for the purposes of public perception. Depending on the narrative, a person or organization in the middle of a crisis can make any of the three work well for them. That is less true in politics. In a political crisis, it's possible to play the role of victim - it might even help with your public image - but nobody votes for them in a crisis. Poilievre and his team have spent years honing the narrative that Canada is broken and that he is the hero to fix it. They cast Justin Trudeau as their villain, and like a comic movie franchise, they rolled him out over and over again as Canadians' chief antagonist. That approach worked well enough to see the Conservatives regularly lead the Liberals by 15 to 20 points in most polls. As recently as December, the party was poised for a massive majority win in the coming federal election. Enter Donald Trump, tariffs and an enormous plot twist. The U.S. president's threats to annex Canada, not to mention his unjustified attacks on our economy, our jobs and our very existence, changed the narrative for the next election. The sheer scope of media coverage, as well as the potential for personal impact, meant this new narrative was being heard by more people who found it more relevant than the story of a broken nation Poilievre had been peddling. In grocery stores and hockey arenas, in TV ads for Canadian companies and on the stage of ""Saturday Night Live,"" Canada and Canadians rallied to face this new challenge together. They demonstrated a clear understanding of who the villain was in this story. Unfortunately for Poilievre, it wasn't Trudeau. Poilievre needed Trudeau as his villain for his story of a broken Canada. Without the Joker, Batman is just a rich guy with unresolved trauma and anger issues. He gets to be the hero only because the alternative - a psychopathic killer clown - is worse than the idea of a billionaire vigilante. Trudeau's swift and stoic response to the threat of tariffs and takeover thrust him quickly into the role of hero. Proof that this wasn't a partisan casting choice came when Premier Doug Ford donned his Captain Canada cape, too, taking swift action and making retaliatory threats of his own against the common enemy in the White House. In choosing to stick with partisan talking points about carbon taxes and crime, Poilievre appeared more interested in laying blame than in finding solutions. It made it seem like the only answer he had was to blame Trudeau, the only emotion he could muster was anger and the only action he could take was to lay blame. Poilievre came across as a victim when the country was looking for a hero. People might empathize with victims, but they are not looking to elect one to defend Canada from an economic and existential threat. It is widely expected that newly minted Prime Minister Mark Carney will call for a federal election in very short order. If he does, the ballot question and narrative of the election will still be focused on how to handle foreign relations, trade and tariffs, as Canada's oldest ally becomes an ever more dire threat. Events have rewritten the story of this election. If Poilievre cannot find a way to write himself a new role, he could go from Conservative hero who played the victim to the villain who lost his party its best chance in a decade to form government.

"In 2011, Harper said Carney was right choice",2025.0,"First, a disclaimer. I am not a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. I do not support them, or their candidate in the upcoming election. But I ran across this the other day, and in the interest of accuracy and fairness thought I should share it. Recently, Stephen Harper said that Mark Carney takes too much credit for Canada's performance in the 2008 crisis. Here's what a Canadian government press release said in 2011, when Harper was prime minister: ""The selection of Mr. Carney as chair of the Financial Stability Board is testament to his skills and to the strength of Canada's financial system,"" said the prime minister. ""This is the right appointment at the right time as the world works to strengthen the global financial system and sustain the fragile global economic recovery.

The FSB plays a key role in advancing G-20 financial reforms, including monitoring and reporting on their implementation. ""For four years in a row, the World Economic Forum has rated Canada's banking system as the soundest in the world.

Poilievre owns his 'Grating' Style; Charm Offensive Ads aim to explain bluntness to Quebec voters,2025.0,"OTTAWA. A new Frenchlanguage advertisement starring Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre begins uncharacteristically for a campaign ad, with Poilievre offering an admission that his style of politics can seem brusque at times, especially to Quebecers. ""Some people think my style is too direct, too blunt,"" says Poilievre, leaning on a desk and smiling. The party and Poilievre want to explain his style to Quebec voters, according to sources who spoke on background. The Conservative party launched its biggest radio, TV and online ad campaign to date in Quebec to show how approachable he is, how funny he can be and why he does politics the way he does. Poilievre's office did not comment on this story. ""I wonder, should we be cute and docile when negotiating tariffs with Donald Trump? Let's take back control and put Canada first,"" says Poilievre in one of the three versions of the ad. Alain Rayes, the former Quebec lieutenant to Conservative leaders Andrew Scheer and Erin O' Toole, who is now an independent MP, saw the ad over the weekend where the relaxed Poilievre tries to explain himself to Quebecers. ""I think he will convince people,"" he said. ""When you meet him, he is very friendly. I still believe he is an extremely smart politician. But he uses techniques that I disapprove of,"" he added. Rayes knows a thing or two about Poilievre's style. He was attacked by the party in an automated text message sent out to party members in his riding of Richmond-Arthabaska days after Poilievre was elected leader in 2022. At the time, Rayes had just led Jean Charest's failed leadership campaign and had left the Conservative caucus because his ""political ideals, values and convictions (were) not compatible"" with those of Poilievre. The attack implied that Rayes had quit the Conservative party because he ""decided not to fight (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau's inflation with Pierre Poilievre's united team."" The party then apologized. ""There is kind of a moral endorsement by the tone that Pierre Poilievre uses. So, these people were reassured with the overwhelming victory they had during the leadership race. They felt that they had the right strategy and tone,"" said Rayes in an interview with the National Post. Rayes is just one example of Poilievre's targets. The leader gives his opponents nicknames. He has called the mayors of Montreal and Quebec City ""incompetent"" and has argued for months that the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party of Canada are in a coalition, when they are not. ""In Quebec, the Republican-style politics doesn't jive,"" said a Conservative source. But Poilievre wants to win in Quebec, sources tell us. In fact, he may even need Quebec, especially with the Liberals surging in the polls. With 10 seats, the Conservatives are hoping to boost their fortunes in the next election by flipping Bloc seats in Centredu-Québec, Quebec City and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Eric Blais, the president of Headspace Marketing, who has worked for more than 40 years in marketing and communications in English and French Canada, said he was surprised by Poilievre's apparent admission that he has a ""grating sort of style,"" a style that isn't exactly ""endearing with many Quebecers."" ""So he's trying to address the elephant in the room, but I don't think he is, because to then pivot and suggest that that very style is what's needed to fight Trump. 'I'm the right guy, because I have a style that is, that can be disruptive, that can be grating', I'm not so sure Quebecers are going to buy that,"" said Blais. According to him, Poilievre still has a ""Je ne sais quoi"", something that just doesn't land with this electorate. ""These videos confirm that he knows it. Though it might be a strength to fight Trump, this admission will not make him more sympathetic in the minds of Quebec voters,"" he suggested. Sources close to him would not say whether Poilievre intends to change his style. ""He's himself and he speaks for himself,"" one of them said. So, what is the offer to Quebecers?

Poilievre Owns his 'grating' style; Charm Offensive Ads aim to explain bluntness to Quebec voters,2025.0,"A new Frenchlanguage advertisement starring Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre begins uncharacteristically for a campaign ad, with Poilievre offering an admission that his style of politics can seem brusque at times, especially to Quebecers. ""Some people think my style is too direct, too blunt,"" says Poilievre, leaning on a desk and smiling. The party and Poilievre want to explain his style to Quebec voters, according to sources who spoke on background. The Conservative party launched its biggest radio, TV and online ad campaign to date in Quebec to show how approachable he is, how funny he can be and why he does politics the way he does. Poilievre's office did not comment on this story. ""I wonder, should we be cute and docile when negotiating tariffs with Donald Trump? Let's take back control and put Canada first,"" says Poilievre in one of the three versions of the ad. Alain Rayes, the former Quebec lieutenant to Conservative leaders Andrew Scheer and Erin O' Toole, who is now an independent MP, saw the ad over the weekend where the relaxed Poilievre tries to explain himself to Quebecers. ""I think he will convince people,"" he said. ""When you meet him, he is very friendly. I still believe he is an extremely smart politician. But he uses techniques that I disapprove of,"" he added. Rayes knows a thing or two about Poilievre's style. He was attacked by the party in an automated text message sent out to party members in his riding of Richmond-Arthabaska days after Poilievre was elected leader in 2022. At the time, Rayes had just led Jean Charest's failed leadership campaign and had left the Conservative caucus because his ""political ideals, values and convictions (were) not compatible"" with those of Poilievre. The attack implied that Rayes had quit the Conservative party because he ""decided not to fight (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau's inflation with Pierre Poilievre's united team."" The party then apologized. ""There is kind of a moral endorsement by the tone that Pierre Poilievre uses. So, these people were reassured with the overwhelming victory they had during the leadership race. They felt that they had the right strategy and tone,"" said Rayes in an interview with the National Post. Rayes is just one example of Poilievre's targets. The leader gives his opponents nicknames. He has called the mayors of Montreal and Quebec City ""incompetent"" and has argued for months that the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party of Canada are in a coalition, when they are not. ""In Quebec, the Republican-style politics doesn't jive,"" said a Conservative source. But Poilievre wants to win in Quebec, sources tell us. In fact, he may even need Quebec, especially with the Liberals surging in the polls. With 10 seats, the Conservatives are hoping to boost their fortunes in the next election by flipping Bloc seats in Centredu-Québec, Quebec City and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Eric Blais, the president of Headspace Marketing, who has worked for more than 40 years in marketing and communications in English and French Canada, said he was surprised by Poilievre's apparent admission that he has a ""grating sort of style,"" a style that isn't exactly ""endearing with many Quebecers."" ""So he's trying to address the elephant in the room, but I don't think he is, because to then pivot and suggest that that very style is what's needed to fight Trump ...

"He's got the job - but can he do it?; In a battle with Poilievre, even liberals think Mark Carney's Political skills need improvement",2025.0,"Mark Carney may have been crowned leader of the Liberal party by casting himself as a political outsider, but his skills as a politician need work, say some of his supporters. Carney walked into an Ottawa convention centre Sunday as the presumed front-runner of the four candidates who were vying to replace Justin Trudeau as leader and prime minister. He left with a crushing firstballot victory not matched by Trudeau or even Carney's political foe in the next election: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. With Carney open to calling a snap election by mid-March, National Post spoke with nearly 20 Liberals, many of whom support Carney, about how the two-time central banker will have to reconcile his political newcomer status with the demands of the campaign trail. ""He has room to grow, for sure,"" said Liberal member Lucy Wright. ""He'll have a lot of supporters and as long as he listens to the people who are actually knowledgeable, I think he'll do well."" For Cathie Devries, that means putting an end to the questions Poilievre's Conservatives have been raising about his former role at Brookfield Asset Management. ""He needs to jump on that,"" she said. The (Conservative) party is trying to sow doubt. The Liberals and the party need to do a better job explaining that."" While Carney has tried, Devries says ""some of the numbers and some of the answers don't add up."" Carney said he stepped down as chairman of the company when he launched his campaign back in January. After one of the party's debates, he told reporters he was not involved in the firm's decision to move its headquarters from Toronto to New York - a move the Tories are hammering, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump wants to attract companies south of the border. Poilievre's office then released a letter showing that Carney told shareholders to vote in favour of the move, which they say is evidence Carney had lied to Canadians. Carney later acknowledged that he should have been more ""precise"" in his initial explanation. Longtime Liberal Bridget Girard pointed to the ads the Tories have already been running against Carney, labelling him as ""sneaky,"" as one of the challenges the new Liberal leader will face. Past Liberal leaders have struggled to recover from Conservative ad campaigns that defined them in the minds of voters. The best way to beat what Girard characterizes as the Tories' ""same old tired tricks"" is for Carney to ""just be genuine."" As a supporter, she expects him to speak to media more, which Carney did sparingly throughout the campaign, especially with the Parliamentary Press Gallery. Raymond LaFrance, who has been a Liberal supporter for 20 years and voted for Carney, says while he believes Carney's economic experience makes him the right man to lead Canada as it faces Trump's threats of tariffs and annexation, he worries about his French. ""He might come across a little bit as inexperienced,"" LaFrance said, saying Carney will face much different questions as a politician than he did as a central banker. ""He's going to be picked on, yelled at."" Christian Nkanu, a Francophone from New Brunswick, also cited Carney's French as an issue and a change from what the party has been used to under Trudeau. ""We can understand, but I think it's a weakness."" Nearly all Liberals told National Post that with the right team and more work, they believe Carney's economic credentials will more than make up for what he lacks in politics, even when it comes to facing off against Poilievre, whose team is partly banking on Carney's political inexperience to only help their fortunes as public opinion polls show the race to be tightening. However, some of Carney's supporters believe his resume is exactly what the Liberals needs to attract those who are thinking about voting for Poilievre. ""We need people who are sitting on the border, or who may have gone to leaning Conservative because they were angry with Trudeau to come back and to come to the Liberal side to look at something more centrist,"" said Donna Enwright from Haliburton, Ont., who became a Liberal party member to vote for Carney. ""And I think that's what Mark is. He's centre."" Iain Munro, who heads up the party's commission for seniors, said to appeal to more Canadians, Carney would be wise to sport a more laid-back tone, as he did in his unofficial campaign launch on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. ""He should be relaxed. I think he has a natural wit. I think he's funny. He needs to sort of just allow himself to be himself."" For others like Myrla Savet, who acknowledges she is a ""little bit"" worried about how Carney will fare on the campaign trail, she is banking on hope. ""Hopefully people will see that despite the fact that he does not have the political chops yet, that his expertise will carry him through.""

Poilievre accuses Carney of using Trump to 'distract'; Tories' long-held poll lead has narrowed,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre on Monday accused newly chosen Liberal Leader Mark Carney of trying to ""distract"" from how he spent his time before entering politics by focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump. Poilievre appeared before reporters to tell Canadians they should see Ono difference between outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the former central banker who will replace him. ""It's ironic,"" Poilievre said. ""Mr. Carney is trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest as well as his disastrous record as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser by talking about Trump."" Carney, who presented himself as a political outsider with deep economic experience, won the Liberal party leadership in a crushing first-ballot victory. He captured nearly 86 per cent of the vote. With the party unified behind him, Carney is expected to trigger an election before Parliament is set to resume on March 24. For weeks, public opinion polls have shown the yearand-a-half lead Poilievre has held over the Liberals to be narrowing as more Canadians are finding themselves increasingly consumed by Trump and his threat of tariffs and his repeated comments around annexation. The changing political landscape and Liberal surge have forced Poilievre to shift his message from affordability to why his party is best suited to steer Canada at a time when the U.S. has become an unreliable partner. ""Canadians have a choice in the next election,"" Poilievre said. Voters can choose to give Liberals a fourth term in power after they oversaw a historic rise in housing and food prices, Poilievre said. ""Or,"" he said, ""do they want 'Canada First' Conservatives who will axe taxes, build homes, unleash production of our resources and bring home paycheques, production and sovereignty to our country"" Poilievre has taken aim at Carney's record in business, noting how he has yet to disclose his assets and any potential conflicts of interest, which the new Liberal party leader said during the campaign that he would do as the rules require for public office holders. Given that Carney does not have a seat in the House of Commons, the ethics and conflict of interest rules covering elected officials did not apply to him during the leadership campaign. That prompted Poilievre to propose a way to close what he calls the ""Carney loophole"" by changing the rules so that leadership candidates must disclose their assets within 30 days of launching their campaigns. On Monday, Poilievre also pointed out that Carney has served as an adviser to Trudeau and in the past has endorsed climate change policies such as the consumer carbon tax. Carney has promised to scrap the unpopular consumer carbon tax and replace the quarterly cheques consumers receive with incentives to reduce their use and force industrial polluters to pay more. Even before Carney's victory, the Conservatives launched ads calling him ""sneaky"" and attacked him over his decision as chairman at Brookfield Assessment Management to endorse moving its headquarters to New York from Toronto. ""The Conservatives are resorting to the kind of dirty, personal politics that Mr. Poilievre has been known for since he was in cabinet with (former Conservative prime minister) Stephen Harper,"" Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Monday. ""That's unfortunate, but I actually think Canadians are not in that mood. Canadians are in a mood to rally around the flag, to rally around somebody who actually can stand up to Donald Trump."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Poilievre's tactics will only keep the party in opposition. ""Canadians are moving on from that,"" he told reporters. ""This is about our unity"" During the leadership campaign, Carney told reporters he was not involved in Brookfield's decision to move its headquarters to New York, but the Tories released a letter he sent to the company's shareholders that showed him encouraging them to approve the move. Carney later said he should have been more ""precise"" with his words. His campaign has also dismissed Poilievre's criticisms as exaggerated, saying it was only technical in nature and did not impact the company's Canadian operations. The company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

"Alberta's trucking industry faces a rocky road; Companies need help to offset effect of U.S. tariffs, Robert Harper writes",2025.0,"Donald Trump's erratic tariff threats have thrown the North American economy into turmoil. While the U.S. president recently backed down somewhat by exempting goods that fall under USMCA for a month, it's only a matter of time until he threatens the livelihoods of millions of Canadians with further measures. While his endgame is unclear, the potential damage to the Canadian economy is not. Take the commercial transportation sector, for instance. From raw materials to finished products ready for market, trucking keeps goods moving through supply chains. This contribution is immense. In 2022, Alberta's 18,000-plus fleets - some with one truck, others with hundreds - contributed over $3.5 billion to the province's GDP, says a Rocky Mountain Outlook piece, ""Trucking industry significant driver of Alberta's economy,"" published Nov. 2, 2023. Unfortunately, the industry is buckling under some significant challenges. Adding to the strain is something known as Driver Inc., an illegal practice whereby a few bad actors in the sector skirt federal taxes, harming workers' rights and undermining the ability of responsible players to compete because of federal government negligence despite the demonstrable harm this is inflicting on the industry. Needless to say, the threat of escalating tariffs from our largest trading partner couldn't come at a worse time. Seeing trouble on the horizon, the Alberta Motor Transport Association (AMTA) recently surveyed its members to assess the impact of potential trade tariffs and other regulatory challenges on the commercial transportation sector. The results were troubling, but not unexpected. A key takeaway from the survey was the significant financial pressure carriers are feeling with the tariff increase. The potential for increased operational costs, coupled with higher prices for equipment and parts, would force many companies to make difficult decisions about their future operations. What's more, a number of companies have already experienced the ripple effects of trade uncertainty, including renegotiated contracts with shippers due to fears over tariff-induced price hikes. The industry's delicate balance of cost and revenue is being pushed to its limits, and many companies are struggling to see a path forward. Alberta-based trucking companies are heavily reliant on cross-border trade, moving everything from agricultural products to oilfield equipment. According to the survey, many carriers are already seeing a decrease in cross-border traffic, with 21-40 per cent of respondents predicting further declines. In response to these challenges, companies are considering various strategies to stay afloat; passing higher costs on to customers, reducing fleet sizes, delaying equipment purchases, and even rolling back wages. These solutions are only temporary, and many companies fear they will not be enough to sustain fleets in the long run if trade disruptions persist. The need for proactive, strategic policy interventions is clear. Alberta's transportation sector has faced adversity before and now continues to face an increasingly unpredictable future. While there is nothing that will entirely shield the Canadian economy from across-the-board tariffs of 25 per cent (10 per cent on energy), respondents suggested steps that can help mitigate the damage, starting with trade policy adjustments to improve cross-border and interprovincial commerce. Governments also need to step in and implement immediate measures such as tariff exemptions to protect Alberta-based industries, provide fuel tax relief or incentives to help offset rising costs, and financial-assistance programs for companies directly affected by trade disruptions. Yes, these initiatives have a price tag, but the cost of inaction - entire fleets going under and disrupting supply chains - will be much higher. While the full extent of trade policy changes remains uncertain, the AMTA's survey results make one thing clear: Alberta's commercial transportation industry is facing a turbulent road ahead. Whether through proactive government action or industry-led initiatives, addressing both international and interprovincial trade barriers will be critical in ensuring long-term stability for the sector. Our future prosperity depends on us working together.

Carney said he stepped down as chairman of the company when he launched his campaign back in January. After one of the party's debates, he told reporters he was not involved in the firm's decision to move its headquarters from Toronto to New York - a move the Tories are hammering, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump wants to attract companies south of the border. Poilievre's office then released a letter showing that Carney told shareholders to vote in favour of the move, which they say is evidence Carney had lied to Canadians. Carney later acknowledged that he should have been more ""precise"" in his initial explanation. Longtime Liberal Bridget Girard pointed to the ads the Tories have already been running against Carney, labelling him as ""sneaky,"" as one of the challenges the new Liberal leader will face.

""We can understand, but I think it's a weakness."" Nearly all Liberals told National Post that with the right team and more work, they believe Carney's economic credentials will more than make up for what he lacks in politics, even when it comes to facing off against Poilievre, whose team is partly banking on Carney's political inexperience to only help their fortunes as public opinion polls show the race to be tightening. However, some of Carney's supporters believe his resume is exactly what the Liberals needs to attract those who are thinking about voting for Poilievre. ""We need people who are sitting on the border, or who may have gone to leaning Conservative because they were angry with Trudeau to come back and to come to the Liberal side to look at something more centrist,"" said Donna Enwright from Haliburton, Ont., who became a Liberal party member to vote for Carney.

Poilievre owns 'grating' style in new Quebec ads; Charm Offensive,2025.0,"OTTAWA . A new French language advertisement starring Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre begins uncharacteristically for a campaign ad, with Poilievre offering an admission that his style of politics can seem brusque at times, especially to Quebecers. ""Some people think my style is too direct, too blunt,"" says Poilievre, leaning on a desk and smiling. The party and Poilievre want to explain his style to Quebec voters, according to sources who spoke on background. The Conservative party launched its biggest radio, TV and online ad campaign to date in Quebec to show how approachable he is, how funny he can be and why he does politics the way he does. Poilievre's office did not comment on this story. ""I wonder, should we be cute and docile when negotiating tariffs with Donald Trump? Let's take back control and put Canada first,"" says Poilievre in one of the three versions of the ad. Alain Rayes, the former Quebec lieutenant to Conservative leaders Andrew Scheer and Erin O' Toole, who is now an independent MP, saw the ad over the weekend where the relaxed Poilievre tries to explain himself to Quebecers. ""I think he will convince people,"" he said. ""When you meet him, he is very friendly. I still believe he is an extremely smart politician. But he uses techniques that I disapprove of,"" he added. Rayes knows a thing or two about Poilievre's style. He was attacked by the party in an automated text message sent out to party members in his riding of Richmond-Arthabaska days after Poilievre was elected leader in 2022. At the time, Rayes had just led Jean Charest's failed leadership campaign and had left the Conservative caucus because his ""political ideals, values and convictions (were) not compatible"" with those of Poilievre. The attack implied that Rayes had quit the Conservative party because he ""decided not to fight (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau's inflation with Pierre Poilievre's united team."" The party then apologized. ""There is kind of a moral endorsement by the tone that Pierre Poilievre uses. So, these people were reassured with the overwhelming victory they had during the leadership race. They felt that they had the right strategy and tone,"" said Rayes in an interview with the National Post. Rayes is just one example of Poilievre's targets. The leader gives his opponents nicknames. He has called the mayors of Montreal and Quebec City ""incompetent"" and has argued for months that the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party of Canada are in a coalition, when they are not. ""In Quebec, the Republican-style politics doesn't jive,"" said a Conservative source. But Poilievre wants to win in Quebec, sources tell us. In fact, he may even need Quebec, especially with the Liberals surging in the polls. With 10 seats, the Conservatives are hoping to boost their fortunes in the next election by flipping Bloc seats in Centre-du-Québec, Quebec City and SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. Eric Blais, the president of Headspace Marketing, who has worked for more than 40 years in marketing and communications in English and French Canada, said he was surprised by Poilievre's apparent admission that he has a ""grating sort of style"", a style that isn't exactly ""endearing with many Quebecers."" ""So he's trying to address the elephant in the room, but I don't think he is, because to then pivot and suggest that that very style is what's needed to fight Trump ... 'I'm the right guy, because I have a style that is, that can be disruptive, that can be grating', I'm not so sure Quebecers are going to buy that,"" said Blais. According to him, Poilievre still has a ""Je ne sais quoi"", something that just doesn't land with this electorate. ""These videos confirm that he knows it. Though it might be a strength to fight Trump, this admission will not make him more sympathetic in the minds of Quebec voters,"" he suggested. Sources close to him would not say whether Poilievre intends to change his style. ""He's himself and he speaks for himself,"" one of them said. So, what is the offer to Quebecers? In his Canada first rally, Poilievre mentioned La Belle Province a few times in his hour-long speech, but did not propose anything specific for Quebecers. ""Our heritage and citizenship departments will have an official policy of promoting our common national identity. The goal is not to erase our differences but to bridge them,"" he said. He also focused on national symbols like Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister, who is still a divisive figure in Quebec. And Terry Fox, a national hero he wants to see on Canadians' passports. In fact, the Liberals took issue with many of the things he said in his speech. ""Where has Pierre been? He is late to the game. A new slogan does not change the fact he has always put Canada second after his own interest and career,"" said Guillaume Bertrand, who was the Liberal Quebec lieutenant Jean-Yves Duclos's spokesperson at the time. In a recent press conference, Poilievre's Quebec Lieutenant Pierre Paul-Hus said the party will elaborate on its offer to Quebecers during the next campaign. ""What we recognize is that Quebec is a nation that has different issues that must be addressed in a particular way in Quebec. So, in the details we will go further in time and place,"" he said. In 2019 and 2021, Rayes convinced the party to launch a platform solely for Quebec, to recognize the ""distinct society"" and to convince the nationalists to move away from the Bloc Québécois. It didn't work, and in another move that hopes to change Conservative fortunes in Quebec, Poilievre will not present such a platform this time.

Poilievre accuses Carney of using Trump to 'distract'; Tories' long-held poll lead has narrowed,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre on Monday accused newly chosen Liberal Leader Mark Carney of trying to ""distract"" from how he spent his time before entering politics by focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump. Poilievre appeared before reporters to tell Canadians they should see Ono difference between outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the former central banker who will replace him. ""It's ironic,"" Poilievre said. ""Mr. Carney is trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest as well as his disastrous record as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser by talking about Trump."" Carney, who presented himself as a political outsider with deep economic experience, won the Liberal party leadership in a crushing first-ballot victory. He captured nearly 86 per cent of the vote. With the party unified behind him, Carney is expected to trigger an election before Parliament is set to resume on March 24. For weeks, public opinion polls have shown the yearand-a-half lead Poilievre has held over the Liberals to be narrowing as more Canadians are finding themselves increasingly consumed by Trump and his threat of tariffs and his repeated comments around annexation. The changing political landscape and Liberal surge have forced Poilievre to shift his message from affordability to why his party is best suited to steer Canada at a time when the U.S. has become an unreliable partner. ""Canadians have a choice in the next election,"" Poilievre said. Voters can choose to give Liberals a fourth term in power after they oversaw a historic rise in housing and food prices, Poilievre said. ""Or,"" he said, ""do they want 'Canada First' Conservatives who will axe taxes, build homes, unleash production of our resources and bring home paycheques, production and sovereignty to our countrv"" Poilievre has taken aim at Carney's record in business, noting how he has yet to disclose his assets and any potential conflicts of interest, which the new Liberal party leader said during the campaign that he would do as the rules require for public office holders. Given that Carney does not have a seat in the House of Commons, the ethics and conflict of interest rules covering elected officials did not apply to him during the leadership campaign. That prompted Poilievre to propose a way to close what he calls the ""Carney loophole"" by changing the rules so that leadership candidates must disclose their assets within 30 days of launching their campaigns. On Monday, Poilievre also pointed out that Carney has served as an adviser to Trudeau and in the past has en-dorsed climate change policies such as the consumer carbon tax. Carney has promised to scrap the unpopular consumer carbon tax and replace the quarterly cheques consumers receive with incentives to reduce their use and force industrial polluters to pay more. Even before Carney's victory, the Conservatives launched ads calling him ""sneaky"" and attacked him over his decision as chairman at Brookfield Assessment Management to endorse moving its headquarters to New York from Toronto. ""The Conservatives are resorting to the kind of dirty, personal politics that Mr. Poilievre has been known for since he was in cabinet with (former Conservative prime minister) Stephen Harper,"" Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Monday. ""That's unfortunate, but I actually think Canadians are not in that mood. Canadians are in a mood to rally around the flag, to rally around somebody who actually can stand up to Donald Trump."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Poilievre's tactics will only keep the party in opposition. ""Canadians are moving on from that,"" he told reporters. ""This is about our unity."" During the leadership campaign, Carney told reporters he was not involved in Brookfield's decision to move its headquarters to New York, but the Tories released a letter he sent to the company's shareholders that showed him encouraging them to approve the move. Carney later said he should have been more ""precise"" with his words. His campaign has also dismissed Poilievre's criticisms as exaggerated, saying it was only technical in nature and did not impact the company's Canadian operations. The company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Poilievre accuses Carney of using Trump to 'distract'; Tories' long-held poll lead has narrowed,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre on Monday accused newly chosen Liberal Leader Mark Carney of trying to ""distract"" from how he spent his time before entering politics by focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump. Poilievre appeared before reporters to tell Canadians they should see no difference between outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the former central banker who will replace him. ""It's ironic,"" Poilievre said. ""Mr. Carney is trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest as well as his disastrous record as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser by talking about Trump."" Carney, who presented himself as a political outsider with deep economic experience, won the Liberal party leadership in a crushing first-ballot victory. He captured nearly 86 per cent of the vote. With the party unified behind him, Carney is expected to trigger an election before Parliament is set to resume on March 24. For weeks, public opinion polls have shown the yearand-a-half lead Poilievre has held over the Liberals to be narrowing as more Canadians are finding themselves increasingly consumed by Trump and his threat of tariffs and his repeated comments around annexation. The changing political landscape and Liberal surge have forced Poilievre to shift his message from affordability to why his party is best suited to steer Canada at a time when the U.S. has become an unreliable partner. ""Canadians have a choice in the next election,"" Poilievre said. Voters can choose to give Liberals a fourth term in power after they oversaw a historic rise in housing and food prices, Poilievre said. ""Or,"" he said, ""do they want 'Canada First' Conservatives who will axe taxes, build homes, unleash production of our resources and bring home paycheques, production and sovereignty to our country."" Poilievre has taken aim at Carney's record in business, noting how he has yet to disclose his assets and any potential conflicts of interest, which the new Liberal party leader said during the campaign that he would do as the rules require for public office holders. Given that Carney does not have a seat in the House of Commons, the ethics and conflict of interest rules COvering elected officials did not apply to him during the leadership campaign. That prompted Poilievre to propose a way to close what he calls the ""Carney loophole"" by changing the rules so that leadership candidates must disclose their assets within 30 days of launching their campaigns. On Monday, Poilievre also pointed out that Carney has served as an adviser to Trudeau and in the past has endorsed climate change policies such as the consumer carbon tax. Carney has promised to scrap the unpopular consumer carbon tax and replace the quarterly cheques consumers receive with incentives to reduce their use and force industrial polluters to pay more. Even before Carney's victory, the Conservatives launched ads calling him ""sneaky"" and attacked him over his decision as chairman at Brookfield Assessment Management to endorse moving its headquarters to New York from Toronto. ""The Conservatives are resorting to the kind of dirty, personal politics that Mr. Poilievre has been known for since he was in cabinet with (former Conservative prime minister) Stephen Harper,"" Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Monday. ""That's unfortunate, but I actually think Canadians are not in that mood. Canadians are in a mood to rally around the flag, to rally around somebody who actually can stand up to Donald Trump."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Poilievre's tactics will only keep the party in opposition. ""Canadians are moving on from that,"" he told reporters. ""This is about our unity."" During the leadership campaign, Carney told reporters he was not involved in Brookfield's decision to move its headquarters to New York, but the Tories released a letter he sent to the company's shareholders that showed him encouraging them to approve the move. Carney later said he should have been more ""precise"" with his words. His campaign has also dismissed Poilievre's criticisms as exaggerated, saying it was only technical in nature and did not impact the company's Canadian operations. The company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

""We need people who are sitting on the border, or who may have gone to leaning Conservative because they were angry with Trudeau to come back and to come to the Liberal side to look at something more centrist,"" said Donna Enwright from Haliburton, Ont., who became a Liberal party member to vote for Carney. ""And I think that's what Mark is. He's centre."" Iain Munro, who heads up the party's commission for seniors, said to appeal to more Canadians, Carney would be wise to sport a more laid back tone, as he did in his unofficial campaign launch on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. ""He should be relaxed. I think he has a natural whit. I think he's funny. He needs to sort of just allow himself to be himself."" For others like Myrla Savet, who acknowledges she is a ""little bit"" worried about how Carney will fare on the campaign trail, she is banking on hope. ""Hopefully people will see that despite the fact that he does not have the political chops yet, that his expertise will carry him through.""","Kingston Whig - Standard; Kingston, Ont.","Kingston, Ont.","Taylor, Stephanie",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 11, 2025",Canada-US relations; Political campaigns; Politics; Elections,Nom: National Post; NAICS: 513110,2025-03-11,Kingston Whig - Standard
Poilievre accuses Carney of using Trump to 'distract'; Tories' long-held poll lead has narrowed,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre on Monday acc used newly chosen Liberal Leader Mark Carney of trying to ""distract"" from how he spent his time before entering politics by focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump. Poilievre appeared before reporters to tell Canadians they should see no difference between outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the former central banker who will replace him. ""It's ironic,"" Poilievre said. ""Mr. Carney is trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest as well as his disastrous record as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser by talking about Trump."" Carney, who presented himself as a political outsider with deep economic experience, won the Liberal party leadership in a crushing first-ballot victory. He captured nearly 86 per cent of the vote. With the party unified be- hind him, Carney is expected to trigger an election before Parliament is set to resume on March 24. For weeks, public opinion polls have shown the yearand-a-half lead Poilievre has held over the Liberals to be narrowing as more Canadians are finding themselves increasingly consumed by Trump and his threat of tariffs and his repeated comments around annexation. The changing political landscape and Liberal surge have forced Poilievre to shift his message from affordability to why his party is best suited to steer Canada at a time when the U.S. has become an unreliable partner. ""Canadians have a choice in the next election,"" Poilievre said. Voters can choose to give Liberals a fourth term in power after they oversaw a historic rise in housing and food prices, Poilievre said. ""Or,"" he said, ""do they want 'Canada First' Conservatives who will axe taxes, build homes, unleash production of our resources and bring home paycheques, production and sovereignty to our country."" Poilievre has taken aim at Carney's record in business, noting how he has yet to dis- close his assets and any potential conflicts of interest, which the new Liberal party leader said during the campaign that he would do as the rules require for public office holders. Given that Carney does not have a seat in the House of Commons, the ethics and conflict of interest rules covering elected officials did not apply to him during the leadership campaign. That prompted Poilievre to propose a way to close what he calls the ""Carney loophole"" by changing the rules so that leadership candidates must disclose their assets within 30 days of launching their campaigns. On Monday, Poilievre also pointed out that Carney has served as an adviser to Trudeau and in the past has endorsed climate change policies such as the consumer carbon tax. Carney has promised to scrap the unpopular consumer carbon tax and replace the quarterly cheques consumers receive with incentives to reduce their use and force industrial polluters to pay more. Even before Carne y 's victory, the Conservatives launched ads calling him ""sneaky"" and attacked him over his decision as chairman at Brookfield Assess- ment Management to endorse moving its headquarters to New York from Toronto. ""The Conservatives are resorting to the kind of dirty, personal politics that Mr. Poilievre has been known for since he was in cabinet with (former Conservative prime minister) Stephen Harper,"" Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Monday. ""That's unfortunate, but I actually think Canadians are not in that mood. Canadians are in a mood to rally around the flag, to rally around somebody who actually can stand up to Donald Trump."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Poilievre's tactics will only keep the party in opposition. ""Canadians are moving on from that,"" he told reporters. ""This is about our unity."" During the leadership campaign, Carney told reporters he was not involved in Brookfield's decision to move its headquarters to New York, but the Tories released a letter he sent to the company's shareholders that showed him encouraging them to approve the move. Carne y later said he should have been more ""precise"" with his words. His campaign has also dismissed Poilievre's criticisms as exaggerated, saying it was only technical in nature and did not impact the company's Canadian operations. The company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

I've had heart surgery. Thanks to numerous cardiology specialists, I still canoe, hike and ride my bike. I've worked at my fitness; it's a matter of quality of life. Recently, I had my first vertigo attack. When the walls stood still, I called a taxi and rode to St. Joseph's emergency department, my nearest hospital. I needed to know if I was having a stroke. It was a little after 6 p.m. It took 40 minutes to get to admitting. The triage nurse took my blood pressure, had me make a fake smile, raise my arms and push against her hands. Then she smiled - a real smile. That smile was the best news I could have had. She didn't have to smile; she did it out of kindness, out of compassion. At that moment, I knew I was going to be OK. I was sent to a waiting room with more than 40 people. Two hours later, it was my turn. By 10:30 p.m., I had been seen by three nurses, had my blood pressure taken twice, had a blood test and the results back, was hooked up to an ECG and seen by a neurologist twice. No stroke. It was an ""inner ear crystals"" problem. Who knew? I was treated with the utmost care by very competent people at St. Joseph's Health Centre. But there were not enough of them. Premier Doug Ford, you need to fix this or seniors will be dropping while they wait for treatment. Until then, we should be sending flowers every day to the front-line workers in our public health system. This letter is my bouquet. Andy Hanson, Toronto Tories' Harper move backfiring Former PM Harper blasts Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney's economic record, March 3 Conservatives cannot resist overstating their case. They should have kept the focus of their attacks against Mark Carney on the Brookfield story. By pulling former prime minister Stephen Harper into it, they have created fertile ground for the Liberals to say that Harper was actively trying to recruit Carney as finance minister in 2012, something Harper has never denied. If Carney is exaggerating his well-documented accomplishments in helping Canada emerge from the 2008 worldwide financial crisis in both better shape and earlier than any other G7 economy, as per Harper's recent claim, then why did Harper not only want Carney to succeed the late Jim Flaherty as finance minister, but also originally appoint Carney to head the Bank of Canada? Julianne Vance, Markham Stiles rewarded for her dogged determination We pollsters missed something big in the Ontario election. The federal Liberals should pay attention, March 6 Not only was NDP Leader Marit Stiles an incumbent, but she also earned her credentials for years fighting back against Premier Doug Ford. Her dogged determination to challenge his policies reveals her integrity and sincerity. She is always smiling and seems genuinely to want to help people. I'm glad voters rewarded her. Diane Sullivan, Toronto The mercury is still in the river in Grassy Narrows After years of waiting, Grassy Narrows breaks ground on a care home to treat victims of mercury poisoning, March 5 So, construction of the Grassy Narrows Mercury Poisoning Treatment Centre is finally underway. First announced in 2017, it has been touted by Indigenous Services ministers Carolyn Bennett, Seamus O'Regan, Mark Miller and Patty Hajdu. If completed as scheduled in 2027, residents of Grassy and nearby Whitedog will have been going to Thunder Bay for treatment for more than 10 years since it was announced, rather than be able to die close to their families at home. Meanwhile, the mercury is still in the river (and the fish), more than 50 years later. So much for being ""there for the community as they continue to grow and heal."" Greg McMaster, Edmonton We must hit U.S. consumers in their wallets U.S. President Donald Trump provided a detailed blueprint for exactly how to combat the tariffs he has imposed. Trump made a promise to cut inflation, so we need to hit consumer's in their wallets. Every tariff reduction, exemption or carve out is an opportunity for Canada to hit back where it will hurt him the most. We need export tariffs on oil and gas, potash and fertilizer and auto parts, and any future exemptions or carve outs. We need to target the trade sectors where he has shown weakness. Premier Doug Ford is already onside by rejecting Trump's proposal for a 30-day pause on the auto parts tariffs. Alberta and Saskatchewan are already writeoffs for the Liberals, so who cares if Danielle Smith and Scott Moe complain. This tariff fight is about Canada as a whole, not individual provinces. We must use every tool available. Clyde McDonald, Bracebridge, Ont. Taking American products off shelves a bad idea Jack Daniel's maker says LCBO pulling its booze off the shelves in response to Trump's trade war is 'worse than the tariff,' March 6 Taking American products off our shelves will simply force U.S. President Donald Trump to take Canadian products of their shelves. It ups the ante and can only result in anti-Canadian reaction from Americans and a similar response from Trump. Support ""buy Canadian"" by all means but taking American products off our shelves denies us choice. Jack Gallop, Thornhill, Ont. Canada would rule the U.S. If U.S. President Donald Trump and Congress manage to absorb Canada by annexation, Canada would suddenly be the largest, most powerful and wealthiest state in the U.S., via our educated voting population, land mass, raw goods, minerals and oil. We could then team up with previously annexed western and eastern coast states, present a Canadian nominee for the next presidential election and woo the opposition with promises of secret fishing and hunting spots, Canadian rye and free maple syrup. Once the Canadian candidate wins the election - by a landslide - we change the name to United States of Canada. It will be the greatest peaceful takeover the world will ever witness.

"Ottawa's old spending habits leave poilievre, Smith wary; Alberta would have to fight for any cash collected as export tax on oil and gas",2025.0,"Canada's political leaders are standing as one against the threat of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which were once again partly delayed by Trump, this time until April 2. There's broad bipartisan agreement - from Liberals Justin Trudeau and Mark Carney to Conservative Pierre Poilievre, from the UCP's Danielle Smith to the NDP's Naheed Nenshi - on most big issues. That includes the necessity of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and the benefits of axing more interprovincial trade barriers. But on one key issue - the negotiation tactics around a possible export tax on Alberta oil and on what to do with potential tariff revenues - there's major disagreement. Poilievre and Smith are wary of the federal government's well-known capacity to grab and waste money. While Trudeau and Nenshi focus on the need to provide government payments to support workers and industries hit hard by tariffs, Poilievre's primary plan would be to help all Canadians with a tax cut. ""Counter tariffs must not be a cash cow for the government,"" he said this week. ""Almost every penny of these collected should go to tax cuts with a small sum set aside for targeted relief to workers hardest hit by the trade war. None of the money should go to new government spending and programs. We must not allow politicians to dishonestly use this crisis to once again launch a debt-fuelled, money-printing spending spree."" As for Carney, his policy on this matter sounds much like what Poilievre would do, taking tariff proceeds and having them go directly to workers most affected by tariffs but also promising a middle-class tax cut. The major area of disagreement is around what might happen if Trump carves out Canadian energy from his general tariff plan. Trump already did so in his initial threat, calling for a 10 per cent tariff on energy and a 25 per cent tariff on all other Canadian goods. In federal Liberal circles, there's been much musing about Ottawa rejecting any carve-out on energy, essentially replacing any U.S. tariff reduction with a Canadian export tax on our oil and gas, with Ottawa driving up U.S. costs while collecting billions. But Trudeau has now joined with Smith in rejecting such an export tax. Asked how Canada should respond if Trump carved out oil and gas, Trudeau again on Thursday gave an Alberta-friendly response. ""Any carve-outs that support any workers in Canada, even if it's just one industry or another, are going to be a good thing."" He added: ""The unity that Canadians are feeling right now is actually the most important thing in being able to stand up against a trading partner that is much bigger than us but is facing real internal debates and divisions on the impacts of these unjustified tariffs."" If some Canadian industries get a carve out, it will mean they will still be strong and not need federal financial assistance, Trudeau said, thus enabling funds to be directed at workers and industries hardest hit. For months, Smith has forcefully rejected such an export tax on oil and gas. Could it be she got through to Trudeau? Or maybe Trudeau has at last decided to govern for all of us. Or maybe he simply doesn't need to hammer Alberta any longer to win votes in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. For their part, Carney and Nenshi are less clear about an export tax on Alberta oil and gas. They refused to rule out the scheme this week. ""When you have cards in negotiations you don't offer them up. We should never take things off the table, but we should work collaboratively,"" Carney said. Should we buy Carney's position? Why would we? Aren't a number of options, in fact, easy for federal politicians to rule out? For example, would not Carney rule out doing anything that might harm the Quebec dairy cartel? Surely anything that might harm Ontario's auto sector is also sacrosanct? Why not do the same for Alberta's oil and gas? Nenshi essentially agreed with Carney on this matter, saying we have to use our ""best tools"" against the U.S. ""That means taking nothing off the table. That means showing our teeth when we need to show our teeth."" Nenshi makes a reasonable point about the art of negotiation but, on the matter of an oil and gas export tax, Alberta would be negotiating against Ottawa, not Trump. We would have to fight to get all revenue from such a tax to bail out Alberta, as opposed to flowing it to Ottawa. Should such a day ever come, I'll suggest the hardline position adopted by Smith is the best tool to get Alberta a win. dstaples@postmedia.com","Edmonton Journal; Edmonton, Alta.","Edmonton, Alta.","Staples, David",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 7, 2025",Canada-US relations; Export taxes; Tax cuts; Politics; Tariffs,,2025-03-07,Edmonton Journal

Interim PC leader has 'conversation' with MLA about Holocaust comment,2025.0,"The interim leader of New Brunswick's Progressive Conservatives says he's had a ""conversation"" with his party member who recently referenced the Holocaust in defence of a controversial social media post she made last fall. Albert-Riverview MLA Sherry Wilson recently spoke to Brunswick News about her residential school post that drew calls from some Indigenous leaders for her to be removed as a PC candidate in the fall provincial election. In that post, Wilson appeared to draw a link between protections for LGBTQ+ students under the province's original gender-identity policy and the federal system aimed at stripping Indigenous children of their language and culture through residential schools. Last month, Wilson told Brunswick News that it wasn't her intention to draw a comparison between the original Policy 713 and residential schools, and that the media misconstrued her social media post. Instead, she offered an explanation as to why she decided to make a public call on the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to make sure history doesn't repeat itself. ""The intention of it was because when you go to the Holocaust memorials, that's one of the things they'll always say, 'Let's talk about it, so it never happens again,'"" she said. Green party Deputy Leader Megan Mitton blasted Wilson for referencing the Holocaust when ""residential schools already should not have been brought into this discussion"" on Policy 713. In her social media post, Wilson pledged to keep parents involved in their children's development ""while entrusted to our government schools,"" suggesting the residential school system ""was only allowed to happen because children enrolled in school were isolated from their parents' oversight, input and influence."" Last week, interim PC Leader Glen Savoie wouldn't say if he agreed or disagreed with Wilson's reference to the Holocaust, but said he had a ""conversation"" with the MLA. ""We always discuss how we can do things better and certainly that was the point of our discussion, how we can be better when we're dealing with the media,"" Savoie said last Thursday. When pressed for his thoughts on her remarks, Savoie said, ""I'll just repeat that we had a conversation about it."" ""I'll certainly talk to my staff today about how I can do better with the comments I made today, so it's always about continuous improvement and making sure that we're doing the best we can to get our message out to New Brunswickers,"" he added. Savoie wouldn't say whether or not Wilson was facing any disciplinary action from the party over her remarks. Brunswick News requested an interview with Wilson through the party and did not receive a response Friday. ""I can't really speak for the leader of the opposition on how to handle the situation, but I think it needs to be taken much more seriously,"" Government Caucus Leader Natacha Vautour said Friday. ""To me, there's no comparison to be made between Policy 713 and two major tragedies that were really rooted in discrimination and hatred."" In a statement Friday, Mitton accused Savoie of ""missing the point."" ""It was such a ridiculous and harmful statement, I can't believe we are even talking about it,"" Mitton said. ""Given what's happening in Trump's USA and in many other countries, we do not live in a world where trans and non-binary rights are respected, so we must be vigilant to protect these human rights."" In 2023, the former Higgs PC government put in place a new parental consent requirement for trans and non-binary public-school students under the age of 16. School staff were required to obtain parental consent to informally use these students' chosen names and pronouns at school. The new requirement was championed by then premier Blaine Higgs and education minister Bill Hogan, both of whom spoke about their concerns with schools keeping secrets from parents under their government's original version of Policy 713. On the campaign trail last fall, Higgs decided to keep Wilson on as a candidate after her residential school post was condemned by Indigenous leaders, the Liberals and the Greens. However, the post was eventually taken down because ""it didn't meet the mark and it was interpreted differently,"" Higgs later told reporters. After a landside win for the Liberals in the fall election, the new Holt government revised Policy 713, returning the right of all students - regardless of age or gender identity - to informally go by their chosen names and pronouns at school without parental consent.

Former PM Harper takes aim at Carney's record; Flaherty made the 'hard calls' in financial crisis,2025.0,"Former prime minister Stephen Harper is taking shots at Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney's economic record days before the party gathers to choose its next leader. In his bid to win the Liberal leadership, Carney has campaigned on his economic record as governor of both the Bank of Canada and later the Bank of England. His campaign website says Carney ""guided Canada through one of the most turbulent economic periods in modern history, protecting jobs and helping ensure that Canada came out stronger."" In a Conservative party fundraising email released Monday, Harper accused Carney of taking unearned credit for steering the Canadian economy out of the global financial crisis more than 15 years ago. While Harper appointed Carney to run the Bank of Canada at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, he said in the email that it was then-finance minister Jim Flaherty who made the ""hard calls."" ""Carney's experience is NOT the day-to-day management of Canada's economy during the global financial crisis,"" wrote Harper. ""I have listened, with increasing disbelief, to Mark Carney's attempts to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with back then. He has been doing this at the expense of the late Jim Flaherty, among the greatest Finance Ministers in Canada's history, who sadly is not here to defend his record. But let me be very clear: the hard calls during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis were made by Jim,"" he wrote. He went on to argue that Carney has been ""wrong on all the big issues."" ""Instead of tapping into our potential, the Liberals under Justin Trudeau, with the advice of Mark Carney, have doubled the debt, doubled housing costs, and doubled food bank lineups,"" Harper wrote. In a statement issued to The Canadian Press, a spokesperson for Carney's campaign claimed that Harper's attack was an attempt to salvage Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's electoral chances in the federal election widely expected to follow the Liberal leadership campaign. ""In 2025, Mr. Harper is being called on to save Pierre Poilievre from a historic drop in support, but no amount of revisionist history can take away from Mr. Carney's proven record of economic leadership,"" said Carney's campaign in an email. Conservatives spent the last week attacking Carney for being ""sneaky,"" inflating his resumé and having ""sold out Canada"" by overseeing the move of Canadian investment house Brookfield's head office to the United States. On Friday, National Post reported that Carney had not yet resigned from his multiple international board positions, despite claiming that he had stepped down from all his roles to be ""all in"" on his bid to become prime minister. Harper's recent comments about Carney are very different from the praise he offered in 2012, when Carney was leaving the central bank to take on the top job at the Bank of England. In a media statement issued at the time, Harper said Carney did an ""admirable job"" of fulfilling the Bank of Canada's mandate through a period of economic uncertainty and was a ""valued partner"" in the government's efforts to stabilize the economy after the recession. Flaherty, who died in 2014, is also on the record praising Carney's work. Chisholm Pothier, Flaherty's director of communications during the financial crisis, said in a post on the social media platform X that while Flaherty and Harper provided political leadership, Carney played a ""big role"" in responding to the crisis through monetary policy. When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2008 and banks around the world faced imminent collapse, Carney was only a few months into his tenure as governor of the Bank of Canada. He dropped interest rates to historic lows for the time and took steps to ensure Canadian banks had enough liquidity to maintain their operations. A variety of commentators at the time praised Carney's actions, which - along with actions taken by the Harper government and the tightly regulated Canadian financial system - were credited with helping to protect Canada from the worst of the global financial crisis. Harper's attack comes as Liberal members have begun voting on a new leader to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the winner of the leadership race will be announced on March 9.

Harper says Carney is taking credit for 'things he had little or nothing to do with',2025.0,"Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is trying ""to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with,"" wrote former prime minister Stephen Harper in a new letter to Conservative party members.

""I have listened, with increasing disbelief, to Mark Carney's attempts to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with back then.

Trump slams Poilievre as 'not a MAGA guy'; U.K. Interview,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's biggest problem is that he's ""not a MAGA guy,"" according to U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump told British news magazine The Spectator that he wasn't pleased with Poilievre's recent jabs in a wide-ranging interview published on Friday. ""I don't like what he's say - ing about me. It's just not positive about me,"" Trump said to interviewer Ben Domenech. Trump warned that Poilievre was making a ""big mistake"" by ratcheting up the tough talk and was likely to join a long list of leaders who've tried and failed to outmuscle him. ""They think they're going to be the tough guy and they're going to knock out Trump, and they end up getting the hell beat out of 'em,"" said Trump. ""They all make that mistake."" Poilievre has had to walk a fine line on Trump with polls showing the Republican president is popular with a segment of the Conservative base. The Conservative leader didn't immediately respond to Trump's comments, but Conservative MP Michael Barrett was quick to shrug them off. ""We're laser focused on what's best for Canadians, we're not worried about comments of people in other countries,"" Barrett told reporters at a media scrum in Ottawa on Friday. Poilievre has shifted to a more combative tone as part of a ""Canada First"" rebrand, partly in response to Trump's tariff and annexation threats, which have spurred a rebound in the governing Liberals' polling numbers.

PC incumbent Jones romps to easy win; Chatham-Kent-Leamington,2025.0,"Progressive Conservative Trevor Jones cruised to re-election in Chatham-Kent-Leamington as part of the Tory wave that won a third majority in Thursday's Ontario election. The polls had barely closed before Jones was declared the winner after quickly leading by thousands of votes. He finished with 22,250 votes, or 52 per cent, topping the 17,522 he polled in 2022. ""It's an absolute privilege. I'm so humbled,"" Jones said. ""It's such a tight schedule. We worked hard every day through the cold. ""Hard work pays off,"" he added. ""In every corner of our riding, (we) talked to thousands and thousands of people (and) heard their concerns."" Jones faced mostly unknown candidates from outside the riding, including Liberal Bill Kirby (7,856 votes, 18.4 per cent), New Democrat Christian Sachs (7,333, 17.1 per cent), the Green Party's Matthew Davey (1,241, 2.9 per cent) and Ontario Party candidate Phillip St-Laurent (704, 1.6 per cent). The lone challenger from the 2022 election was New Blue Party candidate Rhonda Jubenville, a Chatham-Kent councillor. She finished fourth with 3,387 votes, or 7.9 per cent. ""Obviously, we're disappointed that we didn't win, but it's always hard to unseat an incumbent,"" Kirby said. Sachs was optimistic, but also ""a realist,"" she said. ""The reality is this has been a Conservative riding,"" she added. The Tories campaigned heavily on defending Ontario from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and Jones said it was a top issue with local voters. ""There's a genuine fear for jobs. And people's children's jobs,"" he said. ""It was like, 'What's going to happen to our economy?' "" Agribusiness and the automotive sector are particularly at risk in the riding, Jones said. One constituent told him if tariffs go through, 500 employees at his company would be out of work in 30 days. Jones said, rising to 900 employees in 90 days.

"No answers yet on power bills: ceo; Lori Clark pleads for patience, more time to complete audit",2025.0,"Politicians of all stripes expressed frustration with NB Power on Thursday after the utility's CEO said a preliminary investigation into high household electricity bills found nothing out of the ordinary. Lori Clark told the public accounts committee at the legislature that the utility was still committed to finding answers and pleaded for more time - until April - for an independent investigation by accounting firm KPMG to wrap up. She said NB Power's call cen- tre had been flooded with more than 1,000 complaints about their high December bills and admitted that was likely only the tip of the iceberg, as many customers don't bother phoning in. ""I feel the frustration myself,"" she told the politicians, who have been similarly bombarded with public complaints from across the province about metering and billing accuracy. ""I want to get answers to New Brunswickers. I understand that high bills are a challenge to New Brunswick customers today and I want to do what we can to help. But I think it's critical that we have thorough information, that we're being fully transparent with New Brunswickers."" So far, NB Power has found nothing beyond what it already told people when the bills began to roll out. It is blaming December's cold spell, a longer billing cycle and higher rates for the price spike. Clark said she wanted to emphasize that ""if any issues are found, we will take immediate action, and that includes offering refunds to customers where necessary."" Following a public outcry, the provincial government ordered NB Power last month to have the review ready for Thursday. The CEO apologized at the session for not telling the politicians sooner that more time was needed. KPMG, it turns out, originally said it needed three months, given the scope of work involved. So far, the accounting firm has only looked at 40 meters - 20 of the new smart meters and 20 of the old meters - at households that had extraordinarily high bills. It wants a larger sample size, given that there are about 400,000 households with NB Power meters that gauge the amount of electricity used. ""There is simply more work to be done,"" Clark said. ""Over the past few weeks, we've undertaken significant work on this independent assessment. However, as information began to flow in, it led to additional questions and growing scope that required further investigation to fully understand the concerns that our customers have."" She said sorry to the politicians for only telling them the day before that the report wouldn't be ready. That wasn't good enough for Glen Savoie, the leader of the Official Opposition and the interim leader of the Progressive Conservatives, who asked pointed questions. ""You did mention in your comments this is about trust and confidence,"" he said. ""This is also about value for money and to make sure people are getting the best service for what they pay for."" With little in the way of answers, Savoie eventually shifted gears, opening up a report by the auditor general from 2024. The auditor general had recommended in 2020 that NB Power prioritize debt reduction by developing a firm and well-defined debt management plan. NB Power has $5.3 billion in debt, built up over the years as it revamped power plants and put up new transmission lines and other infrastructure. In a follow-up report, the auditor general noted that four years later, NB Power was the only Crown corporation or government department that had fulfilled zero of the office's recommendations. ""You've achieved nothing on those,"" Savoie said. ""Why are you not achieving any headway? Because people are feeling the impact on their bills. There are only two ways to do it. ""You cut your costs, or you increase people's power rates, which you have already done."" Clark pushed back, especially when Savoie mentioned he might dig deeper on NB Power bonuses for executives. She said there was no truth that anyone at NB Power received bonuses for their work. And while she admitted savings could be found at NB Power, she said it would more likely be in the tens of millions, not $1 billion needed in debt reduction. Such drastic cuts, she warned, would compromise the safety and reliability of the electrical system. Darren Murphy, the vice president and chief financial officer of NB Power, also weighed in, saying he didn't see eye to eye with the auditor general, arguing the Crown corporation had filed detailed plans on debt reduction to the provincial regulator, even if it hadn't succeeded at cleaning up any red ink. Despite not reducing its debt, NB Power is about to embark on more big spending, for projects such as the rebuilding of the Mactaquac Generating Station near Fredericton so that it can reach its original, 100-year life expectancy of 2068. Murphy said in recent years, NB Power has spent between $400 million and $500 million annually on big projects to upgrade its systems, much of it requiring borrowing. That figure, he said, would soon rise to $1 billion annually. Clark told reporters afterwards the latest estimate for the Mactaquac revamp was as much as $8.9 billion over a 15-year period. When the project was originally pitched in 2016, the estimate was as high as $3.6 billion, a figure Murphy last year revised to $7.2 billion because of inflation. The latest figure of $8.9 billion would work out to an annual spending bill of $593 million and is only a portion of the big spending that's to come. Murphy had emphasized that much of NB Power's infrastructure - the power lines, transformers and generators - were built in the 1950s and 1960s and would have to be replaced. The politicians weren't happy with the answers, including those from the governing party. The committee vice chair, Liberal MLA Alexandre Cédric Doucet, told reporters at the lunch break that during the first two hours of the session, he had received three emails from constituents saying they weren't satisfied with what they had heard from NB Power's top brass. ""On one hand they're saying they're not finding errors, but on the other hand they can't answer some specific questions,"" he said, referring to the three NB Power officials who fielded the queries, including vice president Brad Coady. ""This is why I am not satisfied and why New Brunswickers are not satisfied as well."" Savoie said he was also deeply disappointed. ""People need answers, people deserve answers. When you see your electricity bills going up, in some cases, so high that they match your mortgage payments, that's quite shocking. It's vital that we get to the bottom of it."" Green leader David Coon said NB Power officials went into the investigation thinking that it would simply reinforce what they believed - that people's bills seemed high because of a change in the weather, as December 2024 was colder than the previous December. ""Winter is not new,"" Coon said. ""Why are there these inexplicable increases in consumption occurring on people's bills which are driving them sky high?"" He said in the 11 years since he's been elected, he had never heard such outrage from constituents over their NB Power bills. Clark, meanwhile, told reporters the metering to billing system had been reviewed and there were no errors there. But she said a more thorough review had to be done on the meters themselves. She also said a deeper dive needed to take place on customers whose bills showed much higher electrical use. Brunswick News asked about NB Power's plan to reduce its high debt. ""There are a lot of different opportunities we can consider for managing our debt,"" said Clark, an accountant by profession. ""One is ensuring that our assets are working properly. That's the most important thing that we can do. The other thing is we have to work with government to understand the options with that. We're looking at every and all opportunities."" She said other places had come up with creative solutions to reduce a power utility's debt, which should be explored. ""We're certainly not looking for a bailout from anyone,"" she insisted, explaining that it was important to look ""at other opportunities, whether it's additional revenue streams or more support in different ways that have happened in other provinces."" She said this could include the provincial government swallowing all or a portion of NB Power's debt, shifting the burden from ratepayers to taxpayers.

Another Clark landslide; Tory MPP since 2010 returns with a massive victory,2025.0,"On an election night that saw little change at the provincial level, Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes delivered a similar result, with another crushing victory for Progressive Conservative Steve Clark. The riding 's Tory MPP since 2010 easily won his job back, returning to Queen's Park to join a Progressive Conservative majority that looks similar to the previous one, representing a section of the province that remains overwhelmingly blue. Opponents expected the 2023 Greenbelt scandal, which prompted Clark's resignation as municipal affairs minister, to leave the local MPP politically damaged and vulnerable, but in the end the Tory incumbent suffered only a small electoral dent, his margin of victory reduced by nearly three per cent but still well over 50 per cent. With all polls reporting Thursday night, Clark earned 25,107 votes or 54.94 per cent of the vote. Liberal Lorna Jean Edmonds placed second with 12,392 votes, or 27.12 per cent. Placing a distant third, with 4,471 votes (9.78%) was the New Democratic Party's Chris Wilson, while Green Party hopeful Fiona Jager, like Wilson another returning combatant, came in fourth at 2,083 (4.56%). The three candidates proposing alternative takes on conservatism finished much further behind, with the New Blue Party's Chris Garrah garnering 743 votes (1.63%), Ontario Party candidate Daniel Calabretta getting 561 (1.23%), and Libertarian Party Leader Mark Snow earning 342 (0.75 per cent). Voter turnout in the riding was 51.58 per cent, outpacing the provincial turnout of 45.37 per cent. Speaking to a small crowd of supporters on a damp winter night at his Stewart Boulevard campaign office, Clark acknowledged this winter campaign was punishing for volunteers. ""We battled the blizzard, we dodged frozen steps and sidewalks,"" said Clark as he thanked staff and supporters. Clark said it was time to get to work and address the issue at the heart of Premier Doug Ford's election call: the dangers of U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. Clark vowed to work for all constituents, regardless of how they voted. Ford's snap election, as of Thursday night, did not appear to grow his majority, but rather shrink it ever so slightly, while bringing the Liberals back from the wilderness to official party status. But Clark emphasized the historic rarity of Ford's ""back to back to back"" majorities, making him the first premier since Leslie Frost in the 1950s to secure three majority governments. While Ford joined the pantheon of electorally successful premiers with Thursday's result, Clark also took time to celebrate an electoral milestone of his own. ""I'm the only politician that's ever had 50 per cent every time they ran"" in this riding, noted the MPP-elect. ""And I thank the people for that,"" he added. ""It's humbling for me to be able to get such a strong mandate again and again, but I want people to know that I'm going to reciprocate by delivering to the riding and working hard for them."" Local Liberals nonetheless found some cause to celebrate, having grown their share of the vote by nearly nine per cent from their 2022 share of 18.25 per cent. ""This campaign was a huge success. We moved the needle,"" said Edmonds. ""Obviously I wanted to win, but I think we let Steve Clark know this riding isn't a slam dunk anymore. Steve won the vote fair and square, and I'd like to congratulate him on his win."" Edmonds showed up briefly at Clark's campaign office with a small contingent of local Liberals, including 2022 candidate Josh Bennett, to congratulate Clark. With the Greenbelt affair now seemingly behind him, at least electorally, Clark would not be drawn into a discussion about a return to cabinet in the new Ford government. ""My focus solely is to deliver for the riding,"" he said.

"Sudbury's PC candidate tells supporters 'our work is not over'; 'The values we stood for and the hope we worked toward remain crucial for the future of our beloved city,' Max Massimiliano says",2025.0,"Despite losing to incumbent NDP MPP Jamie West in a tightly fought race in the Sudbury riding, Conservative candidate Max Massimiliano remained undeterred, vowing to remain in politics and throw his hat in the ring for the next election. ""We've come too far to stop now,"" Massimiliano addressed supporters in the lower hall of the Caruso Club. By 11:30 p.m., West had secured re-election. Massimiliano said he wouldn't have run his campaign any differently and was proud of the results the party achieved in the riding that has been dominated by Liberal and NDP representation for the last 40-some years. In his concession speech, Massimiliano said he holds his head high and is full of gratitude for his team and family. He congratulated West and said it was a well-earned victory ""Though our campaign didn't end in victory, our mission has never been more important,"" he said. ""The values we stood for and the hope we worked toward remain crucial for the future of our beloved city. ""Know this, our work is not over. The ideas and passion that fueled this campaign will continue to guide us in the days to come. To my supporters, this is not the end, this is just another chapter in the ongoing effort to continue to work with the PC Party and its ongoing support of Sudbury."" Massimiliano noted the progress made in the election and those results, along with his family's sup- port, propel him forward. ""I think we will win the next time,"" he said to an applauding crowd. Afterward, Massimiliano suggested more time on the campaign trail could have produced different results, but he remained optimistic that the party's momentum will continue. ""I am staying on (as the candidate) because I believe there is good support in our community,"" he said. Massimiliano added that while he is sure West will continue to be a good representative for the city, ""I'll be there to keep him on his toes."" Campaign manager Anthony Rocca called Massimiliano ""one of the hardest guys I know."" ""He was up at five in the morning and out until nine o'clock at night,"" said Rocca. ""Just being a short campaign, it was baptism by fire for us."" Although disappointed over the loss, Rocca said he was proud of the team's efforts and accomplishments in just a short time. Longtime Conservative supporter and former federal candidate for the party, Fred Slade, said Massimiliano's campaign was the best he has seen in decades. ""I've seen great engagement with Max and his volunteers, just an amazing team that was pulled together quickly,"" said Slade. ""They've put together the best campaign I've seen in my political career."" The last time the Conservatives held the Sudbury riding was in the 1980s when Jim Gordon served (1981-87) under premiers Bill Davis and Frank Miller, as well as Larry Grossman, who served as leader of the opposition from 1985-87. Overall, the Conservatives have increased their support in the last three provincial elections in the Sudbury riding. In 2022, PC candidate Marc Despatie secured 29 per cent of the vote, which was a notable improvement from the 2018 election when the PC candidate secured 23.3 per cent of the vote.

"Sweeping win for Watt as riding flips to red; Nepean Liberals take PC stronghold with nearly 5,000 votes more than Tory candidate",2025.0,"After missing the mark by a little more than 2,000 votes in 2022, Liberal party candidate Tyler Watt pulled off a sweeping victory for the seat in Nepean, finishing nearly 5,000 votes ahead of Progressive Conservative candidate Alex Lewis. ""I'm so honoured to be a part of the Ontario Liberal party, going to Queen's Park and adding another Ottawa seat in there for us,"" Watt said. The result in Nepean flipped what had been a PC stronghold represented by Lisa MacLeod since 2006 in what was then the riding of Nepean-Carleton. MacLeod beat Watt in 2022, but he said he felt more prepared this time. ""I was door knocking until about 7:30 tonight and every door was either, 'I voted for you,' or, 'I'm about to go vote for you,' "" Watt said. ""I didn't have that experience last time, so I feel people are more familiar with me this time."" Watt's campaign team staked out the auto-detailing shop MP Detailing for his election night party, which drew more than 100 jubilant supporters. He cited the short campaign window as a challenge to reaching more voters this time. ""We had such a limited amount of time in this election,"" Watt said. ""My original plan was to take six months off from work to knock on every single door at least twice in this election because I know, if I can have that personal connection with people, that we could have a great chance at winning this election."" A registered nurse, Watt said he was instead working at a hospital ""just over four weeks ago."" He said he viewed that background as valuable in a province where ""everyone has a health-care story and everyone agrees that we want it to be better."" ""I was born and raised here. I grew up here in the '90s and I've seen how much has changed,"" Watt said. ""Back when I was a kid, it was farmland ... Now it's like its own city. ""We just haven't been given the investments needed to keep up with how much we've been expanding when it comes to road infrastructure, when it comes to access to primary care and hospitals."" Despite the loss in his first election, Lewis took it in stride, describing the campaign as one of the best experiences of his life. At his election-night party at a Barrhaven pub appropriately called The Jolly Taxpayer, Lewis said it was unfortunate that the ""tide had turned"" in Nepean. He said he knocked on about 6,000 doors during the campaign and was well-received. ""The results at the door were not reflective of what we were seeing up there (on the results screen),"" he said. At the same time, though, Lewis wasn't disappointed about going back to his job as an Ottawa police officer. ""I get to go back to policing and ride a motorcycle for a living?"" he said. ""There's worse things."" Former Nepean MPP Lisa MacLeod sent Lewis off on a high note, saying he did a great job in the short campaign and would have been a fine MPP. She was one of the high-profile members of the community who endorsed his campaign, along with former Ottawa police chief Vern White, former MP John Baird and former city councillor Jan Harder. ""It was four hard weeks for a young man who I consider to be the future of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party,"" MacLeod said. In keeping with the 2015 redrawing of federal boundaries, which divided Nepean-Carleton into separate constituencies of Nepean and Carleton, 2018 was the first provincial election for the modern riding of Nepean. Within the boundaries of Nepean is the family friendly suburb of Barrhaven, as well as several mature neighbourhoods, including Bells Corners and Craig Henry. The riding stretches from Bankfield Road in the south to Corkstown Road at its northernmost end and from Eagleson Road in the west to the Rideau River in the east. It has a population of 132,769, according to the 2021 census. Over the years since she first won election in 2006, MacLeod held cabinet positions as minister of children, community and social services and minister of sports and tourism, but also struggled with her mental health. After six winning campaigns, MacLeod announced last fall she would not run again. Lewis, a proudly gay, married father of one, has been a member of the Ottawa Police Service for a decade and was recently trained to join the squad of officers on motorcycles. He's also an Ontario Police College lecturer who instructs officers on 2SLGBTQ+ community relations and previously was executive director of the Bells Corners BIA. The NDP candidate was Max Blair, a recent Carleton University graduate who has been employed as a legislative assistant for the House of Commons. The Green party candidate was Sheilagh McLean, who previously ran in the 2018 provincial election in Ottawa-Vanier. An Ottawa resident for more than 50 years, she's a retired federal government human resources professional who remains active in her community as a volunteer and yoga teacher. Other candidates included Peter Westaway (independent), John Kovach (New Blue Party) and Carmen Charbonneau (Ontario Party). Unofficial voter turnout was 45.49 per cent in the riding.","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.","Saxberg, Lynn; Jan Son Duench",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 1, 2025",Provincial elections; Election results; Community relations,,2025-03-01,The Ottawa Citizen
"Carney leaves Tories stirred, not shaken; Poll suggests sweeping rebound for liberals, but conservatives say poilievre holds some aces Comment",2025.0,"The Conservatives first recorded a 20-point lead in public opinion last June and pundits concluded that the Liberals coming back from such a deficit was as likely as growing flowers in the desert. Yet a mere eight months later we have the first poll to suggest the governing party, which is not even under new management yet, has overhauled Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives, according to Ipsos findings released Tuesday. The Lazarus-like revival suggests the Liberals have gained 10 points of support since Ipsos's previous poll in January. For a brief moment before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned, it looked as if they were on track to lose official party status after the next election; now it's the NDP that is facing that prospect. It is an unprecedented shift in public opinion and the pressing question is: What are Poilievre's Conservatives going to do about it to shift the momentum back? The answer, according to senior Conservatives, is not much. The logic is that Poilievre still holds two aces: namely, fatigue with the Liberal party after nearly 10 years in power; and the sense among roughly eight in 10 Canadians that it is time for a change of government. Senior sources in the Conservative party say a tightening of the polls should come as no surprise, given Trudeau's deep unpopularity and the prospect that his imminent departure would see a revival of Liberal fortunes. This news might even benefit Conservatives who have become too complacent about winning and have been mentally measuring the drapes for their ministerial offices, they suggest. ""We haven't earned the trust of Canadians yet,"" one party source said. He said he is confident Poilievre will ""maul"" Mark Carney in a leaders' debate, particularly since the Conservatives still hold a lead in public opinion on the key cost-of-living issue. The risk for the Conservatives is that Carney, who is odds-on favourite to be named Liberal leader on March 9, can position himself as an agent of change. In the English-language Liberal leadership debate on Tuesday, Carney criticized the Trudeau government for relying on a surge in immigration and government spending that grew at nine per cent a year to drive the economy. ""Our economy was weak before we got to the point of these threats (of tariffs from Donald Trump). That's why we need big changes,"" he said. The record of trusted lieutenants distancing themselves from longtime leaders is not stellar: think Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in the United Kingdom, or Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien in Canada. But even though he was an adviser to the Trudeau government, Carney can plausibly disavow, and even impugn, its record in office. The U.S. president's intimi - dation is now the most pressing issue for most Canadian voters and Carney is not only presenting himself as best-positioned to deal with it but is portraying Poilievre as being unfit for the purpose. He said the Conservative leader ""worships"" Trump and is ""the wrong guy at the worst time."" During the debate, Carney blasted Poilievre's decision to refuse security clearance as ""the kind of irresponsibility, at a time when our country is under threat, that we cannot afford."" As always in these columns, I am obliged to acknowledge a friendship with Carney going back years. Long before he entered politics, I recall him saying he was criticized for being ""Michael Ignatieff with a calculator - someone who used too many ten-dollar words."" But, he said, the case could be made that we live in a ten-dollar world and simplistic slogans are not going to make Canada better off. Even Conservative MPs whisper that Carney looks like the adult in the room. With uncanny timing, he has appeared on the political scene at the moment when economic expertise and experience in managing international crises are at a premium. Poilievre's challenge is to explode this apparently providential turn of events. The Conservatives will attempt to do that with a $10-million ad blitz that tries to shackle Carney to Trudeau and the ""job-killing carbon tax."" Plenty of Canadians are prepared to believe that the new boss is the same as the old boss, particularly when it comes to carbon pricing. The Conservatives also appear to have been handed a gift in the form of a letter Carney wrote as chair of Brookfield Asset Management that they say proves the Liberal leadership candidate supported moving the investment firm's headquarters to New York from Toronto. Carney says the final decision was made after he quit the company for politics in mid-January. Either way, it is the kind of headline he could do without, as the Conservatives try to brand him as ""Sneaky Mark Carney."" Having an illustrious resumé also has its downside. It is pointless trying to predict what is going to happen next. Trump seemed to suggest Wednesday that 25 per cent tariffs will come into force on April 2, and then clarified on Thursday that they will take effect on March 4. ""They will make it impossible for Canada to sell cars ... if we don't support them, they don't exist as a country,"" he said in a rambling news conference. Yet there are more and more signs of discomfort with his position regarding Canada. Politico reported on a U.S. poll by Public First that said only 28 per cent of Americans back tariffs on Canada, versus 43 per cent who are opposed. A new study by Anderson Economic Group estimates a 25 per cent tariff would increase the cost of a full-sized SUV by US$9,000 and a pickup truck by US$8,000. Ford chief executive Jim Farley said tariffs would ""blow a hole"" in the U.S. auto sector. It is possible that the immediate existential threat blows over and the concerns of voters return to more prosaic issues where the Conservatives have the edge. But if an election were held tomorrow, as the opinion poll question puts it, we would likely have a tight race. Polling company Angus Reid Institute had the Conservatives nearly 30 points ahead of the third-place Liberals under Trudeau in the week before Christmas. An Angus Reid poll last week had them up just three points and suggested that far more Canadians view the Conservative leader unfavourably than view him favourably. It showed that Carney, who only announced his candidacy a month ago, is now the most popular federal politician in the country.

But if an election were held tomorrow, as the opinion poll question puts it, we would likely have a tight race. Polling company Angus Reid Institute had the Conservatives nearly 30 points ahead of the third-place Liberals under Trudeau in the week before Christmas. An Angus Reid poll last week had them up just three points and suggested that far more Canadians view the Conservative leader unfavourably than view him favourably. It showed that Carney, who only announced his candidacy a month ago, is now the most popular federal politician in the country. Life comes at you fast.

"Carney leaves Tories stirred, not shaken; Poll suggests sweeping rebound for liberals, but conservatives say poilievre holds some aces",2025.0,"The Conservatives first recorded a 20-point lead in public opinion last June and pundits concluded that the Liberals coming back from such a deficit was as likely as growing flowers in the desert. Yet a mere eight months later we have the first poll to suggest the governing party, which is not even under new management yet, has overhauled Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives, according to Ipsos findings released Tuesday. The Lazarus-like revival suggests the Liberals have gained 10 points of support since Ipsos's previous poll in January. For a brief moment before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resigned, it looked as if they were on track to lose official party status after the next elec- tion; now it's the NDP that is facing that prospect. It is an unprecedented shift in public opinion and the pressing question is: What are Poilievre's Conservatives going to do about it to shift the momentum back? The answer, according to senior Conservatives, is not much. The logic is that Poilievre still holds two aces: namely, fatigue with the Liberal party after nearly 10 years in power; and the sense among roughly eight in 10 Canadians that it is time for a change of government. Senior sources in the Conservative party say a tightening of the polls should come as no surprise, given Trudeau's deep unpopularity and the prospect that his imminent departure would see a revival of Liberal fortunes. This news might even benefit Conservatives who have become too complacent about winning and have been mentally measuring the drapes for their ministerial offices, they suggest. ""We haven't earned the trust of Canadians yet,"" one party source said. He said he is confident Poilievre will ""maul"" Mark Carney in a leaders' debate, particularly since the Conservatives still hold a lead in public opinion on the key cost-of-living issue. The risk for the Conservatives is that Carney, who is odds-on favourite to be named Liberal leader on March 9, can position himself as an agent of change. In the English-language Liberal leadership debate on Tuesday, Carney criticized the Trudeau government for relying on a surge in immigration and government spending that grew at nine per cent a year to drive the economy. ""Our economy was weak before we got to the point of these threats (of tariffs from Donald Trump). That's why we need big changes,"" he said. The record of trusted lieutenants distancing themselves from longtime leaders is not stellar: think Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in the United Kingdom, or Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien in Canada. But even though he was an adviser to the Trudeau government, Carney can plausibly disavow, and even impugn, its record in office. The U.S. president's intimi - dation is now the most pressing issue for most Canadian voters and Carney is not only presenting himself as best-positioned to deal with it but is portraying Poilievre as being unfit for the purpose. He said the Conservative leader ""worships"" Trump and is ""the wrong guy at the worst time."" During the debate, Carney blasted Poilievre's decision to refuse security clearance as ""the kind of irresponsibility, at a time when our country is under threat, that we cannot afford."" As always in these columns, I am obliged to acknowledge a friendship with Carney going back years. Long before he entered politics, I recall him saying he was criticized for being ""Michael Ignatieff with a calculator - someone who used too many ten-dollar words."" But, he said, the case could be made that we live in a ten-dollar world and simplistic slogans are not going to make Canada better off. Even Conservative MPs whisper that Carney looks like the adult in the room. With uncanny timing, he has appeared on the political scene at the moment when economic expertise and experience in managing international crises are at a premium. Poilievre's challenge is to explode this apparently providential turn of events. The Conservatives will attempt to do that with a $10-million ad blitz that tries to shackle Carney to Trudeau and the ""job-killing carbon tax."" Plenty of Canadians are prepared to believe that the new boss is the same as the old boss, particularly when it comes to carbon pricing. The Conservatives also appear to have been handed a gift in the form of a letter Carney wrote as chair of Brookfield Asset Management that they say proves the Liberal leadership candidate supported moving the investment firm's headquarters to New York from Toronto. Carney says the final decision was made after he quit the company for politics in mid-January. Either way, it is the kind of headline he could do without, as the Conservatives try to brand him as ""Sneaky Mark Carney."" Having an illustrious resumé also has its downside. It is pointless trying to predict what is going to happen next. Trump seemed to suggest Wednesday that 25 per cent tariffs will come into force on April 2, and then clarified on Thursday that they will take effect on March 4. ""They will make it impossible for Canada to sell cars ... if we don't support them, they don't exist as a country,"" he said in a rambling news conference. Yet there are more and more signs of discomfort with his position regarding Canada. Politico reported on a U.S. poll by Public First that said only 28 per cent of Americans back tariffs on Canada, versus 43 per cent who are opposed. A new study by Anderson Economic Group estimates a 25 per cent tariff would increase the cost of a full-sized SUV by US$9,000 and a pickup truck by US$8,000. Ford chief executive Jim Farley said tariffs would ""blow a hole"" in the U.S. auto sector. It is possible that the immediate existential threat blows over and the concerns of voters return to more prosaic issues where the Conservatives have the edge. But if an election were held tomorrow, as the opinion poll question puts it, we would likely have a tight race.

"Blue-collar appeal, tariff fears drive PC win:   Ford leads his party to a third term in power, though not the bigger majority they had hoped for",2025.0,"Doug Ford trumped his rivals Thursday to win a third term as premier by stoking concerns about American tariffs and relying on his ""Big Blue Collar Machine,"" although the victory came at a cost. Appearing at campaign stops with grateful workers whose unions had been given millions for training and skills-development programs in recent years, Ford boasted almost daily about winning new endorsements. That support - in addition to the backing of 16 mayors including Patrick Brown of Brampton, Oshawa's Dan Carter and Drew Dilkens in Windsor - helped send the Progressive Conservative leader back to Queen's Park. So did Ford's constant signals that he would pour billions into Ontario's economy to offset damage from U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs - in the tradition of financial supports during COVID-19. ""I will work with every level of government and every political stripe because fighting back against Donald Trump, standing up for Canada, will take a full team Ontario effort, it will take a full Team Canada effort,"" Ford said to a sparse crowd of about 200 supporters who filled barely a third of the Toronto Congress Centre, on the airport strip. ""We'll retrain workers for better jobs and bigger paycheques, we'll retool companies for new customers and new markets ... we promise to do whatever it takes to 'Protect Ontario,'"" he added in a nod to his campaign slogan. But Ford's roll of the election dice to seek a stronger mandate - his PCs had 79 MPPs at dissolution and won 83 in the 2022 vote - backfired and he lost seats in Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Ajax and Nepean to the Liberals. While his Conservatives gained Hamilton Mountain and Algoma-Manitoulin, they did not take other ridings they had targeted, such as NDP-held Windsor West and Niagara Falls, as well as Haldimand-Norfolk - where voters soundly rejected PC candidate Amy Martin to stick with Independent MPP Bobbi Ann Brady. The snap early election had been in the making since at least last spring. Ford first hinted at it in May when he wouldn't commit to sticking to the next scheduled provincewide vote in June 2026. That left him in control of the timing, to the disadvantage of opposition parties left scrambling to finalize their slates of candidates when he confirmed in late January that Ontarians would be heading to the polls. After months of an unofficial precampaign focused on the federal government's carbon levy and dubbing new Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie the ""queen of the carbon tax"" - even though she renounced it - Ford's team quickly pivoted to the tariff threat when Trump won a second term in early November. Never mind that the PC leader got caught in a hot-mic gaffe Feb. 3 telling supporters at his Etobicoke North riding campaign office that he ""100 per cent"" cheered for a Trump victory despite repeated promises of tariffs. While rivals called out Ford for ""hypocrisy"" and accused him of calling the vote to get ahead of an RCMP investigation into his government's Greenbelt land-swap scandal, most voters apparently didn't agree, or forgave him. The Trump-centric nature of the campaign overshadowed other, homegrown concerns. That made it difficult for the NDP, Liberals and Greens to dent Ford's armour despite spotlighting serious issues such as a shortage of physicians that has left 2.5 million Ontarians without a family doctor, worsening ""hallway health care"" in overcrowded hospitals, skyrocketing housing costs and growing homeless encampments in parks. ""People aren't talking about that,"" Ford maintained Wednesday in Oldcastle, near Windsor. ""They're talking about the economy. They're talking about tariffs."" He then gave a nod to his campaign organization for garnering endorsements from 17 unions and mayors that often prefer to keep their political views to themselves or support other parties. ""I've never seen a more well-oiled machine than what we have right now,"" said a smiling Ford, who wrested ridings from the NDP in Windsor, Brampton and Timmins in the 2022 election thanks to the blue-collar strategy. But as the celebrations fade, Ford will knuckle down to what could be his most challenging term as premier with two wary eyes - one on the future and the other on the past. There are Trump tariffs that would devastate the economy and the possibility of charges in the RCMP Greenbelt probe rocking his government to the core.

Caitlin Clark Effect in play at high school provincials,2025.0,"Caitlin Clark connects. With her play at the University of Iowa and now the WNBA's Indiana Fever, the 23-year-old Clark is credited with being an engine behind women's basketball powering its way toward a larger mainstream audience. The idea of the Caitlin Clark Effect gets thrown around enough that it has its own Wikipedia page. It hits here, too, with her name and game resonating with B.C. high school players. The senior girls' basketball provincials are celebrating their 75th anniversary this week. Action begins in all four tiers at the Langley Events Centre today, culminating with the finals there Saturday. ""I'll be walking into my class and I'll hear people talking about how Caitlin Clark dropped 50 (points) on Angel Reese last night, and how she's way better than Angel Reese,"" St. Thomas More Knights Grade 10 guard Kyla Limon said, pointing to another rising star in women's hoops. ""People in my grade talk about it. The guys too. ""It's crazy to look at how many people are watching women's sports now compared to even two years ago, and she's such a part of that. And I think she's helping girls get out of their comfort zone and gain confidence in sports."" Riverside Rapids Grade 12 guard Jorja Hart added: ""Caitlin Clark is a big influence. She's showing what girls are capable of doing within sports. She's always super-humble and works hard, and I think that she's a good role model for players in B.C. to have."" Demicah Arnaldo, who's a Grade 11 guard with Burnaby's STM, says the increased media attention that women's sports in both Canada and the U.S. is getting is easily apparent, and teammate Mia Beliveau, who's a Grade 11 guard/ forward, believes that ""it's inspiring to see how women's basketball has grown."" Longtime Riverside coach Paul Langford says Clark's practice routines captured on things like YouTube and her Instagram updates are routinely talking points with his Port Coquitlam squad. He used to cite Michael Jordan and LeBron James as his examples when he was explaining drills and schemes in practice. Now, it's players like Clark and Reese, and Paige Bueckers. Clark is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history - man or woman. One of the reasons for that is her seemingly endless three-point range. You get the feeling at times that she could hit shots from the parking lot. The Fever posted on Instagram in August that Clark's three-pointers at the time were coming from an average of 28 feet, 1.1 inches, which was two feet better than any other player in the league. The WNBA three-point line is at 22 feet, 1.75 inches. Outside shooting has become trendy in boys' basketball in this province the past few years, and it's been attributed to the long-range prowess of Steph Curry. It's happening in the girls' game now, and it's being tied to Clark. ""Every now and then you might mutter, 'Hey, you're not Caitlin Clark. We don't want you jacking it up that much,'"" Langford said with a laugh. ""But, obviously, she's a super-positive influence on the girls' game and women's sports in general. It just helps when you can see it at the next level."" B.C. girls' basketball is taking its own step-up-a-level at these provincials. To celebrate the anniversary, the LEC has tracked down photographs from past championship squads, and a group of coaches and organizers have selected all-decade all-star teams. As well, championship Saturday this time around will be played in the main arena for the first time, like the boys' finals are. Last year's championship Saturday for the girls at the LEC's Centre Court was superb, with down-to-the-wire finishes in all four games and countless highlight-reel plays. The atmosphere was raucous throughout. The crowd maxed out at a little more than 2,000, according to organizers, and there was a suggestion that was a tournament record. The arena is a much bigger venue. There have been boys' finals with game attendances reported at more than 6,000. Bobby Braich, who's the longtime coach of Abbotsford's Yale Lions, has been a proponent of moving the championship Saturday to the arena. ""There's the one or two coaches who have reached out to me and said, 'Are we sure we want to do this?'"" Braich said of the Saturday switch. ""But I think we're going to outperform. I'm so bullish and so excited. I've been at the ground level trying to make this happen and now I'm seeing key people who weren't maybe with this initially who are coming on full force now."" Part of Braich's inspiration for change, he says, came from watching firsthand Clark at Seattle in the 2023 NCAA Tournament Regional championship. That included Clark scoring or assisting on every field goal in Iowa's 25-point first quarter in the finals against Louisville, en route to finishing with 41 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 97-83 win. ""I walked out of there thinking that was the best female basketball player I've ever seen in my life, and so did everybody else in the building,"" Braich said.

Ford unclear on how province would pay for billions in PC promises,2025.0,"Ontario's Progressive Conservatives released their platform Monday, with three days until election day, and it contains $40 billion in promises plus a proposal to get rid of the minimum retail price for liquor. Minimum prices for spirits vary based on volume and alcohol content and are indexed to inflation, and the minimum retail price for a 750 millilitre bottle of vodka is currently set to rise this weekend to $31.15. Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford has not made any public announcements about his alcohol promise, unlike in 2018 when he made setting the price floor for beer at $1 - or Buck-aBeer - a central part of his campaign. Few breweries took part in Buck-a-Beer after it was implemented. Ford's platform does not include a full costing breakdown of how he would pay for his promises and contains some pledges with no cost estimates, such as his plan to build a tunnel under Highway 401. Among the $40 billion worth of promises are a few previously unannounced measures including a $5-billion Protect Ontario Account to help respond to American tariffs, $705 million to expand STEM and skilled trades training capacity at post-secondary institutions, and $50 million to support modular housing technology. Ford offered little clarity over the weekend on how he would pay for billions of dollars in promises if re-elected, as looming tariffs from the U.S. continue to keep economic stability at the forefront of the election campaign. Ford was pressed on how he would cover proposals such as building a tunnel under Highway 401 at a campaign stop in Sault Ste. Marie Sunday, a day before his party was set to release its platform for Thursday's vote. ""I believe in growing revenue,"" Ford said during an event at the Algoma Steel plant, suggesting this was previously achieved by growing the tax base but offering no specific measures. Ford has pitched himself as the best option to protect Ontario's economy, and triggered the snap election arguing that he needs a stronger mandate to navigate the next four years of a Donald Trump presidency in the United States. The other leaders have called the election unnecessary, saying they would have backed stimulus measures proposed by the majority Progressive Conservatives in response to possible U.S. tariffs. When asked Sunday when he would lay out his plan to deal with the tariffs, Ford said: ""Well, you don't have a plan without seeing what they're going to come at us (with.)"" ""We have a strong plan to reinvest into the people, into jobs,"" he said. Ford previously announced that if re-elected, he would spend $10 billion on support for employers through a six-month deferral of provincially administered taxes on Ontario businesses and $3 billion toward payroll tax and premium relief. Another $600 million would go toward a fund aimed at attracting investment, as well as $300 million to expand an Ontario manufacturing tax credit. NDP Leader Marit Stiles and Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie have also presented their vision to take on the levies. New Democrats have promised to bring in a federal-provincial income support program in response to tariffs, and direct agencies to procure locally and create new supply chains for trade-exposed industries. The Liberals have said they will establish a ""fight tariff fund"" that would give Ontario businesses a lower interest rate, and offer a $150,000 bonus to Canadian doctors and nurses working in the U.S. if they return here to work. Ford has called northern Ontario the ""frontline"" against the tariffs, in part because of the mineral-rich Ring of Fire region northeast of Thunder Bay. His announcements over the weekend have centred on fast-tracking projects in the region, including the creation of a new, $500-million fund meant to speed up development of processing projects and attract private capital investment. The money would be available over three years, a spokesperson said. Ford's northern tour has also seen him face questions regarding his candidates' lack of participation in local debates in Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie. ""I encourage all our candidates ... you don't have to go to these debates. Some do, some don't,"" he said Sunday, adding he would rather have them ""knocking on doors, talking to the people directly."" The Canadian Press has requested interviews with PC candidates in several key ridings, which were not granted. Ford's opponents have also accused him of going into hiding after he didn't take questions on the campaign trail for more than a week. The PCs are the last major party to release a platform. The Liberals and the NDP released their full platforms Friday with less than a week to go until election day, while the Greens presented their plan on Feb. 12. Stiles and Crombie both spent time in Ottawa on Sunday, with Stiles also making campaign stops in Peterborough and Bowmanville, and Crombie beginning her day in Kingston. Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner canvassed in Elora with a local candidate.

Ontario opposition parties face uphill fight:   Liberals’ Crombie and NDP’s Stiles lag behind PC Leader Doug Ford in snap winter election amid Trump tariff crisis,2025.0,"An Ontario Liberal TV ad, which debuted during the fraught U.S.Canada hockey final last week, depicts a shivering woman on a gurney being left in a hospital parking lot. It asks viewers: “What happens after the hallways fill up? Stop Doug Ford before we find out.” It’s unclear whether the unusual spot – which was only 14 seconds long and contained no images of Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie – had any impact on Ontario voters before Connor McDavid fired the puck home to defeat the Americans in overtime. The province’s election campaign is now entering the final minutes of its own third period, with voting set for Thursday. And the Liberal ad was just one of many pucks the opposition has tried to aim at Mr. Ford, the Progressive Conservative Leader who has effortlessly blocked almost every shot he has faced, with polls suggesting he could win a historic third majority government. Both Ms. Crombie and NDP Leader Marit Stiles have had their work cut out for them. Both are rookie leaders, facing a snap election in the dead of winter that left them scrambling to nominate candidates and draw up complete platforms, which they both just released in the last few days. They are also facing an electorate fixated on U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs and use “economic force” to take over Canada – threats that Mr. Ford has made the central focus of his campaign. His slogan is “Protect Ontario.” His slick TV ads call him a fighter, while making use of jump-cut clips of his appearances on U.S. news networks. The PC Party picked up the tab for his trips to Washington to lobby lawmakers there, amid complaints they were unfair photo-ops. Mr. Ford’s focused campaign on the tariff threat has made it next-to-impossible for Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie to shift to other issues, such as the crisis in the province’s health care system, where they feel Mr. Ford is more vulnerable. His opponents also point to the current RCMP investigation into Mr. Ford’s aborted move to open up parts of the protected Greenbelt to select developers, accusing him of calling an early election to get ahead of any potential charges. But Mr. Ford has remained the first choice for Ontario voters, by double-digit margins in most polls for months – long before he took up his anti-tariff fight and despite public-opinion data also showing low approval ratings for him personally. Nothing in the campaign has significantly moved the needle, not even his “hot mic” moment, when he admitted on camera he was “100 per cent” happy last November when Mr. Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The resulting campaign has seen Mr. Ford’s two main rivals throw a variety of attacks at the PC Leader, while also setting their sights on each other. The 65-year-old Ms. Crombie, who won her party’s leadership in December, 2023, has faced an uphill struggle to revive Ontario’s Liberals, often jokingly called the “minivan party” because they had just nine seats in the legislature after two disastrous elections. But she rejuvenated the party’s fundraising and insisted on tacking less to the left and more to the centre-right. She has been taking increasingly aggressive shots at Mr. Ford, calling his notion of a $60-billion to $120-billion tunnel under Highway 401 “dumb” and a “fantasy” in the televised leaders’ debate. She has also made fixing health care her main theme, promising everyone in Ontario access to a family doctor in four years and saying she’d spend $3-billion to do it. And she has pledged a broadbased tax cut – something Mr. Ford said he would do in 2018 but never delivered. From almost the moment she stepped into the role, the former mayor of Mississauga and former federal Liberal MP has faced a relentless campaign of PC Party attack ads. Mr. Ford routinely calls her the “queen of the carbon tax,” though she now says she disapproves of the federal fuel charge. Recently published opinion polls have shown her pulling ahead of the NDP in the popular vote, but still well behind Mr. Ford’s PCs. Her campaign, hurt by a rush to vet and nominate candidates, has hit some rough spots. She was forced to jettison her Oshawa candidate over an inflammatory and homophobic 2023 social-media post about the killing of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Ms. Crombie, who did not have a seat in the legislature, is running for one in Mississauga. In last week’s leaders’ debate, she pleaded with NDP voters to back the Liberals, saying she was the only leader who could beat Mr. Ford. Ms. Stiles dismissed it as a desperate ploy as the Liberals seek to regain the 12 seats required for official party status in the legislature. The Liberals are also running geographically targeted digital ads in close ridings, making the same appeal to NDP supporters thinking of switching. One Toronto NDP candidate, in Eglinton-Lawrence, had already dropped out on her own to support the Liberal there. Ms. Crombie has also tried to connect to voters by sharing her life story. Speaking to a Canadian Club business luncheon at the Royal York hotel last week, she pointed to rising homelessness under Mr. Ford and announced a commitment to fully fund mental health care. And she choked up as she recounted the alcoholism, homelessness and early death of her own estranged biological father in a Toronto shelter. “My dad was living at Seaton House, not far from here,” she said, pacing the stage. “And he was dying. His addiction that had taken his family, and his home, and was now claiming his life.” At the same time last Thursday, Ms. Stiles was giving a pep talk to about 40 volunteers jammed into the storefront serving as headquarters for the NDP candidate in the Liberal-held east-end Toronto riding of Beaches-East York. The Newfoundland-born Ms. Stiles, 55, is Ontario’s Official Opposition Leader – but for how long depends on election night. The NDP had 28 seats at dissolution, compared to the Liberals’ nine. In 2022, the NDP captured about four times as many seats as the Liberals, despite the two parties tying in the popular vote with 24 per cent. But recent polls show the NDP trailing Ms. Crombie’s party. Ms. Stiles, a former union policy adviser and school trustee who was acclaimed to her current post in 2023, says her party is still running to win. She says the NDP is focusing on what she calls “orange/blue” ridings, in Niagara, and Southwestern and Northern Ontario – where she says her party is in head-to-head battles with the PCs. Liberal campaigners charge that Ms. Stiles, MPP for Toronto’s Davenport, is actually focused on saving existing NDP seats threatened by the inroads Mr. Ford has made through winning the endorsement of construction and skilled trades worker unions. The NDP accuses the Liberals of similarly focusing on its traditional toeholds. “I think Bonnie Crombie and the Liberals have kind of given up the fight. Doug Ford quit as premier. I never give up. I will not stop fighting. I will not quit,” Ms. Stiles tells reporters before hopping over the snowbanks on Danforth Avenue to climb back aboard her orange campaign bus. “I am running to be the premier of this province.” Her party usually enjoys an advantage in attracting volunteers, including from its union supporters, that could help it get out its vote in what is expected to be a low-turnout election. While decrying Mr. Ford’s deals with “insiders,” her campaign has largely focused on trying to present Ms. Stiles as a trustworthy, down-to-earth leader who would fight to protect Ontario jobs from Mr. Trump while putting billions more into health care and schools. On housing, she has promised to get the government involved directly in building affordable homes and enforcing strict rent controls. She has also pledged to hand out monthly grocery-price rebate cheques for low- and middle-income families, and vowed to make the privately run and tolled Highway 407 free – without explaining how. With promises squarely aimed at voters’ wallets, both opposition leaders have in some ways borrowed from the playbook of Mr. Ford, who rarely misses a chance to crow about the licence-plate sticker fees he cancelled in 2022, or his distaste for road tolls. The 60-year-old PC Leader, who launched his hastily conceived 2018 campaign for his party’s leadership from his mother’s basement, is now on the verge of winning three majority governments in a row – which would make him the first Ontario premier to do so since fellow Tory Leslie Frost in 1959. After running the U.S. branch of the family label-printing business, Mr. Ford rose to prominence as a Toronto city councillor during the tumultuous mayoralty of his brother Rob Ford, who made global headlines a decade ago for erratic behaviour and alcohol and drug abuse, and died of cancer in 2016. After unsuccessfully taking over his ailing brother’s re-election run, Doug Ford soon turned his sights to provincial politics, when then-PC leader Patrick Brown was forced to resign in a scandal. Mr. Ford would lead the PCs to victory over then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne in 2018, and he would win again in 2022. While he has claimed he needed a snap election to secure a new mandate to deal with Mr. Trump, Mr. Ford and his advisers had been mulling an early election since at least last spring, when he announced hundreds of millions of dollars to speed up the introduction of beer sales in corner stores. In the fall, he laid more groundwork, announcing that he would send out $200 cheques to most taxpayers despite still running deficits. His campaign has been relentless in its focus on fighting the threatened tariffs and boosting the economy, including pledges to spend billions to cushion the blow for Ontario companies. Some seat projections based on polling data last week suggested he could win more than 90 of the legislature’s 124 seats, up from his current 79. Mike Schreiner, Leader of the Green Party of Ontario, is hoping to hang on to the party’s two seats. One common enemy all the campaigns have faced is the weather. Over the roar of traffic on a snowdrift-lined street in Etobicoke, Liberal candidate John Campbell says Mr. Ford’s snap election in February seems aimed at keeping people from voting at all. “It’s hard to put up signs. It’s hard to make your way along sidewalks. People don’t want to have the door open,” says the former city councillor, who is taking on PC cabinet minister Kinga Surma. “It’s anti-democratic, really, to have it at the worst time of year.” With a report from Laura Stone","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Gray, Jeff",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 25, 2025",Political campaigns; Nominations; Negative campaigning; Legislatures; Voters; Political advertising; Voter behavior; Elections; Tariffs; Political leadership,,2025-02-25,The Globe and Mail
"Windsor-Essex PC candidates dodge debates; 'It's undemocratic, and hopefully they'll reconsider,' city councillor says",2025.0,"Essex County's Tory candidates are under fire for refusing to face their Ontario election rivals in public debate during the current campaign - and they and their party appear unwilling to say why. Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario headquarters will not acknowledge if it's an official policy or edict from PC Leader Doug Ford, and local candidates haven't responded to the Star's calls or messages. But the local practice of dodging debates and media questions appears to be a common theme for Tory candidates across Ontario. ""It is inherently less democratic,"" Jeffrey Dvorkin, a senior fel- low at Massey College and former University of Toronto journalism program director, told the Star. ""This is about micromanaging a campaign, which Ford has done in the past, which is to say there'll be one message and it should always be from either the premier or a senior cabinet minister."" The Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce was forced to cancel its traditional all-candidates election debate this week for the ridings of Windsor West, Windsor-Tecumseh, and Essex due to lack of participation. Chamber president Ryan Donally said some parties had yet to choose candidates, while all candidates for one party declined to participate. A source with knowl- edge of the debates told the Star the party refusing to take part was the Progressive Conservatives. Parties eligible for the debate included the Liberals, NDP, Green party, and PCs, who all have representation at Queen's Park. Incumbent PC candidates Anthony Leardi in Essex and Andrew Dowie in Windsor-Tecumseh, along with Windsor West candidate Tony Francis, did not respond to the Star's repeated requests for comments about why they refused to join the debate. Leardi and Francis also refused to talk to reporters following PC party Leader Doug Ford's campaign kickoff in Windsor. Dowie did talk to reporters that day, but has since ignored multiple interview requests from the Star, including for a phone interview or emailed responses to questions for an election riding profile. Dowie and Francis were also no- shows at a Windsor-Tecumseh and Windsor West candidates forum hosted Wednesday night by Emmanuel United Church. Other candidates running in those ridings showed up. Windsor's Ward 9 Coun. Kieran McKenzie, who watched that debate, took to social media to congratulate the candidates ""who had enough courage and respect for basic principles of democracy to show up."" He also wrote ""shame on you"" to those who didn't appear. McKenzie told the Star that it's ""incumbent"" on candidates to take all steps possible to communicate what they will do if elected. That includes attending debates and responding to media questions, he said. ""They need to talk,"" said McKenzie. ""That's what an election campaign is about, having that conversation with the public. They're not engaging, and it's sad. ""It's undemocratic, and hopefully they'll reconsider."" Tory candidates in several other cities have also refused media interview requests or debate invitations, including those in Timmins, Sudbury, Halton, Walkerton, Owen Sound, Durham, Sarnia-Lambton, and Brampton, among others. In response to the Star's request for comment, a PC party staffer identified only as Caitlin repeated verbatim a message sent to media in other cities who had similar questions about the lack of engagement. ""Ontario PC candidates will spend every day of the campaign at people's doors, speaking to voters about our plan to protect Ontario."" Caitlin did not respond to a follow-up email asking for more explanation, including how attending a debate would negate the ability to knock on doors, as candidates from other parties are doing. twilhelm@postmedia.com","The Windsor Star; Windsor, Ont.","Windsor, Ont.","Wilhelm, Trevor",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 22, 2025",Candidates; Debates; Elections,,2025-02-22,The Windsor Star
"Canada flag insert in newspaper was welcome surprise I would ...[Derived Headline ] :   Ontario NDP candidate withdraws in Eglinton-Lawrence, citing close PC-Liberal race, Feb. 14 Fans at 4 Nations boo U.S. anthem before three fights open spirited U.S.-Canada game, Feb. 15",2025.0,"Canada flag insert in newspaper was welcome surprise I would like to thank the Star for including a full-page Canadian flag in last Saturday's issue. I don't consider myself a flag-waver and generally display my patriotism verbally. I do, however, own an enormous Canadian flag that once flew over Centre Block on Parliament Hill and that was presented to me after 40 years of military service. Although I am extremely proud to own it, it is too large for me to display. Hence my delight upon opening the Star and discovering the full-colour flag. I felt a surge of national pride and immediately taped the paper version to my front door. Thank you, Canada. Maurice Sacco, Toronto Thank you for the Canadian flag insert in the Saturday Star. The closest thing we had previously was our Air Canada luggage tags. We tried to buy a flag when everyone was encouraged to show solidarity, but no surprise, everything was sold out. So instead, we taped the Star insert to one of our windows in honour of Flag Day, and we've decided to leave it there indefinitely. We're not the types who would ever even display a lawn sign during an election, but this moment feels different. Nancy Miller, Toronto NDP candidate shows leadership Ontario NDP candidate withdraws in Eglinton-Lawrence, citing close PC-Liberal race, Feb. 14 NDP hopeful Natasha Doyle-Merrick provided some badly needed leadership by withdrawing her candidacy in Eglinton-Lawrence to give the Liberal candidate a better chance of defeating their Progressive Conservative rival in the upcoming Ontario election. We need this kind of leadership from progressive candidates now more than ever. It's high time the provincial and federal progressive parties united and formed a common front against the conservative parties, which are moving more to the right. As author Susan Weiman writes in her recent book ""The Left Is Not Woke,"" progressive movements need to stop fighting among themselves and unite. We need to do this in Ontario and Canada before it's too late. Joanne Clarke, Toronto Better ways to protest than booing the U.S. anthem Fans at 4 Nations boo U.S. anthem before three fights open spirited U.S.-Canada game, Feb. 15 I vehemently disagree with the idea of booing the U.S. national anthem at sporting events. However, I do think Canadian fans are right to show some displeasure. I've seen some situations in which people who want to protest something simply turn their backs on it. I think if Canadian fans were to turn their backs on the United States flag and remain absolutely silent while the anthem played, that would be a highly effective form of protest. Michael Neill, Thornhill What's up with Canadians booing the U.S. national anthem? If you have a beef with President Donald Trump, then boo him - don't boo the American people, who, for the most part, love our Canadian neighbours. Like you, most of us would prefer that Canada remain Canada and not become the 51st state. Americans and Canadians have always gotten along like siblings, so let's try to keep it that way and keep politics out of this. John Lemandri, Williamsburg, Va. The past few weeks have been very troubling for Canadians, given what Trump is imposing on our country and our people. It's not only the tariffs; it's also the insulting things he says about Canada. The result: Trump has unwittingly united us. However, booing the U.S. national anthem is wrong. The American people are not at fault. It's Trump who is taking these actions and making outrageous statements. The NHL and NBA players are not the cause of your anger: they're simply doing their job. If you choose to watch the game at home or in person, please show respect for the anthems and show your displeasure in other ways. Let's show the world that Canadians are better this. Please stand, remove your hat and either sing or stay quiet while the anthems play. Susan Beals, Richmond Hill I completely understand the sentiment of Canadian fans booing American teams at sporting events. It's a way to let Trump and his ilk know how we feel and, really, how often do we really get the chance to express ourselves in a way that reaches so many people? I don't like to hear it, though, as it seems very rude and lowers us to a level that we Canadians don't generally stoop to. I wonder whether there might be a more gentle (dare I say polite?) or less mean way to convey our ire. How about we decline to sing their anthem, and instead stay silent and turn our backs to the whole event? Annie Barrett, Alliston, Ont. Kudos to those dedicated paper delivery people I would like to shout out my thanks to the delivery people who are doing such a great job despite these snowy conditions. In particular, I want to single out our Star delivery person. Here in Collingwood, we always get more snow than folk down south, but this year it's been far worse than usual. This morning, my driveway was literally impassible, and I feared the worst for our copy of the newspaper. I was amazed to see what happened next: it was apparent that our delivery person had stopped on the road and walked the paper to our very front door. Much appreciated, and beyond the call of duty!

"Can Ontario afford more Ford?:   Please: Anyone but Doug Ford, Feb. 14 With the provincial election just days away, readers sound off on PC leader's record",2025.0,"Please: Anyone but Doug Ford, Feb. 14 I am urging everyone to get out and vote on Feb. 27 - and to take a hard look at Doug Ford's failed leadership before they do so. Sure, Ford can be charming with his folksiness. But does anyone recall his cancellation of the very efficient cap-and-trade system? His plan to build a needless Highway 413? The Greenbelt fiasco he was forced to roll back? The list goes on and on. Dave Brown, Waterloo It is imperative that before going to the polls, Ontario voters take an unbiased look at Ford's record to date. Don't be fooled by his ""one of the little guys"" persona. He isn't one of us, and his record seems to indicate that he prefers the rich guys to the little guys. Why does Ford want a new mandate? I suspect the answer is simple: he doesn't want to risk having his support vanish when the RCMP investigation into the Greenbelt scandal goes public. He doesn't want his supporters to see him for what he is - a political opportunist, first and foremost. Voters should take a critical look at the implications of giving Ford what he wants. Canada's trade war with the United States probably won't last four years, meaning Ford would have plenty of time to carry out his costly pie-in-the-sky ideas with a new mandate. How many Americans wish they had taken a critical second look at the implications of putting their ""X"" beside Trump's name and are now living with the consequences? Let's not make the same mistake. Patricia Steward, Toronto As a Torontonian of 45 years, I am amazed and shocked to see that there are Ontarians who believe Doug Ford will have any influence on Canada-U.S. trade negotiations or anything else of importance to our way of life or our future. He's no more than a minor player. His trip to Washington was a waste of time and money, not to mention an insult to every Ontarian. Former premier David Peterson tried the early election ruse in 1990, but voters saw through it. Hopefully, Trump's bombast will not blind Ontarians to Ford's brand of opportunism 35 years later. Ken Luckhardt, Toronto Justin Ling has voiced the sentiments I've held since the 2022 election. If Ford is the best we've got to lead the province through difficult times, then we are in serious trouble. Everything he touches seems to be fraught with issues and costly to taxpayers. Ask yourself whether you're any better off now than you were seven years ago, when Ford was first elected. So many things in Ontario seem to have gotten worse since then, such as the cost of living, our health-care system (including a lack of family doctors and insufficient hospital funding), our education system, public transit and housing. Brian Drake, Toronto Ontario residents have been receiving their $200 ""vote for me"" cheques in the mail. In the televised leaders' debate this week, Ford again called it a rebate of taxpayers' own money, though the government was already running a projected $3-billion deficit. This so-called rebate is more like an extra $3.1-billion loan to be repaid with interest by Ontario taxpayers and their children over decades. Respect for taxpayers' money is nothing but an empty Ford slogan that voters should reject.

"Ford back in Washington to win allies:   PC leader renews appeal to U.S. lawmakers about Trump's tariffs, but admits it's a daunting task",2025.0,"A frustrated Doug Ford admitted he's fighting an uphill battle to change the hearts and minds of American lawmakers in his clash against U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. Buoyed by Canada's nail-biting overtime victory over Team U.S.A. in the 4 Nations hockey tournament, the Progressive Conservative leader and Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston attended the winter meeting of the National Governors Association with bragging rights but a daunting task. ""No one down here knows what he wants, and we don't know what he wants,"" Ford said of Trump. ""What's shocking to me is how misinformed a lot of elected officials down here (are), how critical a role Canada plays in their economy,"" added Ford, speaking of electricity exports, critical minerals, steel and aluminum. Ford's meetings with several governors were delayed after their meeting with Trump at the White House ran long. Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky suggested state leaders from one party tend to be more sympathetic to Canadian concerns about tariffs and trade. ""Our Democratic governors certainly believe that we shouldn't be looking at a general tariff against Canada,"" added the second-term Democrat who said tariffs would push prices up for consumers in a ""Trump tax."" North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a former Republican congressman, said he believes Trump is using tariffs as a ""negotiating tool"" toward a renewed Canada-U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement. ""The White House wants to reset the deck and wants to bring manufacturing back home. And I think that's a great idea."" Neither governor thought much of Trump's repeated taunts about Canada becoming the 51st state. ""I love hunting in Canada, and I love my neighbours to the north, but I'm not particularly sure that's the world's greatest idea,"" said Armstrong, whose state borders Manitoba and Saskatchewan. ""Canada is a proud country. We ought to respect that relationship. I hope the people of Canada know that is not how most Americans feel,"" said Beshear. He is concerned retaliatory tariffs could damage his state's bourbon industry, but noted its biggest exports to the north are aerospace and automotive products. Trump stood firm on his plan for tariffs and making Canada the 51st state in a dinner speech to Republican governors Thursday night. Houston, a Progressive Conservative, was there in his red team Canada jersey. There were few 51st state jokes, he said at a downtown hotel where the governors are meeting to discuss bipartisan national issues. With Ford's lead in public opinion polls apparently narrowing, he is eager to back up his campaign premise that he would be better than Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie and NDP Leader Marit Stiles to handle the tariff threat that could devastate Ontario's and Canada's economies while putting millions of American jobs at risk. He met with the governors of New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Georgia, West Virginia and Nebraska as well as Canadian Ambassador Kirsten Hillman. Ford told the Star New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is interested in Ontario's development of small modular nuclear reactors to meet the state's carbon-free electricity needs. It was his second Washington lobbying trip in just over a week. Opposition leaders have mocked Ford's claims he is best to fight Trump tariffs after a hot-mic gaffe early in the campaign where he told people he ""100 per cent"" supported Trump to win a second term as president despite his campaign promises of tariffs. In Etobicoke, where she was touting a platform that adds $9 billion in new spending to build schools and improve access to family doctors, Crombie mocked Ford's latest D.C. trip. ""Another photo opportunity (with) low-level advisers?"" said Crombie, maintaining the Tory leader should be home fighting the $189-million snap election he triggered instead of waiting until the next scheduled vote in June 2026. Later in a meeting with the Toronto Star editorial board, Crombie said Ford should be more worried about the 2.5 million Ontarians that don't have a family doctor than glad-handing in Washington. Meanwhile, the Liberals parted ways with candidate Viresh Bansal in Oshawa over concerns about a homophobic comment and hateful remarks about Sikhs. The riding has been held by New Democrat Jennifer French since 2014. The New Democrats released the party's full platform that contained about $70 billion in new spending over the next three years. The spending would go toward a grocery rebate, boosting the number of doctors, and building affordable housing with an additional $830 million over 10 years for school capital improvements. To help offset those costs, an NDP government would raise income taxes on people earning more than $300,000 a year, impose a ""luxury tax"" on residences costing $3 million or more and treat capital gains as income.

Experts weigh in on Ford's 401 tunnel:   The Star asked transit professionals about PC leader's idea to improve GTA traffic,2025.0,"Doug Ford's tunnel vision has no off-ramp. Amid scorn from political rivals, and warnings from transportation experts, the leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives is adamant that, if re-elected premier Feb. 27, his government will tunnel road lanes, and possibly a transit line, under at least 50 kilometres of Highway 401. Ford says the tunnel would span Toronto and extend west to Brampton, but has offered few other details, saying his party is awaiting a feasibility study to know the potential cost and construction timeline. What Ford says he does know is that drivers like the idea. ""The easiest way to know if someone commutes on the 401, ask them what they think about building a tunnel,"" Ford said recently. ""These hard-working families, they just want to get to work, get to soccer practice after work, get home, without the headache of bumper-to-bumper traffic from one end of the 401 to the other."" At Monday's leader debate, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie launched a blistering attack on what she called ""a fantasy project"" that will take 40 years to build, do nothing to alleviate congestion and ""bankrupt the province."" Some observers think the estimated tunnel cost could be as much $120 billion, which would gobble so much of the province's capital budget that it would be a non-starter. Sometimes, politically, it doesn't matter. John Tory campaigned for mayor of Toronto in 2014 promising SmartTrack, a ""surface subway"" using existing rail lines, that engaged voters and helped him get elected - but now barely exists. The Star asked three transit experts - Shoshanna Saxe, a civil engineer and infrastructure expert at U of T; Murtaza Haider, an expert in the economics and cities and regions who is research director of the Urban Analytics Institute; and Matti Siemiatycki, director of the U of T's Infrastructure Institute - key questions about Ford's tunnel vision. (Some answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.) 1. Based on what we know, how long do you think such a tunnel would take and how much could it cost? Saxe It would take a decade or longer to do ground investigation, design the tunnel and then build it. It's possible that even if we were really gung-ho about it, it would open in the 2040s. At the moment, it's a fictional project so there's a lot of uncertainty. It would cost tens of billions of dollars but you need to plan it out and, at this point, it's just a thing Doug Ford has talked about. Haider The construction of a tunnel spanning 60 kilometres or more - connecting Mississauga and Brampton in the west to Scarborough or beyond in the east - would likely face prohibitive financial and temporal challenges. Preliminary cost estimates for tunnelling in urban environments range from $250 million to over $1 billion per kilometre, though precise figures remain speculative without geotechnical surveys, environmental assessments and feasibility studies. Timelines for such megaprojects are inherently uncertain ... A fully underground tunnel accommodating both automotive and transit traffic could span decades to complete. Siemiatycki I wouldn't even try to estimate this because whatever I say, the tunnel is going to take longer and cost more. You could do an internal cost estimate, where you take all the details of the project and build it bottom up, or you could benchmark it relative to the cost-per-kilometre to build other similar projects around the world. Either way, we're into the tens of billions of dollars and above. Toronto is a high-cost jurisdiction - our transit projects are costing $1.5 billion per kilometre. 2. If a tunnel is built under Highway 401 spanning the city and beyond, would it eventually make car commuting faster and if so by how much? Saxe No, it won't make car commuting faster. For nearly 100 years, we've checked if adding road miles speeds up how fast people get to drive. Sometimes it does for a couple of years, but within five years everyone's back to driving the same speed as before - there's just more people stuck in traffic. It's also unclear if Ford wants to build a bypass, where you have to go one end to the other, or with entrances and exits that add congestion because it slows people down. Most people driving that stretch of Highway 401 are stopping somewhere between those 50 kilometres. Haider The proposed tunnel aims to address unmet travel demand generated by decades of population growth and socioeconomic activity that existing road and transit networks cannot fully accommodate. While the tunnel would enhance throughput capacity - moving more people and vehicles during peak periods - its impact on reducing travel times across congested corridors like Highway 401 is expected to be marginal. Capacity expansion should be framed as a mechanism to absorb latent demand (travel not currently realized due to constraints) rather than a solution to congestion. Failure to address latent demand risks exacerbating gridlock and stifling economic productivity. Siemiatycki Anyone commuting now - this tunnel project is not going to solve your commute, this is a decades-long project. You will very likely be retired by the time this is completed. That aside, what we've found with these big highway projects is that they solve the project in the short term, because they do add capacity, but they shift the bottlenecks to elsewhere in the network. 3. How much disruption would tunnel digging create? Is it possible to dig underneath without impacting traffic on the busy highway above? Saxe Technically it is possible to dig with very little interaction at the surface. However, do we want any entrances or exits or air valves? Construction of them would cause disruption and traffic during tunnel construction. Given Ford is talking about building right under Highway 401, I'm guessing there would be a lot of traffic impacts above for a long time. Haider A project of this scale would necessitate extensive engineering interventions, including large-scale earth removal, soil disposal, and logistical co-ordination of heavy machinery and labour. Numerous access and egress points would compound disruptions to surface-level traffic and adjacent land uses, potentially persisting throughout the multidecade construction period. Historical precedents, such as Boston's ""Big Dig"" - which saw costs escalate from $2 billion to $20 billion - highlight risks of budgetary overruns and scope creep, underscoring the need for cautious fiscal and operational planning. Siemiatycki They can tunnel underneath it but, just like with the ongoing subway digging projects, the dirt has to come out somewhere. With a project of this scale there is going to be a huge amount of earth that will need to be trucked away somewhere. All of those trucks create their own traffic and congestion, as well as safety concerns as we've seen with Ontario Line trucks. Even if you're digging underground, it's never impact-free above. 4. If Toronto has multi-billions of dollars to spend on reducing gridlock and commute times, what is the most effective use of those dollars? Saxe The absolute most effective thing would be to invest in much better public transit. In the short term, more bus rapid transit (BRT, in dedicated lanes) and many more bike lanes can help reduce gridlock. In the long term, you can invest in more commuter rail transit. Something that wouldn't cost money, but would reduce gridlock, is better zoning and land-use planning to ensure growing communities are oriented to transit so those residents don't have to drive everywhere. Haider A more pragmatic approach to enhancing regional mobility lies in prioritizing high-capacity bus rapid transit systems. Elevated BRT corridors, operating along Highway 401's median with articulated buses in platooned formations, could provide dedicated right-of-way at a fraction of tunnelling costs. Such systems could integrate with existing transit networks via underground interchanges or elevated pedestrian bridges, as exemplified by elevated rail-pedestrian linkages in New York City. Siemiatycki We are tunnelling now for public transit. Part of the reason projects are expensive here is we try to put many of them underground, in some cases where it's not the right tool. If I had tens of billions of dollars I would continue to invest in public transit and, as that transit comes online, add road tolls as a way to manage construction. I would also immediately add a bus lane to make commuting that way much quicker.

"Health care, housing key priorities for candidates in Windsor-Tecumseh; Ontario Election Incumbent Dowie captured riding for PC party in 2022 with nearly half the total vote",2025.0,"The riding of Windsor-Tecumseh can trace its roots back to a 1996 merger of pieces of the former ridings of Windsor-Riverside and Windsor-Walkerville to create Windsor-St. Clair. In 2007, Windsor-St. Clair became Windsor-Tecumseh and contains all of Tecumseh and the Windsor neighbourhoods of Riverside, portions of Walkerville and Sandwich South. The riding has 122,798 residents based on the 2021 Census count. Windsor-Tecumseh also contains much of the area's emerging economic might, being home to a large collection of tool and mould-making companies and the new $6-billion NextStar Energy plant. It hosts Windsor Airport, which will see significant industrial development on the airport lands and Sandwich South. The region's new acute-care hospital will also be located in the riding. The riding's voting preferences have evolved from being overwhelming supportive of the Liberals' Dwight Duncan (1995 to 2013), followed by even more staunch support for the NDP's Percy Hatfield (2013 to 2022), and then Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario MPP Andrew Dowie, who won the seat with nearly half the total vote (46 per cent) in 2022. The NDP's Gemma Grey-Hall was the 2022 runner-up (30 percent), followed by Liberal Gary Kaschak (14 per cent). Turnout in 2022 was 38,779 out of a possible 94,976 voters, a decline of 7.2 per cent over the 2018 election. Dowie and Grey-Hall, both running again in the riding, will be joined in this year's race by Liberal Connor Logan, the Green Party's Roxanne Tellier, Communist Party's Kyle Ford and New Blue's Sophia Sevo, who also ran in 2022. The following is a synopsis of each candidate's reasons for running and their priorities for the riding. Note: PC candidate Andrew Dowie and the Greens' Roxanne Tellier didn't return multiple requests from the Windsor Star for a phone interview or emailed responses to questions. The New Blue Party's Sophia Sevo and Ontario Party's Steven Gifford entered the race too late to be included here. GEMMA GREY-HALL, Ontario New Democratic Party Occupation: Senior development officer, University of Windsor Faculty of Science Reason for running: ""I think it's imperative we have a government fighting for what people need and what matters most to them. I'm not seeing that with our current Doug Ford government. ""I've been speaking to a growing body of people who are also deeply unhappy with the state of our health care, education. And we're still waiting for our hospital."" Priorities: ""Health care is at top of the list. We need to ensure we're using our dollars to support our health care system by funding it appropriately. ""Next, it's fighting the tariffs. You need to elect a government that's focused on providing people with what they need when times are dire. We know we're facing a current and ongoing threat from the American government regarding tariffs."" CONNOR LOGAN, Ontario Liberal Party Occupation: Constituency assistant for member of Parliament Irek Kusmierczyk (L Windsor Tecumseh) Reason for running: ""I've seen the issues with health care. I don't have a family doctor. ""Housing, I can't afford to buy a home and there's many people my age (23) and even in their 30s who are struggling to find a home. ""I also see the issues of education and the cuts to programs that are important to students. Our education system is seemingly breaking at the seams."" Priorities: ""We need to get the mega hospital built. There are people sitting for hours in emergency rooms and hallways of hospitals. ""There are also people waiting at walk-in clinics for hours. We need more investment there. We need more family doctors. ""We also need to build affordable homes. To do this we're going to scrap some of the taxes (development charges) that have been put up by previous governments that will end up saving $170,000 on a home. ""With education, we'll cut interest rates on OSAP (Ontario Student Assistance Program), so that will help students as well."" KYLE FORD, Communist Party of Canada (Ontario) Occupation: Mould maker Reason for running: ""I feel the time is getting right for people to reconsider the economic system we're living in. Running is the way to raise the party's profile and get a chance to get our voice in government and combat the Conservative and Liberal talking points raised, the anti-worker legislation that has been passed and put a voice for the working people in Parliament."" Priorities: ""Number one is addressing the cost-of-living crisis. It has made life difficult for everyone. ""In addition to that is supporting workers' rights. There are a lot of working-class people in the riding. ""If they're living paycheque to paycheque, the risk from corporations pulling out of the area or layoffs and restructuring in economic times like this is a real risk for workers.

Poilievre not suited to lead responsibly,2025.0,"When I moved to Canada in 1978, I was proud to live in John Diefenbaker's Prince Albert, Sask., riding. A spellbinding orator, Dief the Chief was a human-rights champion, and a defence lawyer who became a Progressive Conservative prime minister. These days, the best the Conservatives can offer is Pierre Poilievre, a career pol- itician who talks in slogans. Like U.S. President Donald Trump, he wants to ""drill, baby, drill,"" reduce taxes on the rich and slash foreign aid. In 20 years, he voted against the environment 400 times. Last year, he said Canada felt broken. This year's slogan is ""Canada First."" Can we trust him to lead Canada through the most serious crisis in our history? As a member of SCAN (Seniors for Climate Action Now), I want a trustworthy leader, someone who stands up to Trump and has the skills to grow an environmentally responsible economy and control inflation.

Concerns rise over plans to shut Ontario drug-use sites:   Doug Ford says a PC government will create 27 addiction recovery treatment hubs,2025.0,"Medical professionals in Ontario are warning that overburdened emergency rooms will be further strained should closings of supervised drug-use sites take effect by the end of next month. The provincial plan to shutter supervised drug-use sites, where individuals can use unregulated substances in the presence of trained workers who can respond to overdoses if needed, was ordered by Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s government last year. The legislature passed the Safer Streets, Stronger Communities Act in December. It prevents municipalities from applying directly to the federal government to open any new drug-use sites and prohibits any of them located within 200 metres of schools and child-care centres. The plan will result in 10 of the province’s 23 sites being shuttered. The decision drew ire from health advocates who fear the closings could lead to additional fatalities in an opioid crisis that killed more than 2,500 people in Ontario in 2023. In response to the criticism, Mr. Ford has defended his government’s intentions and has called supervised drug-use sites the “worst thing that could ever happen to a community.” The closings now appear to be moving closer to reality. Publicopinion polls show that Mr. Ford’s party has a strong chance of returning to power when Ontarians head to the polls next Thursday. This has contributed to heightened concerns about the fallout for the health care system and staff who are already overwhelmed by demands. Erin Ariss, a registered nurse and provincial president of the Ontario Nurses’ Association, said Thursday that her union is alarmed about the prospect of supervised drug-use sites closing. The decision will place vulnerable individuals at greater risk, she said. “Some will die of overdoses in the community, many others will be taken to already-overburdened emergency departments,” Ms. Ariss said in an e-mailed statement to The Globe and Mail. “This will further overwhelm hospitals that are already struggling with patient caseloads.” ONA and other organizations representing health care professionals issued a joint statement last year voicing their strong opposition to the government’s announcement. Toronto Public Health warned in January that a reduction in services poses “a significant risk of increased overdose deaths” because the alternative to supervised drug-use sites is for people to use drugs alone in potentially unsafe environments. It noted how sites are located in neighbourhoods that see a high volume of calls to paramedics about suspected opioid overdoses. The shuttering of supervised drug-use sites has come up in the context of the provincial election campaign, such as during a debate held in Northern Ontario. But it has not been a central focus of the race. Mr. Ford has largely tried to pitch voters on his belief that he is best suited to respond to U.S. tariffs and President Donald Trump. At a media event held in Clarence-Rockland, located east of Ottawa, on Wednesday, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said supervised drug-use sites are needed, but they should not be located “anywhere near schools or daycares, playgrounds, frankly even on main streets affecting business.” Ms. Crombie, who has been public about her biological father’s struggles with addiction, did not provide specifics when asked where she believed they could in fact be located. “It’s not easy to find the right location, but it is necessary,” she said. Harm-reduction strategies have received growing political scrutiny in Canada, including over the issue of safety. Ontario’s plans to close the sites were announced in the aftermath of the death of a 44-year-old mother hit by a stray bullet outside the South Riverdale Community Health Centre in east Toronto in 2023. The province’s decision echoes an approach taken in Alberta in 2021 in response to similar concerns. Federally, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has promised to yank funding from the sites, which he calls “drug dens.” He has said he would instead direct money to addiction-recovery programs if his party forms government after the next federal election. Mr. Ford has announced that his party is pursuing a different approach: the creation of 27 addiction recovery treatment hubs. Health Minister Sylvia Jones said last month that the hubs will provide access to mental-health support, addictions care, primary care, supportive housing and employment services. Advocates for supervised druguse sites have pointed to internal government reports highlighting that the sites are crucial for preventing deaths. When asked about these reports, Ms. Jones has said: “We’re listening to parents; we’re listening to individuals who have had to deal with this on a day-to-day basis.” With reports from Laura Stone","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Kirkup, Kristy",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 21, 2025",Emergency medical care; Drug overdose; Fatalities; Addictions; Narcotics; Shutdowns; Harm reduction; Drug use,,2025-02-21,The Globe and Mail

Crombie slams Ford over attacks:   Liberal leader accuses PC leader of slinging 'mud' and ducking public events as election nears,2025.0,"Doug Ford is riding high and laying low. With the Progressive Conservative leader - who polls suggest is the front-runner in the Feb. 27 election - ducking public events for days, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie came out swinging Wednesday. ""They want to sling mud,"" Crombie told reporters in Rockland, near Ottawa, referring to PC attacks against her. ""If Doug Ford has something to say to me, he should have the balls to say it to my face,"" she said. ""That's what I'm saying to him right now. You got something to complain about? Come to me. Show your face. Where's he been? He called an early unnecessary election at the cost of $189 million, he's been absent for 50 per cent of it,"" said the Liberal chief. ""Where has he been? Where is he today? He's been absent and that's taking voters for granted. That is disrespectful. Show your face and be accountable for your record."" Ford has had no public events since Monday's televised leaders' debate at the CBC Broadcast Centre. The Tory was the only leader to skip the post-debate press conferences with reporters. He also dodged journalists following the northern issues debate in North Bay last Friday. After Monday's plane crash at Pearson airport caused flight delays, his campaign abandoned plans for a two-day swing through Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury and Thunder Bay. While he was in Niagara on Wednesday, his campaign itinerary was kept secret and no events were open to the media. Later in the day, Ford posted on social media about his private tours of two businesses there, where he talked ""about how a re-elected PC government will protect Ontario workers and stand up for our province."" He is expected to meet with reporters on Thursday before flying to Washington the next day. It will be his second campaign swing to the U.S. capital to lobby against President Donald Trump's threatened 25 per cent tariffs that would devastate Ontario's trade-dependent economy. While the PC chief was staying out of public view, his campaign was on the attack, taking aim at Liberal and New Democratic candidates for past transgressions in a bid to keep his rivals on their toes. Andrea Lawlor, a political science professor at McMaster University, said with his lead in the polls, ""no news is good news"" for Ford in the final week before election day. ""He does fairly well in campaigns, but he is also prone to making slip-ups and he's made a few in this campaign,"" said Lawlor, referring to the Tory's high-profile gaffes about being ""100 per cent"" happy Donald Trump won the U.S. election and musing about the death penalty for criminals. ""His team will be interested in, as much as possible, to locking him down and prevent the opportunity for those types of slip-ups to occur and ride the continued public opinion wave all the way to an electoral victory,"" she said. Indeed, the most recent Abacus Data survey for the Star, which was conducted before the debate, found Ford's Tories with 41 per cent support compared to Crombie's Liberals at 28 per cent, Stiles's New Democrats at 21 per cent and Mike Schreiner's Greens at six per cent. That was a five percentage point drop for the Tories and a four percentage point increase for the Liberals since the previous Abacus survey released Feb. 7. Abacus surveyed 1,500 Ontarians from last Thursday through Saturday using online panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. While opt-in polls cannot be assigned a margin of error, for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have one of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Ford was not the only leader with no public campaign events on Wednesday. Stiles was doing a series of broadcast interviews across the province as her New Democrats aim to shore up support. ""Doug Ford is in hiding,"" the NDP leader told Richard Southern of 680 News. ""He's unwilling to defend his record. He's hoping he can get away with that. He's hoping people just won't go out and vote,"" she said. The Green leader, meanwhile, was in Georgetown, promising a break in employer health taxes to help small businesses cope with challenges like inflation and high rent increases that have forced some to move away from long-standing locations for cheaper premises. ""Small businesses struggle,"" Schreiner told supporters.

Clock ticking for Singh to seize the moment; Rethink urged on poilievre as biggest threat,2025.0,"After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be pre- pared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Quebecois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - en - suring the Liberals' survival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pact with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change. ""When you're defining your op - ponent, it is vitally important for it to be a critique that has an impact on the voter themselves,"" he says. ""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth."" Singh has been calling for Parliament to be recalled to pass a support package for workers and other Canadians who could be hurt by Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity. But with the possibility of an election call before that, Singh may have lost his chance.

Our conservative legacy; Macdonald and mulroney showed us the way,2025.0,"Sir John A. Macdonald and Brian Mulroney were two great prime ministers who helped make Canada into a magnificent country that we call home. Despite their apparent contradictions, reconciling their legacies is how Canada moves forward under a new, Conservative prime minister. Macdonald led the infant Dominion's first government in 1867, and he remains the second-longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Of the Fathers of Confederation, he was the first among equals. Macdonald's National Policy of high tariffs and his belief in railways as a nation-building tool laid the foundations for a strong and independent Canada. For him, there was no greater threat to Canada than the creep of the United States, and his life's work was ensuring that our country was not snuffed out in its infancy. The fact that Canada managed to expand from sea to sea, let alone survive in the wake of Manifest Destiny is nothing short of providential in its own right. Safeguarding the ongoing integrity of the country is a first-order priority for any government. In 1988, more than a century after Confederation, Brian Mulroney led a more mature and secure Canada into free trade with the U.S. He also firmly reoriented the country with the democratic West during the Cold War, after years of Pierre Trudeau's rapprochement and vacillation with the communist bloc. By signing the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement that swiftly evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mulroney cemented our comparative advantage of sharing a border with the U.S. As a result, Canadians have a better standard of living and a healthier economy. The nearly four decades of North American free trade were great years of rising material wealth and comfort that strengthened Canada and the well-being of its people. It is Mulroney's greatest legacy, and there should be Ino reactive revisionism about that due to U.S. President Donald Trump's belligerence and aggression. Free trade is still worth striving for. Canada relies upon it as a resource exporter and an importer of manufactured foreign goods. If the U.S. is retreating from continental free trade, Canada must look for new partners to fill the gaps. We should only do so in a principled fashion, and resist the temptation to expand our commercial ties with bad actors like China. There is no moral high ground to be gained by becoming friends with the 21st century's worst totalitarian states. A strong and independent Canada would be a major roadblock to the geographic domination sought by Russia and China in the Arctic and Indo-Pacific. They are already making incursions and flyovers into the north, and that territory must remain firmly Canadian. Fortifying and building up the Arctic is the next great frontier of Canadian history, and is as important now as the railways were at the end of the 19th century. At this point, Trump's threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st state are more of a rhetorical irritant than a military threat, but it should be the motivation to create a Canada that stands on its own two feet without a helping hand. There is Ino greater way to uphold Macdonald's legacy than to ensure the country he brought into existence does not disappear from the Earth. Fighting against the internal subversive forces that have been waging war on his legacy should be another goal for Conservatives. Once the most honoured prime minister in Canadian history, Macdonald has been all but erased from the public space by vandals and cast as a villain by the federal government. To restore his legacy, however, the Liberals must be clobbered by the Conservatives in the upcoming general election. Macdonald and Mulroney excelled at this, and it will be a satisfying way to emulate both of them. A new Canadian era will be ushered in by finally seeing off the Trudeau Liberals, and banishing their ghoulish great white hope Mark Carney into an opulent exile in New York or London. Their decade at the top has been disastrous: Canadians are poorer and Canada is a more expensive place to live, with national pride among younger Canadians lagging badly. A country whose youth have no hope for the future, has Ino future. A terminal government whose primary motivation is keeping their jobs cannot be trusted to safeguard the country, let alone improve it So much will have changed since the last Conservative government if they return to power. The assumptions held in 2015 for the future of Canada, North America and the world have been uprooted and tossed aside. To reclaim the pride of being a secure, sovereign, and strong country, Canada must first recover from this lost decade of mediocrity-turned-misery. There is no better way to accomplish that than rebuilding our military, removing the petty restraints shackled upon our economy by bad government policies and aggressively seeking free trade with friendly countries overseas. Canada has no great political philosophers, and the visions and thoughts of the prime ministers continue to redefine and shape our politics more than anyone else. Despite being two towering figures of Canadian conservatism, the legacies of Macdonald and Mulroney may seem difficult to reconcile. Macdonald's National Policy and Mulroney's continentalism are things of the past, but what they both sought, above all, was national strength through independence and partnerships. A friendly White House is no longer a guarantee, and with new leadership at the helm, this era is the next stage of Canada's national evolution.

At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pact with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change. ""When you're defining your op - ponent, it is vitally important for it to be a critique that has an impact on the voter themselves,"" he says. ""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth."" Singh has been calling for Parliament to be recalled to pass a support package for workers and other Canadians who could be hurt by Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity.

Greenbelt scandal hangs over Ford as Ontario election nears:   The PC Leader is sending voters to the polls during probe into his government’s aborted plan to develop the protected area,2025.0,"It was a stark reminder of a controversy that is not going away: During an election debate on Monday, the moderator asked Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford whether he would allow housing on the province’s protected Greenbelt. Mr. Ford bluntly acknowledged he had broken his promise not to touch the ecologically sensitive zone. After allowing select developers to build homes in parts of the protected area, his government scrapped the project amid a political furor in 2023. “I apologized to the people. We’re moving forward. We’re building homes,” he said during the leaders’ debate. As much as Mr. Ford tries to steer away from his Greenbelt misstep, he had little choice on Monday but to confront the issue. In calling an early election, Mr. Ford is sending Ontario voters to the polls during a criminal investigation into his government’s aborted decision to open up parts of the protected lands for development. Mr. Ford has said he called the Feb. 27 election because he needs a new mandate from voters to protect Ontario from the economic uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. But opposition leaders say the RCMP probe is a key reason Mr. Ford called a snap election 15 months before the next scheduled vote. “I think there’s no question that the timing of this election is absolutely connected to Doug Ford, not only just trying to escape his own record, but trying to outrun this RCMP criminal investigation that’s under way,” NDP Leader Marit Stiles said in an interview. Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie also said Mr. Ford’s snap election call is an attempt to get in front of any charges resulting from the Mounties’ probe. “It’s clear to me that he’s trying to outrun an RCMP investigation,” she said in an interview. The RCMP said in an e-mail that it is conducting a thorough investigation but did not answer questions because of the continuing probe. Constable Beau Gavin, who is one of the investigators, also declined comment. Police officers interviewed several current and former Premier’s Office staffers last summer in Toronto. Investigators asked questions about the decision-making and cabinet-approval processes for the Greenbelt plan, according to an individual with knowledge of one interview. The Globe and Mail agreed not to name the person so they could speak about an active police investigation. The RCMP’s sensitive and international investigations unit is investigating allegations associated with the government’s decision to open parts of the Greenbelt for development, the force confirmed in October, 2023. Mr. Ford has long faced controversy over his Greenbelt plans. During the 2018 election campaign, the Liberal Party circulated a video of Mr. Ford saying he would hand a “big chunk” of the area to developers. After an outcry, he promised not to touch the 800,000-hectare arc of protected farmland and countryside around the Greater Toronto Area. Then, in the fall of 2022, Mr. Ford’s government announced plans to carve out areas of the Greenbelt for housing development. Media outlets, including The Globe, have reported that some of the properties identified for removal had changed hands after Mr. Ford was first elected in 2018 and, in one case, less than two months before the plan was announced – prompting questions from opposition politicians whether some developers were tipped off. Ontario’s Integrity Commissioner and then-auditor-general concluded in reports released in the summer of 2023 that political staff had driven a process that discarded environmental and infrastructure criteria and favoured certain developers, who stood to gain $8.3-billion in increased property values. Some of the developers had ties to the PC Party. At a campaign stop earlier this month, Mr. Ford told reporters that he has not been interviewed by the Mounties and did not know whether any of his staff had been either. “What I have said is let’s co-operate 1,000 per cent because we did nothing wrong,” he said. Mr. Ford’s spokeswoman, Grace Lee, did not address a question from The Globe about opposition accusations that Mr. Ford called an early election to outrun the police investigation. Instead, she reiterated that Mr. Ford has not been contacted by the RCMP. The Greenbelt scandal and police investigation do not appear to be hindering the popularity of Mr. Ford’s PC Party, which has a double-digit lead in public opinion polls. “I think that it’s certainly not a top-of-mind issue for most Ontarians,” said Lydia Miljan, a political science professor at the University of Windsor. Prof. Miljan said one reason the RCMP’s Greenbelt investigation hasn’t stuck to Mr. Ford could be because the force has not released updates. “When the police are investigating, they don’t say much. So it’s not like we’re getting daily revelations,” she said. “It’d be different if, for example, there was a court case going on and that way people would be following a trial. The fact is that we don’t know what the police have found.” With a report from Robyn Doolittle","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Mahoney, Jill",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 19, 2025",Criminal investigations; Scandals; Voters; Politics; Interviews; Debates; Decision making,,2025-02-19,The Globe and Mail
Clock ticking for singh to seize the moment; Rethink urged on Poilievre as biggest threat,2025.0,"After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be prepared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Québécois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - ensuring the Liberals' sur - vival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016.

"Election debates cancelled amid lack of participants, PC candidates' boycott",2025.0,"All-candidates debates in three local ridings that were to be organized by the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce for the upcoming provincial election have been cancelled. Ryan Donally, the chamber's president and chief executive officer, said one party had declined to take part in the debates while some candidates had yet to be chosen. Only one party out of the three local ridings had fielded complete slates for the debates. ""Two of the parties had only submitted one candidate for us and one of the parties had informed us that they were choosing not to participate in local debates."" A source with knowledge of the debates said the party that declined to join was the Progressive Conservatives. Eligible parties include all those who have representation at Queen's Park - the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, the NDP and the Green Party. ""We're not in a position that we felt that it was OK to put a single candidate up on stage to essentially debate against nobody,"" he said. The affected ridings for the debates are Windsor West, Windsor-Tecumseh and Essex. ""The integrity of what we were going to be able to put on stage at that time ... was not going to be good,"" said Donally. The chamber was set to hold all three debates Feb. 19 at the Serbian Centre, which would be broadcast on YourTV/Windsor local cable television. The format will now move to pre-recorded fireside chats, he said. There was also fairly low registration to attend the debates. ""The registration was extremely low for a not-for-profit. We need to look at every event and see if we have the ability to at least come close to breaking even. And we were looking at a significant financial loss."" The chamber had to secure a date and make a decision earlier this week on whether to hold the debates, Donally said. Cable television also had to make arrangements for the debates. Waiting until later in the election - set for Feb. 27 - wasn't an option considering the logistics of both the chamber and local cable television, he said. Other chambers, which typically hold all-candidate debates in ridings throughout Ontario, have also cancelled debates, Donally said. ""We're not the first chamber to move away from doing traditional debates into different formats. And not just this year. They have happened in the past."" Lisa Gretzky, the NDP candidate for Windsor West, said in an email she was ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the cancelled debates. ""I was looking forward to speaking to voters on how an NDP government would support businesses and workers during this unprecedented time,"" she said. Donally said the chamber plans to hold all-candidates debates for the next federal election. ""We look forward to seeing a full slate of candidates so we can put on a high-quality debate for both the people in person and the audiences at home to get to know them."" In Windsor-Tecumseh the registered candidates are Andrew Dowie for the PCs, Kyle Ford for the Communist Party, Steven Gifford for the Ontario Party, Gemma Grey-Hall for the NDP, Sophia Sevo for the New Blue Party and Roxanne Tellier for the Greens. In Windsor West registered candidates are Mark Dewdney for the None of the Above Direct Democracy Party, Tony Francis for the PCs, Matthew Giancola for the Ontario Party, Lisa Gretzky for the NDP, Joshua Griffin for the New Blue Party and Nick Kolasky for the Greens.

Clock ticking for singh to seize the moment; Rethink urged on Poilievre as biggest threat,2025.0,"After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be prepared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Québécois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - ensuring the Liberals' sur - vival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pac t with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change. ""When you're defining your opponent, it is vitally important for it to be a critique that has an impact on the voter themselves,"" he says. ""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth."" Singh has been calling for Parliament to be recalled to pass a support package for workers and other Canadians who could be hurt by Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity.

Poilievre has excelled at taking people down. Can he lift people up?,2025.0,"About 20 years ago, I worked with a team of speech writers in the Ontario Cabinet Office that wrote for whoever was sitting premier, as well as various senior public servants. We sent up multiple speeches per day for different personalities, sometimes writing for two of them on the same day. In speech writing, matching tone to the speaker is everything. If the speaker reads a draft that they feel doesn't sound like them, it's sent back for a rewrite. So, we came up with personas characterizing the different personalities to remind us of their speaking style. There was a John Wayne (giddy up, stoic certainty). We had a Jimmy Stewart (empathetic, belief in community), a Hillary Clinton (calm, rational explainer). A couple of those references are a bit dated. Like I said, it was a while ago. And these weren't taken literally. People are unique and complicated, and every audience has different needs. But the comparison to these figures helped when editing a speech before sending it up the line. Did ""John Wayne"" have any $10 words? Would ""Hillary Clinton"" come off as too glib? Those personas weren't adopted quickly out of political convenience. They were a guide to the leader's core beliefs. They spoke to deeply held values and world view. A ""John Wayne"" voice, for example, speaks to a belief in individual self-reliance. A ""Jimmy Stewart"" believes in the inherent goodness of people, even those who may hold differing views. I've been thinking about these personas in watching federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre adjust to the rapidly shifting mood among Canadians in response to the tariff threat. Until recently, to my ear, Poilievre brought to mind a Trump-lite tone, one that speaks more to self-interest and superiority. Poilievre has described Canada as a place where ""everything is broken."" When mayors in Quebec and Montreal disagreed with his housing plan, they were called ""incompetent."" There was the speech he gave about one year ago to the Vancouver Board of Trade where he told business leaders that their lobbyists in Ottawa were ""utterly useless"" and that they should ""stop sucking up to the people who are doing the damage to our country."" Brutish language. Simple absolutes. Us and them. Poilievre's diction has been peppered with ""dismantle,"" ""defund,"" ""axe."" To be clear, Poilievre is not Trump. But his political identity was shaped in a global conservative ecosystem that rewards excessive rhetoric and mocks thoughtful discussion. The Trump-lite tone is cheered by his conservative base. His lead in the polls suggests that Poilievre's sense of grievance had been touching a nerve with moderate voters fatigued with a rising cost of living, housing affordability and homelessness, all while being led by a prime minister past his due date. Even many Liberal strategists would admit that Poilievre had a gift for communicating this brand, especially when speaking directly to Canadians via social media. But now that Canada is staring at the pointy end of conservative populism, Poilievre's Trump-lite tone will hit the ears of Canadians much differently, reminding them of threats to their finances and the very future of their nation. The angry mood Poilievre once tapped into is shifting to anxiety. Anger is an indulgence. Anxiety we feel in our gut. Poilievre and his advisers, of course, know this. And a change in his tone might have happened to some degree anyway, even without the tariff threat. Opposition leaders often adopt a more prime-minister-in-waiting tone to close out a campaign. But for Poilievre, the shift is happening overnight. There's an obvious, and hurried, attempt to appear calmer, more strategic and thoughtful. From the few podium appearances I've seen on news networks, he comes across as a bit wooden in the new persona - more reliance on notes, fewer changes in voice intonation, less engagement with the audience. So, for Poilievre, this is a deeper question that goes beyond speech writing. Who is the human being behind the public voice? What does he believe in? All we've seen him do well is to take people down. What can he say now to lift people up? Good speakers - and good leaders - get people believing in a future that does not yet exist, but which they can bring into existence, together. It's going to be a real challenge for Poilievre to shift his public speaking persona from ""everything is broken"" to ""we can do it."" Getting people angry is easy. Hope is hard work.

"Ford, Crombie spar on taxes, tunnel:   PC leader often on defensive during debate as rivals point to housing, affordability, Ontario Place",2025.0,"Sparks flew between Doug Ford and Bonnie Crombie as the four party leaders clashed in the live provincewide televised debate ahead of the Feb. 27 election. The Progressive Conservative leader repeatedly targeted the Liberal leader for her record as three-term Mississauga mayor. ""I almost fell off the stage, David, when Bonnie Crombie said she'll cut taxes,"" Ford told moderator David Common, the host of CBC Radio's ""Metro Morning."" ""My goodness, all she did was increase taxes in Mississauga,"" he said Monday night. But Crombie reminded Ford that he ""stood in the legislature and heaped praise on me and my record, said what a fantastic job creator I was and how the economy was booming in Mississauga. ""He may think differently today, but back when I was mayor he thought I was doing a pretty incredible job,"" said the Liberal leader, who mocked the Tory leader's scheme to build a tunnel underneath Highway 401 from Mississauga to Scarborough. ""Doug, a fantasy tunnel, how dumb is that? After seven years of lies why should anyone believe you. You make other promises, but you don't get it done,"" she said, circling back to pose a question to viewers watching from home. ""Is your life more affordable than it was seven years ago?"" Crombie asked. NDP Leader Marit Stiles said ""we cannot afford to continue on the road that we are on,"" pointing out that the cost of housing and groceries have all risen on Ford's watch. ""Rent in Ontario is up 38 per cent, right? Let that sink in: 38 per cent across the province on average since 2018 ... and it's not just in cities like Toronto, it's in every community across this province,"" said Stiles, noting homelessness has skyrocketed under the Tories and park encampments have mushroomed. ""Where is the housing, Doug? It's not being built,"" she said. ""Rising costs are really hurting a lot of people in this province and they are weakening us. He has left us weaker than ever before."" Stiles also pointed out ""the hallway health care crisis was invented by the previous Liberal government, but Doug Ford and his government have poured gasoline all over it."" Crombie, who has made the fact 2.5 million Ontarians lack a family doctor the cornerstone of her campaign, blamed Ford for failing on health care. ""We're in a crisis and you're bragging about what you've done. It's been abysmal,"" she said, pointing out that the Tories waited until just before the election ""to turn to a Liberal,"" Dr. Jane Philpott, a former federal health minister, to help fix the problem. Taking aim at Crombie, Stiles and Green Leader Mike Schreiner, Ford said ""each of them fail on the economy."" ""I know the three of you aren't very good with numbers,"" the Tory chief said dismissively. ""All you three believe in taxing people to death,"" he said, insisting ""the economy will go down the tubes"" unless the PCs win the Feb. 27 election. Schreiner, for his part, said Ford is only in it to help the wealthy. ""Unfortunately in Ontario right now, the rich insiders are getting richer and the rest of us are just struggling to get by,"" said the Green leader. Ford was frequently on the defensive with all three of his rivals attacking him for the controversial redevelopment of Ontario Place. While he remained calm for most of the debate, he struggled when the discussion turned to the $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap scandal, and his flip-flopping over allowing and then prohibiting development on 7,400 acres of protected land. ""I think I was pretty clear. I said I was. Then I wasn't, and I went ahead and did it. I apologized to the people,"" stammered Ford. While the RCMP's ongoing criminal investigation into the Greenbelt fiasco wasn't mentioned once in the 90-minute debate, Stiles was withering toward the PC leader. ""He says one thing in front of the camera and another thing behind closed doors. You can't trust him on this,"" said the New Democrat. Ford was also taken to task for being the multimillionaire scion of a rich family, though he maintained his ""very first job was when I was in Grade 2, delivering the Globe and Mail newspaper in the freezing cold weather at 5 a.m."" Crombie reminded viewers her early years were spent growing up in a rooming house with a single mother after her alcoholic father left the family. ""Unfortunately, Doug, you don't get the plight of real people because you were raised privileged, with a silver spoon in your mouth. You didn't have to work for anything. You had a company handed to you, Doug. So you don't understand how expensive things are today,"" she said. Bristling at his charge she favours the federal carbon tax when she rejected it as ""wrong"" in early December, Crombie said: ""I have said that repeatedly. But you're just like your friend Donald Trump, you make things up. You are saying lies."" Mindful that Ford has enjoyed a double-digit lead in public-opinion polls since he triggered the snap $189-million election three weeks ago - 15 months before a vote that had been scheduled for June 2026 - Stiles and Crombie at times appeared to be jockeying for second place. ""I was really shocked to see that the Liberal leader, her party, has received $25,000 in donations from private health-care insiders ... I'd like to know how she can stand here and say she's going to save health care ... when she's receiving these kind of donations,"" the New Democrat said. ""I think the NDP leader is envious of my fundraising effort to date,"" Crombie retorted, suggesting the New Democrat platform is not realistic. ""I will say that the NDP thinks that money grows on trees. You just can't promise everything to everyone all the time,"" she said before pleading with NDP voters to come to the Grits to stop the Tories. According to the latest Abacus Data survey for the Star, his Tories are at 41 per cent support, ahead of Crombie's Liberals at 28 per cent, Stiles's New Democrats at 21 per cent and Schreiner's Greens at six per cent. Ford, whose Tories have been in office since 2018, said he called the election early because he needs a four-year mandate to ""outlive and outlast"" Trump, whose threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods would devastate Ontario's economy.

Anti-abortion group backs PC leadership candidate Daudrich,2025.0,"Anti-abortion advocates are pushing for Manitobans 14 and older to buy a Progressive Conservative party membership and vote for leadership candidate Wally Daudrich. RightNow, a Toronto non-profit that works to nominate and elect pro-life politicians across Canada, is backing Daudrich. It said Fort Whyte MLA Obby Khan, the only other Manitoba PC leadership candidate, didn’t respond to its request for an interview. In an interview with RightNow that’s been posted online, Daudrich said there’s a lot the province could do to reduce the number of abortions and assisted-suicide deaths. He called for support programs for pregnant women: “No one should feel forced to have an abortion because of circumstances in their life.” Daudrich also said he’d ensure that assisted suicide “is not actively promoted” in Manitoba health facilities. Electing him may be Manitoba’s only chance to have a “pro-freedom, pro-life and true conservative” party leader “for years to come,” said Daudrich, who owns a lodge in Churchill. The business owner said one of the “first things” he would do would as premier would be to rescind Bill 8, the Abortion Protest Buffer Zone Act. The law, which took effect Feb. 1, prohibits protests, demonstrations or picketing around health centres that provide abortion services. Its goal is to protect patients and providers from harassment and intimidation, the province has said. “Bill 8, I think, contravenes some Canadian statutes because it is a free speech issue,” Daudrich told the Free Press . “The right to assemble and the right to protest — it’s being denied to certain segments of our population,” said the longtime party member who owns a home in Morden and met his wife while studying at a U.S. Bible college. Manitoba was one of the last provinces to impose abortion service buffer zones in Canada. “This is something that we have been pushing for, for well over a decade,” said Kemlin Nembhard, executive director of the Women’s Health Clinic in Winnipeg. “In many other provinces, this is just the normal course of action,” said Nembhard, who called Daudrich’s views on abortion “draconian.” “People have a right to receive care — and this is basic health care — without being threatened or harassed,” she said Friday. Daudrich said he’s not alone in opposing abortion and medically assisted suicide, and is not afraid to make it part of his election platform. “I think I’m just saying what everybody is thinking and my position is right of centre. It’s not extremist. It’s very, very nuanced and very, very balanced,” he said Friday. Nembhard said Daudrich’s comments and views on abortion are “bleeding” over the border from the U.S. She said she worries the rollback of reproductive rights there could roll into Canada “if we don’t speak out now and put the kibosh on it.” The PC leadership campaign, meanwhile, didn’t get rolling in the mind of the public until Daudrich started ramping up the right-wing rhetoric, said Chris Adams, a University of Manitoba political studies prof. “For the past two months, we’ve seen him take a certain stand on a lot of issues and the temperament of the campaign, too, is quite right of centre,” he said. “These positions are things that will mobilize evangelical Christians within the party as well as other people in the party who are concerned on these issues,” Adams said. “Pro-life Catholics, of course, will be happy to see this position taken — not all Catholics, I should say, but the pro-life activists,” he said. He said the positions are aimed at attracting support from party members — not voters. Daudrich and Khan — whose campaign did not respond to an interview request Friday — have been urging supporters to buy PC party memberships by Feb. 28 to be eligible to cast a ballot for the new leader, who will be announced on April 26. That leader has until the next election, due in 2027, to convince Manitobans to vote PC. “The party has to win the centrist urban voter in Winnipeg if they want to win government,” Adams said. “It’s one thing to win the leadership, it’s another thing to win the provincial electorate, particularly the urban electorate, and more than half of the seats in Manitoba are in the Winnipeg region.” carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 18, 2025",Leadership; Demonstrations & protests; Abortion; Pro life movement; Assisted suicide; Elections,,2025-02-18,Winnipeg Free Press
'We will never be 51st state'; POilievre warns trump not to turn canada into a 'resentful neighbour',2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has warned U.S. President Donald Trump not to turn a ""loyal friend into a resentful neighbour"" with incessant threats of tariffs on key sectors of the Canadian economy and making Canada the 51st state. Poilievre was speaking to hundreds of supporters at a ""Canada First"" rally on Saturday afternoon, to coincide with Flag Day, in the same downtown Ottawa convention centre where his leadership of the Conservative party began more than two years ago. ""Sometimes it does take a threat to remind us of what we have, what we could lose and what we could become,"" he told the crowd. ""The unjustified threats of tariffs and 51st statehood from Donald Trump have united our people to defend the country we love."" Speaking to Americans, Poilievre gave them two options. The first one would be to carry out an ""unprovoked attack"" on the Canadian economy with tariffs, making their consumers pay more, their workers earn less money, and make gas prices skyrocket. ""You will turn a loyal friend into a resentful neighbour, forced to match tariff with tariff and to seek friends everywhere else. Both our economies will weaken, leaving less money for defence and security, and our enemies will grow stronger,"" he said. Or, the second option would see Canada and the U.S. trade even more, he said, allowing consumers to pay less for goods and workers to have more money in their pockets. ""I would ask you this question: which other country would you rather have as your neighbour? If Canada is not your friend, who is?"" he asked. Poilievre said Canadians are nice and polite, slow to anger and quick to forgive. ""But never confuse our kindness with weakness,"" he said, prompting loud cheers from the crowd. ""Let me be clear: we will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country."" Poilievre also accused the Liberals, and especially their leadership contenders, of instrumentalizing the looming threat of tariffs to distract from their record. He said many of them are proving that Conservatives were ""right on everything."" ""Everyone now admits ... that Conservatives were right on the Liberal capital gains tax, that Conservatives were right on the carbon tax, on pipelines, on LNG, on fentanyl, the borders, immigration and the need to celebrate rather than cancel our proud history,"" he said. The rally was an exclamation mark on a broader message change by the Conservatives, which has seen them move away from earlier calls for a ""carbon tax election,"" to a campaign theme more in tune with the current moment, battling multiple threats from Trump. That did not stop Poilievre from attacking Mark Carney, seen as the front-runner to become Liberal leader, on his promise to ""change"" the consumer carbon tax. ""Mr. Carney will pause the carbon tax, hide it out of sight, so that you won't see it for the duration of the election period,"" said Poilievre. ""God forbid, if he were elected, he would bring in a much bigger tax that has no rebate whatsoever."" ""They will be popping the champagne at the Trump Tower when 'Carbon Tax Carney' comes in,"" he added. Poilie vre promised a ""patriotic tax cut"" for Canadians if he is elected prime minister and to axe the sales tax on new homes. He got some of the loudest cheers when promising to cut foreign aid to ""dictators and terrorist groups,"" bringing back Canadian symbols and figures such as Terry Fox in passports, and restoring in-person citizenship oaths but changing the words of the existing oath. Conservatives were hoping to make a big splash with the ""Canada First"" rally, but it was also a victim of its success. About 30 minutes before the start of the rally, the room was at capacity with 1,000 Conservative supporters showcasing their best red and white outfits, and another thousand watching in two overflow rooms. But there was still a long line of supporters spilling outside the venue, some of them angry or disappointed they were unable to get inside the main room or an overflow room. ""If they can't organize a rally, how the heck are they going to organize a country?"" asked Paul Touzin as he was leaving the venue, unable to get in. Liberals criticized Poilievre's shift in strategy, saying it was incoherent. ""You can't say that Canada is broken and at the same time say that Canada is the best country in the world,"" said Immigration Minister Marc Miller before the rally. ""The two just don't go together.""

"Tories on tightrope; Analysis Can poilievre balance affordability, u.s. tariffs?",2025.0,""" Canada First"" is Pierre Poilievre's new pitch to Canadians. it also represents But the firsts the Conservative leader himself has been navigating in the past few weeks. It's the first time as leader that he has faced off against the Liberals without Prime Minister Justin Trudeau planning to run in the next election. And U.S. President Donald Trump has dealt Poilievre another challenging first: Find a way to talk about affordability, an issue Poilievre has owned, without focusing it all on a ""carbon tax election,"" given that the threat of a trade war with the United States seems to be overwhelming Canadians' other economic concerns right now. Something else new for Poilievre is the Liberals' unpopularity seems to have bottomed out and, with Trudeau leaving, their support is creeping up in the polls after more than a year-and-a-half of consistently slipping further behind the Conservatives. But even though their world has been shaken, Conservatives are not hitting the panic button. At least not yet. A Conservative MP, who was granted anonymity in order to speak freely, acknowledged what most Conservatives think: they would definitely have preferred facing off against Trudeau in the forthcoming election, given the prime minister's deep unpopularity. Poilievre will be unveiling what he believes to be the message and the tone Canadians want to hear at a Canada First rally on Saturday, staged to coincide with the previously unloved Flag Day, in the same downtown Ottawa convention centre where his leadership of the party began more than two years ago. Leading up to the branding relaunch, National Post spoke with 17 Conservative insiders, veteran strategists, organizers, MPs and grassroots members to understand the challenges Poilievre faces and some of the party's thinking in reorienting his pitch. The main thing they said: it all starts with Trump. Shortly after Trump's victory in November, Poilievre made it clear he wasn't going to be part of Trudeau's so-called Team Canada approach against the president's growing threats of tariffs and taking over Canada. While trying to steer clear of comments that could inflame relations with an unpredictable American leader, Poilievre kept the pressure on Trudeau, accusing him of sending jobs south of the border and criticizing his handling of Trump's first term in office. But then Trudeau announced on Jan. 6 he was resigning and Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20. After that, Conservative thinking changed. ""It's just frustrating , Trump has consumed all oxygen, and Canadians are feed- ing it by panicking,"" said another Conservative MP, who was also granted anonymity. ""It's all people are talking about."" As Trump's threat to hit all Canadian goods with 25 per cent tariffs hovers like a storm cloud over the country, Poilievre tried in press conferences defending his call for an ""axe the tax election,"" despite everything else that was unfolding. ""Look, I'm not prime minister,"" he said when asked about making inroads with U.S. lawmakers. Inside the party, however, the debate was whether it was the right approach, and whether he needed to start facing the American issue head on. Especially as all the Liberal leadership contenders seemed to be signalling they weren't interested in defending Trudeau's consumer carbon tax. ""Pierre is normally ahead of the curve to identify issues that Canadians care about and leads on them. But I think on the flip side, he never wants to go off message. He very strongly believes in repetition,"" one insider said. The situation presented a challenge for Poilievre, who after more than a year dominating the political agenda in Ottawa, was now facing pressure to shift his message. ""I think Poilievre was too slow, he's catching on now, but he was too slow,"" said Peter Coleman, a longtime Conservative and president of the National Citizens Coalition, a grassroots, right-leaning group. One insider forcefully declared that the carbon-tax election message was ""dead."" Others said the party shouldn't rush its response in the midst of a volatile situation. Some also made the point that hindsight is always 20/20 and Poilievre was faced with a ""lose-lose"" situation. By early February, the mes- sage had sunk in. Poilievre needed to appear more serious about the gravity of the trade threats. He did not criticize Trudeau's announce - ment on retaliatory tariffs. At the same time, he swapped out his more casual look for a suit. And signs on his news conference podiums were changed from ""Axe the Tax"" to ""Canada First."" The party also announced the Canada First rally to be staged on the 60th anniversary of the Canadian flag. Poilievre's office instructed MPs and their families to attend, and automated calls were sent out to ensure a big turnout. Supporters have been encouraged to wear red and white, with the playlist expected to be all-Canadian. While Conservatives still say the top issues for voters are cost of living and crime, they see a rising sense of national pride, which Poilievre wants to capture. Allie Blades, a strategist who worked on Poilievre's 2022 leadership campaign in British Columbia, said the next election will be about the type of leader Canadians want as prime minister. ""We won't necessarily know what our biggest threat will be on the day that we go to the polls. But what I think Canadians will be looking towards is the type of leader that's going to take us through this next big fight."" Although Poilievre is known for his rallies, his speech Saturday is expected to strike a serious tone and tease out additional policy. He's planning to write it himself. But don't expect him to do away with his existing slogans. Instead, he will be adapting them. Instead of a ""common sense plan to axe the tax,"" it will be a ""common sense plan to axe the tax that puts Canadians first."" No longer will be it Poilievre's plan to ""stop the crime."" He will now be saying that his plan to ""stop the crime puts Canadians first."" He is also expected to repeat his previously announced plan to handle the U.S., including by calling for retaliatory tariffs and using the revenue to help workers. The message the Conservatives want Canadians to hear: ""Pierre Poilievre has always put Canada and Canadians first."" Ginny Roth, who served as Poilievre's communications director during his leadership bid, said a rally is a way to energize supporters and volunteers as expectations rise for a spring election. This one is also a chance to show Canadians it is the Conservatives who have been ""the patriots all along."" ""It's been, I think, grating for a lot of Conservatives to hear some of the progressive (Liberal and NDP) leaders who were so dismissive of patriotism, so dismissive of Canadian history ... to be new-found kind of vacant patriots"" in the face of the Trump threats, she said. In the lead up to Saturday, Poilievre has released promises from tearing down interprovincial trade barriers and stiffening the sentences for fentanyl traffickers to boosting border security and building an Arctic military base to be financed by dramatic cuts to foreign aid. Border security, fentanyl smuggling and Canada's lagging defence priorities have been among Trump's complaints. While Conservatives applaud Poilievre's proposals, Philippe Fournier of polling aggregator 338Canada.com questions the wisdom of Poilievre's suggestion to cut aid, given Trump just made deep cuts to U.S. aid. That invites a comparison to Trump, when Canadians want someone to fight him. Critics also question the phrase Canada First, which sounds a lot like Trump's America First policy. Poilievre is a fan of former prime minister Wilfrid Laurier, whom he often cites. The phrase originated from a Laurier quotation: ""Let your motto be: Canada first, Canada last, Canada always."" Conservatives also know they need to be careful not to suggest Trump is right when it comes to blaming Canada's border security for the amount of illegal immigration and fentanyl in the U.S., all the while still promising to tackle these issues. Poilievre is also trying to make the point that the Liberals bear responsibility for the country's vulnerable economic position, which is now threatened by Trump, as a way to steer the message back to the cost of living, Poilievre's positional strong suit. ""We need to keep reminding people this is about affordability,"" said one Conservative MP. ""Axing the tax, axing a whole bunch of taxes, the capital gains tax. I still think taxes, pocketbook issues, affordability are going to feature prominently."" Fournier said it is smart for Conservatives to remain focused on affordability, but said it won't go over well with voters if ""they sound like Trump"" and are seen to be criticizing the Canadian government as it tries to fight the president's threats. Because Conservatives see the carbon tax as a symbol for larger cost-of-living issues, Poilievre isn't expected to stop talking about it, especially when it's proved so effective. Bailing on a key message would also be out of character for a Conservative leader who defines himself by his authenticity. And on axing the carbon tax, Poilievre has another claim to fame.

Conservatives also know they need to be careful not to suggest Trump is right when it comes to blaming Canada's border security for the amount of illegal immigration and fentanyl in the U.S, all the while still promising to tackle these issues.

Poilievre to unveil rebranded message; Tory leader reboots party's patriotic pitch after u.s. president 'has consumed all the oxygen',2025.0,"'Canada First"" is Pierre Poilievre's new pitch to Canadians. But it also represents the firsts that the Conservative leader himself has been navigating in the past few weeks. It's the first time as leader that he has faced off against the Liberals without Prime Minister Justin Trudeau planning to run in the next election. And U.S. President Donald Trump has dealt Poilievre another challenging first: Find a way to talk about affordability, an issue Poilievre has owned, without focusing it all on a ""carbon tax election,"" given that the threat of a trade war with the U.S. seems to be overwhelming Canadians' other economic concerns right now. Something else new for Poilievre is that the Liberals' unpopularity seems to have bottomed out and, with Trudeau leaving, their support is creeping up in the polls after more than a year-and-ahalf of consistently slipping further behind the Conservatives. But even though their world has been shaken, Conservatives are not hitting the panic button. At least not yet. A Conservative MP, who was granted anonymity in order to speak freely, acknowledged what most Conservatives think: that they would definitely have preferred facing off against Trudeau in the upcoming election, given the prime minister's deep unpopularity. Poilievre will be unveiling what he believes to be the message and the tone Canadians want to hear at a Canada First rally on Saturday, staged to coincide with the previously unloved Flag Day, in the same downtown Ottawa convention centre where his leadership of the party began more than two years ago. Leading up to the branding relaunch, National Post spoke with 17 Conservative insiders, veteran strategists, organizers, MPs and grassroots members to understand the challenges Poilievre faces and some of the party's thinking in reorienting his pitch. The main thing they said: it all starts with Trump. Shortly after Trump's victory in November, Poilievre made it clear he wasn't going to be part of Trudeau's so-called Team Canada approach against the president's growing threats of tariffs and taking over Canada. While trying to steer clear of comments that could inflame relations with an unpredictable American leader, Poilievre kept the pressure on Trudeau, accusing him of sending jobs south of the border and criticizing his handling of Trump's first term in office. But then Trudeau announced on Jan. 6 he was resigning and Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20. After that, Conservative thinking changed. ""It's just frustrating, Trump has consumed all oxygen, and Canadians are feeding it by panicking,"" said another Conservative MP, who was also granted anonymity. ""It's all people are talking about."" As Trump's threat to hit all Canadian goods with 25 per cent tariffs hovers like a storm cloud over the country, Poilievre tried in press conferences defending his call for an ""axe the tax election,"" despite everything else that was unfolding. ""Look, I'm not prime minister,"" he said when asked about making inroads with U.S. lawmakers. Inside the party, however, the debate was whether it was the right approach, and whether he needed to start facing the American issue head on. Especially as all the Liberal leadership contenders seemed to be signalling they weren't interested in defending Trudeau's consumer carbon tax. ""Pierre is normally ahead of the curve to identify issues that Canadians care about and leads on them. But I think on the flip side, he never wants to go off message. He very strongly believes in repetition,"" one insider said. The situation presented a challenge for Poilievre, who after more than a year dominating the political agenda in Ottawa, was now facing pressure to shift his message. ""I think Poilievre was too slow, he's catching on now, but he was too slow,"" said Peter Coleman, a longtime Conservative and president of the National Citizens Coalition, a grassroots, right-leaning group. One insider forcefully declared that the carbon-tax election message was ""dead."" Others said the party shouldn't rush its response in the midst of a volatile situation. Some also made the point that hindsight is always 20/20 and that Poilievre was faced with a ""lose-lose"" situation. By early February, the message had sunk in. Poilievre needed to appear more serious about the gravity of the trade threats. He did not criticize Trudeau's announcement on retaliatory tariffs. At the same time, he swapped out his more casual look for a suit. And signs on his press conference podiums were changed from ""Axe the Tax"" to ""Canada First."" The party also announced the Canada First rally to be staged on the 60th anniversary of the Canadian flag. Poilievre's office instructed MPs and their families to attend, and automated calls were sent out to ensure a big turnout. Supporters have been encouraged to wear red and white, with the playlist expected to be all-Canadian. While Conservatives still believe the top issues for voters are cost of living and crime, they see a rising sense of national pride, which Poilievre wants to capture. Allie Blades, a strategist who worked on Poilievre's 2022 leadership campaign in B.C., said the next election will be about the type of leader Canadians want as prime minister. ""We won't necessarily know what our biggest threat will be on the day that we go to the polls. But what I think Canadians will be looking towards is the type of leader that's going to take us through this next big fight."" Although Poilievre is known for his rallies, his speech Saturday is expected to strike a serious tone and tease out additional policy. He's planning to write it himself. But don't expect him to do away with his existing slogans. Instead, he will be adapting them. Instead of a ""common sense plan to axe the tax,"" it will be a ""common sense plan to axe the tax that puts Canadians first."" No longer will be it Poilievre's plan to ""stop the crime."" He will now be saying that his plan to ""stop the crime puts Canadians first."" He is also expected to repeat his previously announced plan to handle the U.S., including by calling for retaliatory tariffs and using the revenues to help workers. The message the Conservatives want Canadians to hear: ""Pierre Poilievre has always put Canada and Canadians first."" Ginny Roth, who served as Poilievre's communications director during his leadership bid, said a rally is a way to energize supporters and volunteers as expectations rise for a spring election. This one is also a chance to show Canadians it is the Conservatives who have been ""the patriots all along."" ""It's been, I think, grating for a lot of Conservatives to hear some of the progressive (Liberal and NDP) leaders who were so dismissive of patriotism, so dismissive of Canadian history ... to be new-found kind of vacant patriots"" in the face of the Trump threats, she said. In the lead-up to Saturday, Poilievre has released promises from tearing down interprovincial trade barriers and stiffening the sentences for fentanyl traffickers to boosting border security and building an Arctic military base to be financed by dramatic cuts to foreign aid. Border security, fentanyl smuggling and Canada's lagging defence priorities have been a complaint of Trump's of course. While Conservatives applaud Poilievre's proposals, Philippe Fournier of polling aggregator 338Canada.com questions the wisdom of Poilievre's suggestion to cut aid, given Trump just made deep cuts to U.S. aid.

"Appeal moves ahead in case of courthouse closures; Former PC government closed Caraquet, Tracadie courthouses",2025.0,"The Holt Liberal government appears to be proceeding with legal action launched by its Progressive Conservative predecessors involving the closure of two courthouses on the Acadian Peninsula. In a Dec. 17 ruling, the Court of Appeal stayed a lower-court decision, paving the way for an appeal to be heard in a long-simmering language rights dispute over the former Higgs government's decision to close the Caraquet courthouse at the end of 2021 and the Tracadie courthouse in June 2022. A group of Acadian mayors ultimately sought a judicial review of the government's decision, arguing the closures infringed on language rights protected by the Charter and provincial laws. In a March 28, 2024, ruling, Court of King's Bench Justice Christa Bourque ordered the province's justice minister to reconsider the closures, finding the government's decision ""had a significant impact on the preservation and the development of the minority language community."" That court order is now stayed pending the outcome of the appeal launched by Ted Flemming, then attorney general and justice minister, back in April 2024. Brunswick News asked Thursday for an interview with new Attorney General and Justice Minister Rob McKee to understand the Liberal government's position on the closure of the courthouses and the appeal. McKee was sworn into cabinet days after his PC predecessor sought a stay of the court order that required the government to rethink its position on the courthouse closures. McKee was not made available for an interview Thursday, but his department confirmed the Court of King's Bench decision had been stayed ""pending the appeal, which will be heard in May."" Flemming cited a ""significant decrease"" in the volume of provincial court cases on the Acadian Peninsula when he announced the decision back in November 2021 to start sending those cases to the Bathurst courthouse. By that point in time, both the Caraquet and Tracadie courthouses had already been running on a part-time basis since the summer of 2020. After the March 2024 ruling, Flemming pledged there would be a review of the closures to confirm that they hadn't resulted in ""any unexpected negative effects,"" but an appeal was still needed as sections of Bourque's decision ""could have greater repercussions on the government's decisions in the future if they are not challenged."" Last October, a three-member panel suspended the hearing of the appeal after it was discovered Flemming hadn't complied with the court order or sought a stay of it pending the outcome of the hearing. Two days after that suspension, the outgoing minister filed a motion requesting a stay of the court order under appeal. That was granted on Dec. 17 by Justice Denise LeBlanc, who found the request met the three-stage test for a stay of proceedings. ""In this case, the parties agree that there is a serious constitutional issue to be determined on the merits of the case,"" LeBlanc wrote in her decision. ""As for the second and third stages of the test, in the absence of a stay of proceedings compelling the Minister to comply with the order, the latter would suffer irreparable harm in that the appeal would become moot and deprive him of a remedy."" Brunswick News requested comment from Caraquet Mayor Bernard Thériault, who filed an affidavit in support of the judicial review, and from La Société de l'Acadie du Nouveau-Brunswick, which is an intervenor in the case. The newspaper did not hear back from either as of press time. All civil, family and criminal law matters are now heard at the Bathurst courthouse following the closure of the Caraquet and Tracadie courthouses. Both official languages are used at the Bathurst courthouse, but the location is about an hour's drive from Caraquet and an hour's drive from Tracadie.","Telegraph-Journal; Saint John, N.B.","Saint John, N.B.","Simpson, Barbara",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 15, 2025",Attorneys general; Court decisions; Judicial reviews; Courthouses,,2025-02-15,Telegraph-Journal
Provincial leaders face off in northern debate:   PC Leader Doug Ford was targeted for his housing record and calling an early election,,"Ontario’s four main political party leaders squared off on Friday in North Bay for the first of two debates, with the opposition targeting Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford for calling a snap election more than a year ahead of schedule. During the event, hosted by the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, Mr. Ford defended his early election call, saying he needed another four-year term to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie and Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner went after Mr. Ford for his record on affordability, housing and health care, as well as ethics. The leaders frequently clashed on stage and spoke over one another, as the moderator, CBC Radio host Markus Schwabe, tried to steer the conversation back to prearranged topics that had a focus on Northern Ontario issues, such as forestry, mining, and highway maintenance. The PC Leader focused his remarks on the economy and Mr. Trump, but also attacked his rivals for opposing his government’s measures and accused them of supporting higher taxes. He aimed most of his barbs at Ms. Crombie, the former mayor of Mississauga, whom recent polls have shown in a distant second place. The second, and final, debate before the election takes place Monday night. Ontarians go to the polls Feb. 27. Here are some key take-aways from the leaders’ first clash: 1) DONALD TRUMP, AND AN EARLY VOTE The U.S. President cast a shadow over the debate, with Mr. Ford referencing Mr. Trump’s tariffs in his opening remarks as the biggest threat to the province’s economy. The other leaders criticized the PC Leader for calling the campaign in the middle of a crisis – and heading to Washington this week. “You fly off in the middle of an election for photo-ops in Washington with low-level advisers,” Ms. Crombie said. “What’s the point?” 2) HOUSING While Ontario has seen its number of housing starts sink, Mr. Ford – who has slashed rules meant to preserve farmland and was mired in a scandal over opening up the protected Greenbelt to development – defended his record. He said he was cutting red tape and that no government had done more for housing. “They don’t want to build,” Mr. Ford said of his opponents. “They want to tax people to death, that’s what they believe in.” He took aim at Ms. Crombie, saying Mississauga shrunk in population on her watch and that she had raised taxes. (The Liberal platform calls for exempting firsttime home buyers, seniors and non-profits from land-transfer taxes and cutting the development fees municipalities charge builders.) Ms. Stiles said the PC government had allowed rents to shoot “through the roof” across the province, especially in the north and said an NDP government would get back in the business of building affordable housing. “Where are the houses? Where are the homes that Doug Ford said he was going to build? Where are the homes, Doug?” the NDP Leader asked. “He has not done a dang thing about it.” 3) ADDICTION AND HOMELESSNESS The debate’s tone changed as the leaders discussed the opioid overdose crisis and homelessness. Ms. Crombie shared the story of her biological father, who suffered from mental health and addiction issues and left her family when she was young. Mr. Ford also alluded to his family’s struggles. His brother Rob’s tumultuous term as Toronto’s mayor was plagued by his drug and alcohol use. The other leaders accused the PC government of doing too little to help with homelessness and drug addiction. “On this issue, I have got to tell you, my priority is taking care of people,” Ms. Stiles said. “Some of the people on this stage are going to just want to throw people into jail.” Mr. Ford, who has pledged to strengthen police powers to clear encampments, also defended his move to shut down supervised injection sites near schools or daycares and instead fund centres he says will funnel people into treatment. “I know no one wants a drugaddiction site beside a school or a daycare. But my three folks here, on the stage, they voted against that,” Mr. Ford said, as Ms. Crombie muttered “no, we didn’t.” The Liberals in fact supported the PC bill when it passed in December. 4) AFFORDABILITY The opposition leaders took aim at Mr. Ford for the affordability crisis in Ontario, saying housing prices are among the highest in the world and that families are struggling. Mr. Ford turned the conversation back to the economy, saying he’s never raised taxes. He attacked Ms. Crombie, calling her the “queen of the carbon tax,” despite her previous comments saying she doesn’t support consumer carbon pricing. 5) MEMORABLE LINES “Mr. Schreiner, he won’t cut down a dandelion to put the shovels in the ground. He just won’t do it.” – Mr. Ford on his view that his opponents, including the Green Party Leader, don’t believe in building homes or infrastructure. “You talk a good tale and you sound kind of folksy and charming, but none of what you’re saying is actually true.” – Ms. Crombie on Mr. Ford’s pledges to end hallway health care, cut income taxes or build 1.5 million homes. “It’s outrageous, these two fighting over who built the least housing in Ontario.” – Ms. Stiles on Mr. Ford and Ms. Crombie squabbling over their records. “I’m going to invite you canoeing and kayaking so you too can explore the beautiful north, Premier. It’s beautiful up here.” – Ms. Crombie, during a segment on the north’s forestry industry. “Nobody in Ontario, when housing should be a human right, should be homeless tonight.” – Mr. Schreiner.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Gray, Jeff; Stone, Laura",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 15, 2025",Taxes; Drug overdose; Political campaigns; Addictions; Political leadership; Homeless people; Housing starts; Housing prices,,2025-02-15,The Globe and Mail
"AIMCo shutters offices in New York and Singapore; Finance First Major move since shakeup fired CEO, put former pm harper in as Board Chair",2025.0,"Alberta In vestment Management Corp. has shuttered its international offices in New York and Singapore in its first major move since the Alberta government shook up the board and management at the province's major investment manager and appointed former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper as chair. ""AIMCo has made the decision to close its offices in New York and Singapore as part of a strategic realignment of resources to better serve our clients,"" spokesperson Carolyn Quick said. ""The decision follows a careful evaluation of the operational costs and the overall impact on our investment objectives. We are confident in our ability to maintain a strong global presence and will continue to fulfil our purpose through our other offices."" In addition to the office closures, AIMCo has parted ways with two senior investment managers. Quick confirmed that David Scudellari, a senior executive hired with much fanfare in 2023 to ramp up private credit investments, has also parted ways with AIMCo. He was recruited from the Public Sector Pension Investment Board and his portfolio was expanded in September to include overseeing global private assets, such as private credit, infrastructure, real estate and private equity, following the departure of chief investment officer Marlene Puffer. AIMCo's newest international offices in New York and Singapore were opened over the past couple of years under former chief executive Evan Siddall, who was fired in November as part of a stunning shakeup that also removed the entire AIMCo board. Three of the directors were then brought back and Harper was named chair. Ray Gilmour, a top Alberta government bureaucrat, was installed as interim CEO. Alberta Finance Minister Nate Horner said the shakeup was undertaken because AIMCo's costs had dramatically risen and returns had not kept up, a narrative that was disputed point by point in a letter sent to him by former chair Kenneth Kroner. Sources said that friction had been building between AIMCo and the government for months, with one of the tension points being the government's unhappiness with the investment manager's international expansion, which included expensive real estate and was viewed as drawing well-paid investment jobs away from Alberta. The New York office was opened in 2024, and Siddall at the time said having a physical presence in important financial markets would greatly enhance how investments were sourced, evaluated and ultimately executed. He said the international offices were necessary to further diversify the asset mix for AIMCo clients, which include the Alberta government. Siddall said the investment manager had ""a significant client mandate"" to expand AIMCo's private credit portfolio and that having a team based in Manhattan would help accelerate those efforts. The Singapore office was opened in 2023. Kevin Bong, a veteran investment executive brought in to run the office, is no longer with AIMCo, Quick said. With the closures, AIMCo, which invests on behalf of a variety of pension, endowment and government funds in Alberta, now has five offices: Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto, London and Luxembourg.

"'Any level of damage': Harper would dig in against Trump; Independence worth heavy toll, former PM says",2025.0,"Stephen Harper told a crowd in Ottawa Tuesday that if he were still prime minister, he would accept ""any level of damage"" to Canada, rather than see it join the United States as the 51st state. ""I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" Harper said. The former prime minister was speaking before an invitation-only crowd to promote his new book, Flags of Canada, about the history of the Canadian flag. But, given the drama of Donald Trump's tariff threats against Canada and his now-repeated musings about Canada becoming the 51st state, Harper couldn't avoid touching on current affairs, according to a report in the Toronto Star. ""Now, because I do think that if Trump were determined, he could really do wide structural and economic damage, but I wouldn't accept that,"" said Harper, according to the Star. ""I would accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country."" In recent weeks, Trump's rhetoric around Canada and Mexico has escalated. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was recently caught on a hot mic saying that he believes Trump's comments about annexing Canada are ""a real thing"" In contrast, his defence minister, Bill Blair, said Wednesday that he thinks it is not a ""real threat."" The minister was in Brussels to meet with NATO allies and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. Blair and Trudeau had a breakfast meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte Wednesday morning. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Blair said that while Trump's comments are ""disrespectful and concerning,"" he doesn't see them as a serious threat. At the moment, Canada and the United States are in a bit of a holding pattern over tariffs. A 30-day pause agreed to last week was upended earlier this week when Trump announced 25-percent tariffs on steel and aluminum effective March 12. The across-the-board U.S. tariffs could come into effect on March 4, if Canada's plan to step up border security doesn't pacify the president. Harper, who now runs a consultancy, said that while he was willing to impoverish Canada to maintain its independence, it would also be critical to have a plan to rebuild the country's economy. ""Important in that is to have a plan of how we would reorient our economy, so we would recover that prosperity again, and not just solve the damage,"" Harper said. Harper recently joined the four other living former prime ministers - Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin - to im - plore Canadians to fly the Canadian flag this Saturday, the 60th anniversary of its adoption. ""In the face of threats and insults from Donald Trump, Canadians have come together to express their love for our country and their determination to defend Canada's values and our independence,"" the five former leaders wrote. ""As former prime ministers of Canada, we applaud this national spirit."" In fact, in Ottawa Tuesday, Harper did commend Trudeau for his patriotic fervour in the face of the Trump threats, the Star reported.

It will be Carney vs. Poilievre; And neither has clear advantage Comment,2025.0,"The Liberal leadership race is effectively over and the 2025 Canadian general election just got a lot more interesting. As with swallows and summers, one poll does not define any political contest. But any Liberals who decide to vote for anyone other than Mark Carney after Leger's latest survey might as well form a circular firing squad. The poll suggested that the Conservative lead across the countr y has been whittled down to nine points from 18 points during the firm's last survey. Leger has Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives at 40 per cent support, compared to 31 per cent for the Liberals. However, Liberal support rises to 37 per cent when respondents were asked to consider Carney as leader, while the number of Conservative voters slips into a statistical dead heat. (Given the inefficiency of a Conservative vote heavily concentrated in the West, that would likely see the Liberals re-elected.) The bad news for Chrystia Freeland's leadership campaign is that with her as leader, Liberal support declines to 28 per cent and the Conservatives maintain a strong lead at 38 per cent. Liberal party members would have to be pretty dumb to ignore such obvious signals from the electorate, and when it comes to holding onto power, Liberals are not dumb. As mentioned, this is just one poll, but the trendlines are supported by others. It is an exceptional turnaround in public sentiment, but we are living in a singular moment. When Justin Trudeau resigned just last month, most polling firms had the Conser vatives ahead by more than 20 percentage points. Yet, Poilievre's lead has always been predicated on deep enmity toward Trudeau, rather than an affection for the Conservative leader. Abacus Data polls consistently revealed that around one-third of those who said they supported Poilievre were parking their vote and could be persuaded to change their minds if a better alternative came along. For many of those people, Carney seems like the right person at the right time. The Leger poll suggests that eight out of 10 Canadians are concerned U.S. President Donald Trump will use tariffs to pressure Canada into a closer union with the U.S. Poilievre's ""axe the tax"" mantra resonates less loudly against the backdrop of potential annexation. The Conservative leader and Carney are in a statistical tie when it comes to being trusted to deal with Trump. But Carney has a clear advantage when it comes to experience in major crises. (I disclose, as I have before, that I have been friends with Carney for more than a decade.) The Conservatives have millions of dollars to paint the presumptive Liberal leader as ""Carbon Tax Carney"" or to denigrate his role as governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. But the facts remain: Carney was in the Cash Room at the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 with the other G7 finance ministers and central bankers when the decision was taken to backstop the banking system with liquidity to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression. He was chair of the Financial Stability Board, the international body that cleaned up the mess in the wake of the financial crisis. And he was the governor of the Bank of England who warned that Brexit would weaken the pound, undermine investment, lead to higher unemployment and cripple economic growth. (A 2021 report by the U.K. Office of Budget Responsibility calculated that Brexit will cost Britain four per cent of GDP per annum going forward or $57 billion a year). Against that, Poilievre's resume is, let's say, one-dimensional. The Conservative leader also sounds almost Trumpian in his rhetoric, in a way that could harm his cause with potential switch voters. That's not to suggest that he subscribes to Trump's delusional mercantilism or casual corruption. But in his Arctic security announcement this week, he talked of ""dramatically cutting foreign aid."" At a time when Trump is discarding allies, surely it would pay to do the opposite: to assert the value of soft power in the battle to win friends and influence people. Poilievre's sympathies are often too narrow for many voters who are not fully invested in his project. How many people were cheering him on this week, when he tweeted out that Carney was wearing $2,000 Zegna sneakers during a photo op? If there was ever a time to put away childish things, it is now. At the same time, Carney has baggage - not least the Liberal brand. Poilievre had a point when he said that the team of Trudeau ministers who are now backing Carney not only endorsed his agenda, they helped write it, push it and implement it. ""Keeping Trudeau's team is the same as keeping Trudeau."" The mere sight of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault endorsing Carney was probably enough for many Poilievre waverers to stiffen their spines. The sense that the Liberals need to be consigned to the penalty box remains strong and may be a decisive factor in the coming election. Then there is Carney himself. His defining mission in recent years has been climate action and it was telling that his first policy commitment was a plan that would dump the consumer carbon tax he says is now too divisive and replace it with a new approach that relies on financial incentives for appliances, cars and insulation. He would tighten existing output-based carbon regimes that regulate heavy emitters to avoid credit oversupply, though since those programs are run by the provinces it is not clear how he would do that. He would make investments in electrified transportation and develop a carbon-based adjustment mechanism - loosely, tariffs on countries that don't take climate action, to avoid ""carbon leakage."" It is a fairly modest plan. But the fact that it was his first priority is the problem. He has been vague, for example, about whether he is in favour of building pipelines east and west to diversify the customer base for our energy. Frankly, people have more immediate concerns, such as the president of the United States saying he wants to annex their country and plans to squeeze them economically until they submit to his will. If Trump follows through, as it appears he has every intention of doing, Canada's emissions growth will cease to be a problem because there will be no growth of any kind. The Leger poll suggests nearly nine in 10 Canadians are worried, if not stressed about it. The only source of consolation is that a roughly equal number say they feel pride in being Canadian, a significant increase on the number who said the same the last time the question was asked nearly a year ago. Carney has talked about us being masters in our own house; Poilievre has promised he will build a self-reliant, sovereign nation. The only way out of this mess is to choose a national leader who is resolute in defence of Canada, who is prepared to safeguard its economy and who is willing to use its natural resources to benefit all Canadians. The next election will be a contest to decide who is best positioned to do that job. jivison@criffel.ca","Star - Phoenix; Saskatoon, Sask.","Saskatoon, Sask.","Ivison, John",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 14, 2025",Conservatism; Polls & surveys; Carbon; Mercantilism; Environmental tax; Tariffs; Political campaigns; Leadership; Voters; Climate action,Nom: Bank of England; NAICS: 521110,2025-02-14,Star - Phoenix
"Ford called for return to capital punishment:   'Send 'em right to sparky,' PC leader said in campaign speech at London police gala",2025.0,"Doug Ford took his tough-on-crime talk to new heights in a campaign speech where he pushed for a return to capital punishment, the Star has learned. Musing about stiffer penalties for home invaders who kill victims, the Ontario Progressive Conservative leader called for changes in the federal Criminal Code that would empower judges to ""send 'em right to sparky."" The colloquial reference to the electric chair came two weeks ago, on the first day of Ford's snap Feb. 27 Ontario election campaign, now at its midway point. A recording of the speech to the London Police Service's sold-out inaugural ""chief's gala appreciation dinner and awards night"" - which was not listed on Ford's daily campaign itinerary provided to reporters at Queen's Park - was obtained by the Star. Canada abolished capital punishment in 1976, replacing it with mandatory life sentences with no parole for at least 25 years in cases of first-degree murder. ""God forbid they kill an innocent person,"" Ford said on Jan. 29 to an audience of about 1,000 law enforcement personnel, legal types, politicians and business people at the downtown RBC Place London. He was referring to his frustration with the alarming trend of violent home invasion robberies. ""I don't even go 25 years. I send 'em right to sparky and then we'll take everything from there,"" he added to sparse clapping and audible gasps in an audience that had moments earlier given him hearty applause for promising a $1-billion rebuild of the aging Ontario Police College in nearby Aylmer. ""We need to straighten out all these criminals ... Sorry for sidetracking. I just had to vent a little bit,"" Ford continued. A lawyer who attended the event said the crowd was taken aback by the ""sparky"" line. ""The whole room seemed uncomfortable,"" added the lawyer, who is known to the Star but requested anonymity to speak freely. ""I felt like I was in a bit of an alternate reality. I felt like I was in the States. It felt very Trumpian."" Earlier in the speech, Ford acknowledged his penchant for off-the-cuff remarks could get him in trouble. ""You know, I was warned by my campaign, 'Do not go off script ... do not say anything controversial. You're on a campaign.' Well, that's just not who I am,"" he said before advocating for stricter sentences and bail conditions. Ford's campaign did not initially address the ""sparky"" capital punishment remark directly when asked by the Star if a return to the death penalty is official Progressive Conservative policy, saying only that his ""No. 1 concern"" is keeping communities and police safe. But campaign officials put out a fresh statement six hours later in an attempt to control the damage, after the revelations first appeared on thestar.com. ""The premier made a poor-taste joke out of frustration for the many people affected by violent criminals on our streets because of the federal government's broken bail system,"" his campaign said in an email. ""The premier does not support capital punishment but rather firmly believes more needs to be done to keep violent and repeat offenders behind bars where they belong."" In his speech, Ford also expressed a desire to wade into national issues with a nod to a possible spring federal election. ""Hopefully, when a new government comes in, I think the provinces should take over some of the Criminal Code,"" he told the London crowd, taking shots at judges and justices of the peace who grant bail to repeat offenders in a call for tougher bail reform. ""I want pro-police, hard-on-crime JPs,"" Ford said. ""We do have some good JPs. We have some really good judges, too. But from previous administrations and governments, we have some terrible JPs, terrible judges that actually let these criminals back out."" Ford did not explain in the speech how provinces could gain any control over the Criminal Code. In their initial response to the Star, campaign officials said, ""We will continue to push for reforms such as restoring mandatory minimum sentencing for serious crimes, removing bail availability for serious offences, and implementing a three-strikes rule that mandates pretrial detention for repeat offenders. ""Every day, we see convicted criminals out on bail who turn around and commit horrific crimes."" In Washington, D.C., earlier this week, Ford said in a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce that the Canadian government should pass ""strict"" mandatory minimum sentences for those caught with fentanyl, a powerful and potentially deadly drug that is under the Trump administration's microscope. ""Any thug convicted of trafficking fentanyl or other illegal drugs gets thrown in jail for good. That's it. They're done. They're gone."" The ""sparky"" comment came five days before a hot mic gaffe at Ford's Etobicoke North campaign office, where he told a handful of supporters that he wanted Donald Trump to win the U.S. presidential election in November. ""On election day, was I happy the guy won? One hundred per cent I was. Then the guy pulled out the knife and f--ing yanked it in me,"" he said, making a stabbing motion with his hand. That remark was widely ridiculed by rival party leaders who said that support for Trump shows Ford's hypocrisy. Ford has staked his campaign for a third term as premier on fighting Trump's levies, and spent Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington lobbying U.S. politicians. He will return next week. It's expected Ford's controversial comments will be fodder for opposition party leaders at Friday's northern Ontario debate in North Bay and the main leaders debate Monday night in Toronto. An Abacus Data poll for the Star last week found that the hot mic gaffe about supporting Trump revealed risks to the Progressive Conservative campaign. While 43 per cent in the online survey of 2,000 voters found Ford's remark had ""no impact"" on their voting intentions, 35 per cent said it would make them ""less likely"" to cast a ballot for the Progressive Conservative candidate in their riding and 22 per cent indicated they would be ""more likely"" to vote PC. ""It definitely reminded people who aren't Ford fans today why they probably aren't Ford fans,"" Abacus president David Coletto told the Star. Nevertheless, Ford maintains a comfortable lead over Bonnie Crombie's Liberals and the New Democrats under Marit Stiles in public opinion polls. Ford called the election 15 months early, portraying himself as the best leader to stand up to Trump's threat of 25 per cent tariffs on most imports from Canada, a move that would devastate a provincial economy that is heavily reliant on trade. Opposition parties have accused Ford of calling an early and expensive election - at a cost of $189 million - to get ahead of any possible charges in the RCMP criminal investigation of the government's $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap scandal. They say his focus on Trump and tariffs is an attempt to distract voters from problems on the home front, such as a physician shortage that has left 2.5 million Ontarians without a family doctor, worsening ""hallway health care"" in overcrowded hospitals, a housing shortage that has sent prices skyrocketing, growing homeless encampments and affordability challenges following a period of high inflation in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Ford accused of breaking ethics rule:   New Democrats claim PC leader 'blurred lines' between campaigning, governing with online ad",2025.0,"Doug Ford violated ethics rules against using government activities for partisan purposes in an online ad about his trip to Washington to lobby against Trump tariffs, opposition parties charge. The ad on the Progressive Conservative leader's X feed Thursday pictured him walking past the U.S. Capitol. It used the party's ""Protect Ontario"" logo and slogan from his bid for a third term as premier in a snap election he called for Feb. 27. The ad was quickly taken off social media and reposted a few hours later with no Conservative logo or slogans. ""If that isn't a sure sign of guilt, I don't know what is,"" NDP Leader Marit Stiles said in Sudbury, insisting the ad retains partisan overtones because it was posted in the context of the campaign. ""I don't think anyone's fooled,"" Stiles added, noting her party filed a complaint with Ontario's integrity commissioner J. David Wake that Ford has ""blurred the lines"" between campaigning and governing. In a letter to Wake, Stiles requested an investigation into whether ""taxpayer dollars were put to use in service of personal or partisan gain of Doug Ford."" Ford's campaign defended the ad. ""Footage of the premier being the premier is routinely used in political social content,"" spokesperson Ivana Yelich said in a statement to the Star. ""However, out of an abundance of caution, the video was reposted without campaign branding."" Wake ruled before the Washington trip that fighting tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump is ""an urgent manner in the public interest"" but cautioned that Ford and his cabinet members can take part in related events ""provided that the activities are not then used for partisan purposes."" His office declined further comment Thursday. The Conservative party slogan in the ad, in which Ford intones, ""Let's focus on restoring the pride of made in the U.S.A and made in Canada,"" quickly raised concerns once it hit social media. Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said the Conservative campaign knew of the caution issued by the integrity commissioner and chose to ignore it. ""Doug Ford plays fast and loose with the rules,"" she told reporters in Elmvale, near Barrie. Ford appeared in the ad with PC candidates Vic Fedeli and Stephen Lecce, walking with the U.S. Capitol towering above them. Ford is pictured speaking to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and meeting with U.S. officials and in news conferences and scrums with reporters. As head of the Council of the Federation, he led a delegation of premiers to Washington to argue against tariffs on Canada. The Progressive Conservatives said they paid the travel expenses of Ford and his campaign staff. Crombie had previously raised concerns the trip violated the so-called ""caretaker convention,"" which holds that the only government business that can be carried out during an election campaign is routine or urgent matters in the public interest. CAPTION: PC Leader Doug Ford is shown this week in Washington. An ad on his X feed Thursday showed him walking past the U.S. Capitol and used the party's ""Protect Ontario"" logo and slogan from his campaign bid.

"'Any level of damage': Harper would dig in against Trump; Independence worth heavy toll, former PM says",2025.0,"Stephen Harper told a crowd in Ottawa Tuesday that if he were still prime minister, he would accept ""any level of damage"" to Canada, rather than see it join the United States as the 51st state. ""I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" Harper said. The former prime minister was speaking before an invitation-only crowd to promote his new book, Flags of Canada, about the history of the Canadian flag. But, given the drama of Donald Trump's tariff threats against Canada and his now-repeated musings about Canada becoming the 51st state, Harper couldn't avoid touching on current affairs, according to a report in the Toronto Star. ""Now, because I do think that if Trump were deter-mined, he could really do wide structural and economic damage, but I wouldn't accept that,"" said Harper, according to the Star. ""I would accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country."" In recent weeks, Trump's rhetoric around Canada and Mexico has escalated. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was recently caught on a hot mic saying that he believes Trump's comments about annexing Canada - which he initially suggested was a joke over dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago - are ""a real thing"" In contrast, his defence minister, Bill Blair, said Wednesday that he thinks it is not a ""real threat."" The minister was in Brussels to meet with NATO allies and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. Blair and Trudeau had a breakfast meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte Wednesday morning. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Blair said that while Trump's comments are ""disrespectful and concerning,"" he doesn't see them as a serious threat. ""Certainly we're concerned about those remarks, and I think overwhelmingly for all Canadians those remarks are offensive. We're proud of our country,"" he said. ""We've assured all of our allies we're prepared to stand up for our country. I do not believe that represents a real threat to us."" At the moment, Canada and the United States are in a bit of a holding pattern over tariffs. A 30-day pause agreed to last week was upended earlier this week when Trump announced 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum effective March 12. The across-theboard U.S. tariffs could come into effect on March 4, if Canada's plan to step up border security doesn't pacify the president. Harper, who now runs a consultancy, said that while he was willing to impoverish Canada to maintain its independence, it would also be critical to have a plan to rebuild the country's economy. The vast majority of Canadian trade goes to our southern neighbour. ""Important in that is to have a plan of how we would reorient our economy, so we would recover that prosperity again, and not just solve the damage,"" Harper said. Since his defeat in 2015, Harper has rarely commented on Canadian public affairs. When he has spoken to the media - fewer than a half-dozen times in the past near-decade - it has often been to U.S. news podcasts, including in January when he shellacked Trudeau to a Florida podcaster and expressed shock at the way Trump has treated its closest ally. Harper also recently joined the four other living former prime ministers - Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin - to implore Canadians to fly the Canadian flag this Saturday, the 60th anniversary of its adoption. ""In the face of threats and insults from Donald Trump, Canadians have come together to express their love for our country and their determination to defend Canada's values and our independence,"" the five former leaders wrote. ""As former prime ministers of Canada, we applaud this national spirit. And we call on our fellow Canadians to show the flag as never before."" In fact, in Ottawa Tuesday, Harper did commend Trudeau for his patriotic fervour in the face of the Trump threats, the Star reported. Harper was speaking at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society office in Ottawa to promote his new book, which will be published Feb. 25. Harper spoke about how Canada had evolved from using the Union Jack and the Red Ensign before engaging in an intense debate under Lester B. Pearson to adopt the current Canadian flag.

"'Any level of damage': Harper would dig in against Trump; Independence worth heavy toll, former PM says",2025.0,"Stephen Harper told a crowd in Ottawa Tuesday that if he were still prime minister, he would accept ""any level of damage"" to Canada, rather than see it join the United States as the 51st state. ""I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" Harper said. The former prime minister was speaking before an invitation-only crowd to promote his new book, Flags of Canada, about the history of the Canadian flag. But, given the drama of Donald Trump's tariff threats against Canada and his now-repeated musings about Canada becoming the 51st state, Harper couldn't avoid touching on current affairs, according to a report in the Toronto Star. ""Now, because I do think that if Trump were deter-mined, he could really do wide structural and economic damage, but I wouldn't accept that,"" said Harper, according to the Star. ""I would accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country."" In recent weeks, Trump's rhetoric around Canada and Mexico has escalated. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was recently caught on a hot mic saying that he believes Trump's comments about annexing Canada - which he initially suggested was a joke over dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago - are ""a real thing"" In contrast, his defence minister, Bill Blair, said Wednesday that he thinks it is not a ""real threat."" The minister was in Brussels to meet with NATO allies and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. Blair and Trudeau had a breakfast meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte Wednesday morning. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Blair said that while Trump's comments are ""disrespectful and concerning,"" he doesn't see them as a serious threat. ""Certainly we're concerned about those remarks, and I think overwhelmingly for all Canadians those remarks are offensive. We're proud of our country,"" he said. ""We've assured all of our allies we're prepared to stand up for our country. I do not believe that represents a real threat to us."" At the moment, Canada and the United States are in a bit of a holding pattern over tariffs. A 30-day pause agreed to last week was upended earlier this week when Trump announced 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum effective March 12. The across-theboard U.S. tariffs could come into effect on March 4, if Canada's plan to step up border security doesn't pacify the president. Harper, who now runs a consultancy, said that while he was willing to impoverish Canada to maintain its independence, it would also be critical to have a plan to rebuild the country's economy. The vast majority of Canadian trade goes to our southern neighbour. ""Important in that is to have a plan of how we would reorient our economy, so we would recover that prosperity again, and not just solve the damage,"" Harper said. Since his defeat in 2015, Harper has rarely commented on Canadian public affairs. When he has spoken to the media - fewer than a half-dozen times in the past near-decade - it has often been to U.S. news podcasts, including in January when he shellacked Trudeau to a Florida podcaster and expressed shock at the way Trump has treated its closest ally. Harper also recently joined the four other living former prime ministers - Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin - to implore Canadians to fly the Canadian flag this Saturday, the 60th anniversary of its adoption. ""In the face of threats and insults from Donald Trump, Canadians have come together to express their love for our country and their determination to defend Canada's values and our independence,"" the five former leaders wrote. ""As former prime ministers of Canada, we applaud this national spirit. And we call on our fellow Canadians to show the flag as never before."" In fact, in Ottawa Tuesday, Harper did commend Trudeau for his patriotic fervour in the face of the Trump threats, the Star reported. Harper was speaking at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society office in Ottawa to promote his new book, which will be published Feb. 25. Harper spoke about how Canada had evolved from using the Union Jack and the Red Ensign before engaging in an intense debate under Lester B. Pearson to adopt the current Canadian flag.

It will be Carney vs. Poilievre. And neither has clear advantage,2025.0,"The Liberal leadership race is effectively over and the 2025 Canadian general election just got a lot more interesting. As with swallows and summers, one poll does not define any political contest. But any Liberals who decide to vote for anyone other than Mark Carney after Leger's latest survey might as well form a circular firing squad. The poll suggested that the Conservative lead across the country has been whittled down to nine points from 18 points during the firm's last survey. Leger has Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives at 40 per cent support, compared to 31 per cent for the Liberals. However, Liberal support rises to 37 per cent when respondents were asked to consider Carney as leader, while the number of Conservative voters slips into a statistical dead heat. (Given the inefficiency of a Conservative vote heavily concentrated in the West, that would likely see the Liberals re-elected.) The bad news for Chrystia Freeland's leadership campaign is that with her as leader, Liberal support declines to 28 per cent and the Conservatives maintain a strong lead at 38 per cent. Liberal party members would have to be pretty dumb to ignore such obvious signals from the electorate, and when it comes to holding onto power, Liberals are not dumb. As mentioned, this is just one poll but the trendlines are supported by others. It is an exceptional turnaround in public sentiment, but we are living in a singular moment. When Justin Trudeau resigned just last month, most polling firms had the Conservatives ahead by more than 20 percentage points. Yet Poilievre's lead has always been predicated on deep enmity toward Trudeau, rather than an affection for the Conservative leader. Abacus Data polls consistently revealed that around one-third of those who said they supported Poilievre were parking their vote and could be persuaded to change their minds if a better alternative came along. For many of those people, Carney seems like the right person at the right time. The Leger poll suggests that eight out of 10 Canadians are concerned U.S. President Donald Trump will use tariffs to pressure Canada into a closer union with the U.S. Poilievre's ""axe the tax"" mantra resonates less loudly against the backdrop of potential annexation. The Conservative leader and Carney are in a statistical tie when it comes to being trusted to deal with Trump. But Carney has a clear advantage when it comes to experience in major crises. (I disclose, as I have before, that I have been friends with Carney for more than a decade.) The Conservatives have millions of dollars to paint the presumptive Liberal leader as ""Carbon Tax Carney"" or to denigrate his role as governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. But the facts remain: Carney was in the Cash Room at the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 with the other G7 finance ministers and central bankers when the decision was taken to backstop the banking system with liquidity to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression. He was chair of the Financial Stability Board, the international body that cleaned up the mess in the wake of the financial crisis. And he was the governor of the Bank of England who warned that Brexit would weaken the pound, undermine investment, lead to higher unemployment and cripple economic growth. (A 2021 report by the U.K. Office of Budget Responsibility calculated that Brexit will cost Britain four per cent of GDP per annum going forward or $57 billion a year). Against that, Poilievre's re - sume is, let's say, one-dimensional. The Conservative leader also sounds almost Trumpian in his rhetoric, in a way that could harm his cause with potential switch voters. That's not to suggest that he subscribes to Trump's delusional mercantilism or casual corruption. But in his Arctic security announcement this week, he talked of ""dramatically cutting foreign aid."" At a time when Trump is discarding allies, surely it would pay to do the opposite: to assert the value of soft power in the battle to win friends and influence people. Poilievre's sympathies are often too narrow for many voters who are not fully invested in his project. How many people were cheering him on this week, when he tweeted out that Carney was wearing $2,000 Zegna sneakers during a photo op? If there was ever a time to put away childish things, it is now. At the same time, Carney has baggage - not least the Liberal brand. Poilievre had a point when he said that the team of Trudeau ministers who are now backing Carney not only endorsed his agenda, they helped write it, push it and implement it. ""Keeping Trudeau's team is the same as keeping Trudeau."" The mere sight of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault endorsing Carney was probably enough for many Poilievre waverers to stiffen their spines. The sense that the Liberals need to be consigned to the penalty box remains strong and may be a decisive factor in the coming election. Then there is Carney himself. His defining mission in recent years has been climate action and it was telling that his first policy commitment was a plan that would dump the consumer carbon tax he says is now too divisive and replace it with a new approach that relies on financial incentives for appliances, cars and insulation. He would tighten existing output-based carbon regimes that regulate heavy emitters to avoid credit oversupply, though since those programs are run by the provinces it is not clear how he would do that. He would make investments in electrified transportation and develop a carbon-based adjustment mechanism - loosely, tariffs on countries that don't take climate action, to avoid ""carbon leakage."" It is a fairly modest plan. But the fact that it was his first priority is the problem. He has been vague, for example, about whether he is in favour of building pipelines east and west to divers- ify the customer base for our energy. Frankly, people have more immediate concerns, such as the president of the United States saying he wants to annex their country and plans to squeeze them economically until they submit to his will. If Trump follows through, as it appears he has every intention of doing, Canada's emissions growth will cease to be a problem because there will be no growth of any kind. The Leger poll suggests nearly nine in 10 Canadians are worried, if not stressed about it. The only source of consolation is that a roughly equal number say they feel pride in being Canadian, a significant increase on the number who said the same the last time the question was asked nearly a year ago. Carney has talked about us being masters in our own house; Poilievre has promised he will build a self-reliant, sovereign nation. The only way out of this mess is to choose a national leader who is resolute in defence of Canada, who is prepared to safeguard its economy and who is willing to use its natural resources to benefit all Canadians. The next election will be a contest to decide who is best positioned to do that job.

He would tighten existing output-based carbon regimes that regulate heavy emitters to avoid credit oversupply, though since those programs are run by the provinces it is not clear how he would do that. He would make investments in electrified transportation and develop a carbon-based adjustment mechanism - loosely, tariffs on countries that don't take climate action, to avoid ""carbon leakage."" It is a fairly modest plan. But the fact that it was his first priority is the problem. He has been vague, for example, about whether he is in favour of building pipelines east and west to divers- ify the customer base for our energy. Frankly, people have more immediate concerns, such as the president of the United States saying he wants to annex their country and plans to squeeze them economically until they submit to his will. If Trump follows through, as it appears he has every intention of doing, Canada's emissions growth will cease to be a problem because there will be no growth of any kind. The Leger poll suggests nearly nine in 10 Canadians are worried, if not stressed about it. The only source of consolation is that a roughly equal number say they feel pride in being Canadian, a significant increase on the number who said the same the last time the question was asked nearly a year ago. Carney has talked about us being masters in our own house; Poilievre has promised he will build a self-reliant, sovereign nation. The only way out of this mess is to choose a national leader who is resolute in defence of Canada, who is prepared to safeguard its economy and who is willing to use its natural resources to benefit all Canadians.

It will be Carney vs. Poilievre. And neither has clear advantage,2025.0,"The Liberal leadership race is effectively over and the 2025 Canadian general election just got a lot more interesting. As with swallows and summers, one poll does not define any political contest. But any Liberals who decide to vote for anyone other than Mark Carney after Leger's latest survey might as well form a circular firing squad. The poll suggested that the Conservative lead across the country has been whittled down to nine points from 18 points during the firm's last survey. Leger has Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives at 40 per cent support, compared to 31 per cent for the Liberals. However, Liberal support rises to 37 per cent when respondents were asked to consider Carney as leader, while the number of Conservative voters slips into a statistical dead heat. (Given the inefficiency of a Conservative vote heavily concentrated in the West, that would likely see the Liberals re-elected.) The bad news for Chrystia Freeland's leadership campaign is that with her as leader, Liberal support declines to 28 per cent and the Conservatives maintain a strong lead at 38 per cent. Liberal party members would have to be pretty dumb to ignore such obvious signals from the electorate, and when it comes to holding onto power, Liberals are not dumb. As mentioned, this is just one poll but the trendlines are supported by others. It is an exceptional turnaround in public sentiment, but we are living in a singular moment. When Justin Trudeau resigned just last month, most polling firms had the Conservatives ahead by more than 20 percentage points. Yet Poilievre's lead has always been predicated on deep enmity toward Trudeau, rather than an affection for the Conservative leader. Abacus Data polls consistently revealed that around one-third of those who said they supported Poilievre were parking their vote and could be persuaded to change their minds if a better alternative came along. For many of those people, Carney seems like the right person at the right time. The Leger poll suggests that eight out of 10 Canadians are concerned U.S. President Donald Trump will use tariffs to pressure Canada into a closer union with the U.S. Poilievre's ""axe the tax"" mantra resonates less loudly against the backdrop of potential annexation. The Conservative leader and Carney are in a statistical tie when it comes to being trusted to deal with Trump. But Carney has a clear advantage when it comes to experience in major crises. (I disclose, as I have before, that I have been friends with Carney for more than a decade.) The Conservatives have millions of dollars to paint the presumptive Liberal leader as ""Carbon Tax Carney"" or to denigrate his role as governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. But the facts remain: Carney was in the Cash Room at the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 with the other G7 finance ministers and central bankers when the decision was taken to backstop the banking system with liquidity to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression. He was chair of the Financial Stability Board, the international body that cleaned up the mess in the wake of the financial crisis. And he was the governor of the Bank of England who warned that Brexit would weaken the pound, undermine investment, lead to higher unemployment and cripple economic growth. (A 2021 report by the U.K. Office of Budget Responsibility calculated that Brexit will cost Britain four per cent of GDP per annum going forward or $57 billion a year). Against that, Poilievre's re - sume is, let's say, one-dimensional. The Conservative leader also sounds almost Trumpian in his rhetoric, in a way that could harm his cause with potential switch voters. That's not to suggest that he subscribes to Trump's delusional mercantilism or casual corruption. But in his Arctic security announcement this week, he talked of ""dramatically cutting foreign aid."" At a time when Trump is discarding allies, surely it would pay to do the opposite: to assert the value of soft power in the battle to win friends and influence people. Poilievre's sympathies are often too narrow for many voters who are not fully invested in his project. How many people were cheering him on this week, when he tweeted out that Carney was wearing $2,000 Zegna sneakers during a photo op? If there was ever a time to put away childish things, it is now. At the same time, Carney has baggage - not least the Liberal brand. Poilievre had a point when he said that the team of Trudeau ministers who are now backing Carney not only endorsed his agenda, they helped write it, push it and implement it. ""Keeping Trudeau's team is the same as keeping Trudeau."" The mere sight of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault endorsing Carney was probably enough for many Poilievre waverers to stiffen their spines. The sense that the Liberals need to be consigned to the penalty box remains strong and may be a decisive factor in the coming election. Then there is Carney himself. His defining mission in recent years has been climate action and it was telling that his first policy commitment was a plan that would dump the consumer carbon tax he says is now too divisive and replace it with a new approach that relies on financial incentives for appliances, cars and insulation.

"'Any level of damage': Harper would dig in against Trump; Independence worth heavy toll, former PM says",2025.0,"Stephen Harper told a crowd in Ottawa Tuesday that if he were still prime minister, he would accept ""any level of damage"" to Canada, rather than see it join the United States as the 51st state. ""I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" Harper said. The former prime minister was speaking before an invitation-only crowd to promote his new book, Flags of Canada, about the history of the Canadian flag. But, given the drama of Donald Trump's tariff threats against Canada and his now-repeated musings about Canada becoming the 51st state, Harper couldn't avoid touching on current affairs, according to a report in the Toronto Star. ""Now, because I do think that if Trump were deter-mined, he could really do wide structural and economic damage, but I wouldn't accept that,"" said Harper, according to the Star. ""I would accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country."" In recent weeks, Trump's rhetoric around Canada and Mexico has escalated. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was recently caught on a hot mic saying that he believes Trump's comments about annexing Canada - which he initially suggested was a joke over dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago - are ""a real thing"" In contrast, his defence minister, Bill Blair, said Wednesday that he thinks it is not a ""real threat."" The minister was in Brussels to meet with NATO allies and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. Blair and Trudeau had a breakfast meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte Wednesday morning. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Blair said that while Trump's comments are ""disrespectful and concerning,"" he doesn't see them as a serious threat. ""Certainly we're concerned about those remarks, and I think overwhelmingly for all Canadians those remarks are offensive. We're proud of our country,"" he said. ""We've assured all of our allies we're prepared to stand up for our country. I do not believe that represents a real threat to us."" At the moment, Canada and the United States are in a bit of a holding pattern over tariffs. A 30-day pause agreed to last week was upended earlier this week when Trump announced 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum effective March 12. The across-theboard U.S. tariffs could come into effect on March 4, if Canada's plan to step up border security doesn't pacify the president. Harper, who now runs a consultancy, said that while he was willing to impoverish Canada to maintain its independence, it would also be critical to have a plan to rebuild the country's economy. The vast majority of Canadian trade goes to our southern neighbour. ""Important in that is to have a plan of how we would reorient our economy, so we would recover that prosperity again, and not just solve the damage,"" Harper said. Since his defeat in 2015, Harper has rarely commented on Canadian public affairs. When he has spoken to the media - fewer than a half-dozen times in the past near-decade - it has often been to U.S. news podcasts, including in January when he shellacked Trudeau to a Florida podcaster and expressed shock at the way Trump has treated its closest ally. Harper also recently joined the four other living former prime ministers - Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin - to implore Canadians to fly the Canadian flag this Saturday, the 60th anniversary of its adoption. ""In the face of threats and insults from Donald Trump, Canadians have come together to express their love for our country and their determination to defend Canada's values and our independence,"" the five former leaders wrote. ""As former prime ministers of Canada, we applaud this national spirit. And we call on our fellow Canadians to show the flag as never before."" In fact, in Ottawa Tuesday, Harper did commend Trudeau for his patriotic fervour in the face of the Trump threats, the Star reported. Harper was speaking at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society office in Ottawa to promote his new book, which will be published Feb. 25. Harper spoke about how Canada had evolved from using the Union Jack and the Red Ensign before engaging in an intense debate under Lester B. Pearson to adopt the current Canadian flag.

"Carney's tenure could mirror Turner, Campbell; If new leader, honeymoon may be short",2025.0,"With a shocking new poll showing that Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is poised to win a general election against Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, he may be experiencing a phenomenon that would be familiar to two other former federal politicians in similar circumstances. Twice in the past 40 years, an unpopular federal government has shuffled in a new leader at the last minute tasked with immediately leading it into a general election. And in both cases, the new leader enjoyed a brief honeymoon of wild popularity before ultimately leading their party into electoral oblivion. John Turner was a Liberal prime minister for just 79 days before being on the receiving end of a devastating 1984 landslide victory by the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney. Kim Campbell had a Conservative premiership of 132 days before suffering a 1993 defeat in which her party lost 154 of its 156 seats. Both Turner and Campbell had taken over from long-term incumbents who had been driven out of office by spiralling unpopularity. And when both took the helm, polls showed them to be extremely popular and likely to win a general election. In Campbell's case, she was briefly one of the most popular Canadian prime ministers in history. Two months after her June 1993 swearing-in, a Gallup poll showed Campbell with an approval rating of 51 per cent against just 22 per cent who disapproved. That may not sound like much, but it's miraculously high for a job in which approval ratings frequently dwell in the low 40s. In the entire nine-year tenure of Justin Trudeau, there's only been a few months in which he could boast of a similar 29-point spread between approval and disapproval. At the time, Campbell's 51 per cent was the highest recorded for a prime minister in 30 years. It's all the more remarkable given that Campbell was taking over from a prime minister, Mulroney, whose disapproval rating had reached a record-breaking 83 per cent before his departure. For the first months of Campbell's time in the PMO, news coverage was mostly about how everyone liked her. In July 1993 - just three months before the election that would destroy her party - Campbell was easily poll - ing as the country's most popular choice for prime minister. A Gallup poll asked Canadians if they'd rather have Campbell or then Liberal leader Jean Chrétien as prime minister; 40 per cent said Campbell, with just 23 per cent saying Chrétien. Reporters spoke of ""Kimmanie"" - an overnight mania for the new Progressive Conservative leader in Quebec. When the writs for the 1993 election were eventually dropped, frustrated letter-writers bemoaned how quickly Kim-crazed Canadians seemed to have forgotten their distaste of the party that Campbell represented. ""Have we such short memories that we forget she was part of the Mulroney government that everyone loved to hate?"" read a September 1993 letter to the Hamilton Spectator. ""Let's be honest, what has Kim Campbell done to deserve this popularity?"" Chrétien at the time confidently called Campbell's popularity a ""mirage."" ""She wants a different image, but the (Tory) economic policies will remain the same,"" he said. Campbell herself even seemed to be skeptical of her brief and ultimately doomed honeymoon with voters. When asked why polls were showing her to be so beloved, she cheekily answered, ""when the polls are good, then they're very serious and accurate reflections of what the public think. When they're not good, they are simply but mere transitory reflections of ephemeral moods not to be taken seriously."" Her and Chrétien's skepticism may have been fuelled by the fact that Canada was only nine years removed from a similar honeymoon with Turner that also led to disaster. Much as Carney has polled for years as the preferred successor for Justin Trudeau, Turner had been the preferred alternative to then Liberal leader Pierre Trudeau since at least the 1970s. Polls from the time showed that if Turner had been prime minister in 1979, the Liberals would likely not have lost the election to Joe Clark. As such, when Turner finally got the job in 1984, polls immediately started showing a surprise boost for the Liberals. A Gallup poll conducted during the Liberal leadership race was said to have ""shocked the nation"" by showing the party with a sixpoint lead - an unbelievable turnaround for a party that had spent years scraping new depths of unpopularity under the elder Trudeau. When Turner called a federal election shortly after his June 30 swearing-in, he enjoyed a comfortable lead. Three separate pollsters gave his Liberals a 10-point advantage over the Progressive Conservatives; more than enough for Turner to win a majority. But as would happen with Campbell, the refreshing change of a new face in the Prime Minister's Office would dissolve almost immediately once voters remembered the party and policies he represented. For Turner, his popularity would never recover after a moment in the English-language leaders' debate in which he appeared to defend an 11th hour wave of patronage appointments made by the outgoing Pierre Trudeau. After Turner said he ""had no option"" to cancel the unpopular appointments, Mulroney famously responded ""you had an option, sir."" The phrase now has its own Wikipedia page, which should indicate how badly it went for Turner.

""As former prime ministers of Canada, we applaud this national spirit. And we call on our fellow Canadians to show the flag as never before."" In fact, in Ottawa Tuesday, Harper did commend Trudeau for his patriotic fervour in the face of the Trump threats, the Star reported. Harper was speaking at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society office in Ottawa to promote his new book, which will be published Feb. 25. Harper spoke about how Canada had evolved from using the Union Jack and the Red Ensign before engaging in an intense debate under Lester B. Pearson to adopt the current Canadian flag.

"Mayor, councillors spent fraction of travel budget; Davies, Donauer, Jeffries, Loewen, Clark journeyed to other cities for conferences",2025.0,"Travel and training expenses - in amounts ranging from $78 to $8,800 - claimed by Saskatoon's mayor and council will be up for discussion this week. Council's governance and priorities committee on Wednesday is scheduled to look over those expenses for 2024 from former mayor Charlie Clark and current Mayor Cynthia Block, as well as from the current and former city councillors. TRAVEL AND TRAINING Each councillor has a budget for general travel and training, including to attend events such as the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA) convention or the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) conference. A common travel and training budget is also provided to attend annual conferences or board meetings of any organization - such as FCM or the Canadian Urban Transit Association - to which a councillor is appointed as an official city representative or as a board member. Much of the expenses claimed in 2024 stemmed from councillors attending the Federation of Canadian Municipalities conference in Calgary. Coun. Troy Davies spent $2,226.39 to attend, while Coun. Randy Donauer spent $3,032.71. Coun. Zach Jeffries spent $3,087.18 for meetings in Ottawa that included FCM business, meetings at Ottawa's mayor's office and time with multiple federal ministers. The remainder of councillors either had no travel or training expenses or spent less than $800. The total amount of individual spending on travel and training was $9,595.36. Out of the common travel and training expenses, $7,560.89 was spent by two councillors: $7,520.89 by Coun. Mairin Loewen for meetings and conferences related to the FCM in Prince George, B.C., Calgary and Ottawa. - $40 spent by Donauer related to a SUMA sector meeting. Former mayor Charlie Clark had travel expenses of $8,828.12 on trips to Ottawa, Regina, Calgary, Victoria, B.C., and Winnipeg for meetings that included FCM's Big City Mayors' Caucus, SUMA and the Victoria Forum. Block expensed $78 on travel to attend the Throne Speech in Regina. CAR ALL OWAN CES For two decades, councillors have been reimbursed for using their personal vehicles for city business. Councillors receive a rate - set by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) - of 70 cents for the first 5,000 kilometres driven and 64 cents thereafter. Last year, Coun. Bev Dubois claimed $3,315.20, Jeffries claimed $2,485.70, former Coun. David Kirton claimed $1,764.70, Davies claimed $1,386 and former Coun. Darren Hill claimed $1,178.80 All other councillors either did not claim a vehicle allowance, or claimed under $600. Clark claimed $1,425.25 on a vehicle allowance while Block claimed $87.36 as mayor and nothing while a councillor. HOW MUCH IS BUDGETED? The total budget for individual travel and training in 2024 for all councillors was $35,000, but only $9,595.36 was spent. The total budgeted for common travel and training was $24,000, but only $7,560.89 was spent. The budgeted amounts were pro-rated because 2024 was an election year. Sitting councillors were allocated $29,050 from the total individual travel and training amount; after the election, they were able to access the remaining two months of budgeted funds. Some travel and training are paid for by other sources, including for councillors on the board of police commissioners. In that case, expenses come out of the police budget.","Star - Phoenix; Saskatoon, Sask.","Saskatoon, Sask.",Brody Langager,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 12, 2025",Meetings; Mayors; Travel & entertainment expenses; Training,Nom: Federation of Canadian Municipalities; NAICS: 925120,2025-02-12,Star - Phoenix
Poilievre says he'll build permanent military base in Arctic; Border Security,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is promising to build a new military base in Canada's Arctic to bolster its security against threats from China and Russia. Poilievre made the announcement during a news conference Monday in Iqaluit and in a slickly produced video. It comes as Poilievre, who for the past two years has been prosecuting the Liberal government's record on the cost of living, is shifting his focus to Canadian security, at a time when Canadians are also becoming increas- ingly concerned with statements by U.S. President Donald Trump. ""We cannot count on the Americans to do it for us anymore,"" Poilievre said. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the ""51st state"" and on Sun - day promised to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum entering the U.S., including from Canada. He also said he would match any tariff another country placed on U.S. goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in Paris attending an event on artificial intelligence, but has said that should the U.S. make good on its threat of imposing tariffs, as Trump has threatened to do on all Canadian imports, the federal government would retaliate. Poilievre has been among political leaders calling on the Liberals to reinforce border security. During his announcement Monday, the Conservative leader promised that should Canadians elect him as their next prime minister, he would not only build a new permanent Arctic base within two years called CFB Iqaluit, but also double the size of the Canadian Rangers and acquire four new polar icebreakers - two for the coast guard and two for the navy.

Poilievre revives 'use it or lose it' Arctic plan,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre's announcement in Iqaluit that a Conservative government would build a permanent military base in the Arctic, and order two more heavy icebreakers, had deliberate echoes with the defence policy of his predecessor as leader, Stephen Harper. Nearly 20 years ago, Harper grafted onto an issue that was considered a curiosity by his opponents: militarizing the Canadian Arctic. Canada had a choice when it came to defending its sovereignty in the North: ""either we use it or lose it,"" he said on one of his annual trips to the region in 2007. His government intended to ""use it"" and indicated a ""real, growing, long-term presence"" in the Arctic by announcing plans to refur- bish a deepwater port on a former mining site at Nanisivik in Nunavut in addition to ordering up to eight ""ice-capable"" Arctic patrol ships. While five of the patrol ships have been delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy by Irving Shipyards in Halifax, not much remains of Harper's legacy project. Nanisivik, which was meant to open in 2015, is a decade behind schedule, and the enthusiasm for ""using"" the North waned, as other priorities emerged. But Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine shook the Trudeau government's sense of complacency. ""What was a relatively benign threat suddenly became an existential threat,"" said Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, a retired Royal Canadian Navy officer and ex-vice-chief of the defence staff. As Poilievre put it, our safety and trade with the United States requires that Canada control its North. Given the noises being made by President Donald Trump, who said on Sunday that Canada can no longer depend on the U.S. for military protection, Poilievre's timing was impeccable. The reality is that Ottawa has already awoken from a decade of slumber when it comes to the Arctic. The defence-policy update released last year - Our North, Strong and Free - re - directed Canada's focus from expeditionary ventures overseas to defending the homeland. Norman said that represented a major cultural shift for the military, which had for decades concentrated almost exclusively on large expeditionary capabilities as part of NATO. The Trudeau government had already reached agreement with the Biden administration to contribute $29 billion over 20 years to modernize the North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad), paying for two of six Arctic radar installations and building infrastructure such as hangars and runways to allow the new F-35 fighter jet fleet to operate in the North. Defence Minister Bill Blair has committed to up to 12 submarines to replace the four aging Victoria-class subs and has mused about the need to develop underwater surveillance capabil- ities in the Arctic (without attaching any funding to either project). At last July's NATO summit, Canada, the U.S. and Finland agreed to collaborate on the production of polar icebreakers. Canada already has orders in place for two icebreakers for the coast guard. Poilievre's commitment would be in addition to those. He has promised to make the existing facility in Iqaluit into a permanent military base, allowing the new P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft to operate from there. The Conservative leader further said he would double the number of Canadian Rangers who are active in the North. The commitments would be paid for by making ""drastic"" cuts in foreign aid - a promise he should reconsider in light of the Trump administration's funding freeze for USAID. Even maintaining aid budgets would purchase Canada a great deal of goodwill around the world in these ungenerous times. The problem with many of Canada's pledges of new equipment in the North is that the Russians and Chi- nese may have taken advantage of their absence by the time they are delivered. Russia has established Arctic deepwater ports, complete with military icebreakers and airfields with SU-34 bombers. It has also submitted documentation with the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf that essentially claims the entire Arctic Ocean. China has three icebreakers already operating in the Arctic, in co-operation with the Russians, and the two countries have signed a joint communiqué to develop shipping routes and polar ship technology. Canada's hold on the Arctic is, in the words of former defence chief Wayne Eyre, ""tenuous"" - and it is like - ly to become more so with Trump in office. In his first term in office, Trump proposed buying Greenland and dismissed as illegitimate Canada's claim that the Northwest Passage is an internal waterway. The language Trump is using has provoked a visceral reaction in Canada. ""Why are we protecting another country?"" he asked on Fox News on Sunday. But, as Norman points out, the president is calling for this country to do what it should have done a long time ago. ""When you take your foot off the gas, you run out of momentum. Now we find ourselves legitimately called out for our lack of commitment and action."" He said the moves Poilievre announced are steps in the right direction. Iqaluit is a pre-existing hub, even if it is a long way from the Far North and has a shallow port. ""It's the best of a not-great set of options,"" Norman said. ""(But) we have to act strategically, like a serious country."" The consequences of not doing so would leave Canada exposed. Norman said he is concerned that Trump might take a wrecking ball to Norad, in the same manner he has disrupted so many other arrangements. That would leave this country scrambling to create its own capabilities. We are a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan visited Ottawa in 1987 and Brian Mulroney raised the issue of U.S. encroachment in the Northwest Passage. An accord was eventually reached under which the U.S. agreed to ask permission and Canada agreed to say yes. Such co-operation seems almost quaint in today's antagonistic environment. But there are good reasons why the U.S. and Canada are natural allies in continental defence. ""The reality is, we're the buffer between them and the Russians, and we've used that to our advantage,"" Norman said. ""This is not about American generosity, it's about a legitimate sense of military practicality."" If Canada's claims in the region are backed with hard power, Trump should be as placated as he is ever going to be.

Ex-minister's book would give Poilievre insight on cuts' effects,2025.0,"Re: Poilievre says the Charter supports locking up drug kingpins without using the notwithstanding clause Re: Mandate of fentanyl czar should be broader, former senior Mountie says It is rare to find two articles dealing with the same topic in the same edition. One deals with Poilievre's solution to the fentanyl crisis - passing legislation and locking drug criminals up - and the other deals with a prescription from an experienced former RCMP deputy commissioner, Peter German. And what a contrast in the two approaches to the problem. Poilievre believes the present laws allow him to incarcerate all who deal in fentanyl, especially the kingpins. Even if that is so, are there enough prisons, guards, police, courts, judges and all the people it takes to accomplish what he says? Are all the drug kingpins in Canada? How about the drug kingpins that are scattered all over the world? How can this be possible while campaigning for tax cuts, a smaller government and a balanced budget? What programs is he going to cut in order to achieve this? I suggest Poilievre consult with George Abbott, a former minister in the Gordon Campbell government. Abbott wrote a book - titled Big Promises, Small Government - on the effects of tax cuts, small government and balanced budgets. Campbell's policy resulted in dumpster fires in provincial corporations, new service fees for government services, including MSP premiums for British Columbians. I tend to believe that German's prescription has a better chance to succeed than Poilievre's. His slogan ""stop the drugs"" sounds hollow to me.","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Consiglio, John",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 11, 2025",Tax cuts; Fentanyl,,2025-02-11,The Vancouver Sun

Poilievre pledges to expand Arctic defences; We cannot count on the Americans,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre vowed to build a new permanent military base in Iqaluit to be called CFB Iqaluit should he become the country's next prime minister, as a way to assert Canada's Arctic sovereignty amid growing threats from Russia and China. ""We cannot count on the Americans to do it for us any more,"" he said during a news conference in the territorial capital on Monday. Poilievre, who is leading in national polls, said the military base would be built within his first two years as prime minister. His plan would also double the number of the Canadian Rangers to 4,000 and provide four new icebreakers, two for the Canadian Coast Guard and two for the Navy. It would be financed by ""dramatically cutting foreign aid,"" much of which, he said, ""goes to dictators, terrorists and global bureaucracies."" Canada spent about C$15.5 billion on international assistance in 202223, and Poilievre's promise follows President Donald Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. ""The Canadian Arctic is under threat,"" Poilievre said in a video of his plan posted on Monday. ""Hostile powers want our resources, our shipping routes and to be within striking distance of our continent. Our safety, territory and trade with the U.S. requires we take back control of Canada's North,"" Poilievre said. Poilievre's push is part of a new suite of policies he's dubbing his ""Canada First"" plan, in the face of Trump's tariff threats and his insistence the country should become a U.S. state. Trump cited Arctic security as a reason for his renewed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark. The U.S. president has also long complained about Canada and European countries being laggards when it comes to their defence spending. ""Canada will never be the 51st state. We are a proud, sovereign and independent country,"" Poilievre said. Canada's Arctic makes up about 40 per cent of the country's land mass and 75 per cent of its coastlines. In recent years, its military forces have found Chinese monitoring buoys and encountered a Chinese polar vessel in the region, where Russia is also modernizing and growing its military presence. The Trudeau government has also expanded its plans to defend the Arctic, making the region a focus of its defence policy update last year and pledging to buy up to 12 under-ice capable submarines. Still, the northern nation has never met the North Atlantic Treaty Organization target of spending two per cent on defence since agreeing to it in 2006. Poilievre said he would complete the submarine purchase as well as other Liberal government commitments to defence, including modernizing the North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad). But he promised a Conservative government would deliver these plans faster by ""eliminating red tape and delays."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters in Windsor, Ont., on Monday he agrees Canada should reinforce its military presence in the Arctic, saying NDP MP Lori Idlout, the lone member for Nunavut, has raised the issue before. A federal election is due by October but could be called sooner. All opposition parties have said they will vote no confidence to bring down Trudeau's minority Liberal government at the first opportunity. Parliament reopens on March 24.

Given the noises being made by President Donald Trump, who said on Sunday that Canada can no longer depend on the U.S. for military protection, Poilievre's timing was impeccable. The reality is that Ottawa has already awoken from a decade of slumber when it comes to the Arctic. The defence-policy update released last year - Our North, Strong and Free - re - directed Canada's focus from expeditionary ventures overseas to defending the homeland. Norman said that represented a major cultural shift for the military, which had for decades concentrated almost exclusively on large expeditionary capabilities as part of NATO. The Trudeau government had already reached agreement with the Biden administration to contribute $29 billion over 20 years to modernize the North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad), paying for two of six Arctic radar installations and building infrastructure such as hangars and runways to allow the new F-35 fighter jet fleet to operate in the North. Defence Minister Bill Blair has committed to up to 12 submarines to replace the four aging Victoria-class subs and has mused about the need to develop underwater surveillance capabil- ities in the Arctic (without attaching any funding to either project). At last July's NATO summit, Canada, the U.S. and Finland agreed to collaborate on the production of polar icebreakers. Canada already has orders in place for two icebreakers for the coast guard. Poilievre's commitment would be in addition to those. He has promised to make the existing facility in Iqaluit into a permanent military base, allowing the new P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft to operate from there. The Conservative leader further said he would double the number of Canadian Rangers who are active in the North. The commitments would be paid for by making ""drastic"" cuts in foreign aid - a promise he should reconsider in light of the Trump administration's funding freeze for USAID. Even maintaining aid budgets would purchase Canada a great deal of goodwill around the world in these ungenerous times. The problem with many of Canada's pledges of new equipment in the North is that the Russians and Chi- nese may have taken advantage of their absence by the time they are delivered. Russia has established Arctic deepwater ports, complete with military icebreakers and airfields with SU-34 bombers. It has also submitted documentation with the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf that essentially claims the entire Arctic Ocean. China has three icebreakers already operating in the Arctic, in co-operation with the Russians, and the two countries have signed a joint communiqué to develop shipping routes and polar ship technology. Canada's hold on the Arctic is, in the words of former defence chief Wayne Eyre, ""tenuous"" - and it is like - ly to become more so with Trump in office. In his first term in office, Trump proposed buying Greenland and dismissed as illegitimate Canada's claim that the Northwest Passage is an internal waterway. The language Trump is using has provoked a visceral reaction in Canada. ""Why are we protecting another country?"" he asked on Fox News on Sunday. But, as Norman points out, the president is calling for this country to do what it should have done a long time ago. ""When you take your foot off the gas, you run out of momentum. Now we find ourselves legitimately called out for our lack of commitment and action."" He said the moves Poilievre announced are steps in the right direction. Iqaluit is a pre-existing hub, even if it is a long way from the Far North and has a shallow port. ""It's the best of a not-great set of options,"" Norman said. ""(But) we have to act strategically, like a serious country."" The consequences of not doing so would leave Canada exposed. Norman said he is concerned that Trump might take a wrecking ball to Norad, in the same manner he has disrupted so many other arrangements. That would leave this country scrambling to create its own capabilities. We are a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan visited Ottawa in 1987 and Brian Mulroney raised the issue of U.S. encroachment in the Northwest Passage. An accord was eventually reached under which the U.S. agreed to ask permission and Canada agreed to say yes. Such co-operation seems almost quaint in today's antagonistic environment. But there are good reasons why the U.S. and Canada are natural allies in continental defence. ""The reality is, we're the buffer between them and the Russians, and we've used that to our advantage,"" Norman said. ""This is not about American generosity, it's about a legitimate sense of military practicality."" If Canada's claims in the region are backed with hard power, Trump should be as placated as he is ever going to be.

Poilievre says he'll build permanent military base in Arctic; Border Security,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is promising to build a new military base in Canada's Arctic to bolster its security against threats from China and Russia. Poilievre made the announcement during a news conference Monday in Iqaluit and in a slickly produced video. It comes as Poilievre, who for the past two years has been prosecuting the Liberal government's record on the cost of living, is shifting his focus to Canadian security, at a time when Canadians are also becoming increas- ingly concerned with statements by U.S. President Donald Trump. ""We cannot count on the Americans to do it for us anymore,"" Poilievre said. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the ""51st state"" and on Sun - day promised to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum entering the U.S., including from Canada. He also said he would match any tariff another country placed on U.S. goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in Paris attending an event on artificial intelligence, but has said that should the U.S. make good on its threat of imposing tariffs, as Trump has threatened to do on all Canadian imports, the federal government would retaliate. Poilievre has been among political leaders calling on the Liberals to reinforce border security. During his announcement Monday, the Conservative leader promised that should Canadians elect him as their next prime minister, he would not only build a new permanent Arctic base within two years called CFB Iqaluit, but also double the size of the Canadian Rangers and acquire four new polar icebreakers - two for the coast guard and two for the navy.

"Ford blasts China ahead of U.S. trip:   PC leader would ban Chinese parts and firms from critical energy, mineral and infrastructure projects",2025.0,"Ontario's election campaign is taking a detour to Washington, D.C. - thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff gambit. Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford, who chairs the Council of the Federation, is leading a delegation there Tuesday to lobby American lawmakers and business leaders. At midday, Ford will give a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business organization, before he and a dozen provincial and territorial leaders meet elected officials to share their concerns about Trump's moves. The chamber has warned the president against imposing tariffs because the levies would hurt businesses and consumers on both sides of the border. In the evening, Ford will co-host a reception at the Library of Congress for premiers and U.S. lawmakers with South Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, a key Trump ally who co-chairs the bipartisan American Canadian economy and security caucus. The Ontarian will make a second visit to the U.S. capital on Feb. 20 to discuss the trade crisis with delegates to the National Governors' Association winter conference. His two trips are coming in the middle of a snap Feb. 27 election Ford triggered because he wanted a new four-year mandate to ""outlive and outlast"" the Trump administration. Revving up for his unusual stateside push, Ford was taking aim at China on Monday. The PC leader said he would ban Chinese parts from energy projects and prohibit participation by any Chinese state-owned enterprises in critical mineral or infrastructure projects if elected to a third term. Trump's latest scheme to place 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum - despite a pledge last week to hold off on any levies until March - shows why Ontario must be flexible, Ford told reporters in Oakville after a fundraising breakfast. ""We're going to face this for four years, shifting goalposts constantly and constant chaos,"" he said. While he has focused his campaign on fighting tariffs, he suffered a setback a week ago when he was caught on a ""hot mic"" saying that he ""100 per cent"" supported Trump to win the November U.S. election over Kamala Harris. ""We're in a battle for the future of our economy,"" Ford said Monday, emphasizing it's crucial to convince Americans that U.S.-Canada economic co-operation is the best way to meet trade threats from China and put Trump off his talk of making Canada the 51st state. ""I'm going to tell them exactly what I'm telling you, Ontario is taking action to secure our border and delivering results."" Previously planned moves to take U.S. spirits, wines and beers off LCBO shelves and ban American companies from major contracts remain on hold for now, the PC leader said. ""Let's first see what he's going do to,"" he added, sending a signal south of the border that Canada as a whole has a plan for a ""hard"" response. ""We are not going to roll over. There's one thing that President Trump has underestimated - the will of the Canadian people,"" said Ford. ""We never started a fight we don't want. But when someone you know gives you a pop in the nose, they're going to get that pop twice as hard back."" In Toronto, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said the tough talk from Ford is ironic given the Tory's professed admiration for Trump in last week's headline-grabbing gaffe. Crombie noted the president campaigned on placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico during the U.S. election. Her Liberals are airing television ads they hope will draw widespread public attention to that and eat into Ford's current lead in public opinion polls. ""We're showing him for who he is, someone who wanted a self-serving election,"" said Crombie, whose campaign has been mostly about improving health care by guaranteeing every Ontarian access to a family doctor. ""You don't see another premier who would think of calling an election at a time of crisis, when we're responding to a tariff threat, and a president who wants to wage a trade war and our premier supports that president,"" she said. New Democrat Leader Marit Stiles, who met with steelworkers in Hamilton on Monday morning after highlighting her push for a higher nurse-to-patient ratio in hospitals to improve care, said Ford is exploiting the trade crisis to divert attention from pressing issues on the home front. ""Doug Ford doesn't want to talk about the fact that people in Ontario are losing their family members in hallways in our hospitals because there aren't enough beds and there aren't enough nurses,"" Stiles told supporters in Port Colborne before taking a shot at Ford's support for Trump. ""Doug Ford has shown us what he's made of,"" she added. ""I don't think we can trust Doug Ford to stand up for Ontarians and to protect all our jobs and defend our workers and our communities."" Along with Green Leader Mike Schreiner, the party chiefs are gearing up for a Friday debate on northern issues in North Bay and another next Monday night in Toronto at the CBC Broadcast Centre.

PC leadership hopeful criticized for homeless comments,2025.0,"Tory leadership candidate Wally Daudrich is in hot water for a joke he made about the homeless at a rally this week. Daudrich, who runs a polar bear ecotour in Churchill, made the quip minutes into his speech at a rally at the Park West Inn in Winnipeg’s Charleswood neighbourhood. “We have a homeless crisis here in Winnipeg,” Daudrich told supporters in a video posted on social media. “I always say where I come from in Churchill, we don’t have any homeless people. Anybody take a guess why? “When there are serious repercussions for a bad lifestyle, people smarten up very quickly. So my plan is to import 10 polar bears and let them go in front of the (Manitoba legislature).” End Homelessness Winnipeg called the remarks “hurtful” and “deeply damaging.” “Such statements perpetuate harmful stereotypes, diminish the struggles of those experiencing homelessness and ignore the complex, systemic issues that lead people into housing insecurity,” the non-profit said in a release Friday. In an interview Friday, Daudrich said he won’t apologize. He said homelessness is primarily caused by drug addiction, and he’s against drug addiction. “Obviously being out on the streets has serious repercussions and that is the point of the comment,” he said. “It’s a joke. There’s no apology. I’ll probably say it again next week.” The longtime PC board member is running against Fort Whyte MLA Obby Khan to become the next leader of the provincial Tories, who have not had a permanent leader since former premier Heather Stefanson resigned in 2024. Khan issued a statement about the comment. “I must condemn my opponent for his callous attack on the homeless community in Manitoba. His sick joke does not represent my views as a sitting PC MLA or of other Manitobans concerned about addressing this very serious issue,” he wrote. End Homelessness said poverty is a result of the lack of affordable housing, mental health challenges and trauma, among other inequities. “The First Nations teaching of humility, represented by the wolf, reminds us to approach life with respect, listen with open hearts and acknowledge that we are all interconnected,” said CEO Jason Whitford. “These teachings are universal, transcending cultures and faiths, calling on us to uplift others rather than bring them down.” The organization said Indigenous communities in particular continue to face the impacts of colonialism, including housing discrimination and intergenerational trauma. “These issues require solutions, not ridicule.” — with files from The Canadian Press scott.billeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Scott Billeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Billeck, Scott",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 8, 2025",Leadership; Homeless people,,2025-02-08,Winnipeg Free Press
Poilievre says Charter allows locking up drug kingpins; Fentanyl crisis,2025.0,"OTTAWA. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he's not worried about the Charter of Rights and Freedoms getting in the way of his promise to lock away drug dealers if he becomes prime minister, including by imposing mandatory life sentences on ""fentanyl kingpins."" He says the Charter itself calls for tough criminal laws targeting fentanyl pushers ... if you look at it a certain way. ""What I am proposing today is not only allowed under the Charter, it is required by the Charter,"" said Poilievre, when asked if he was prepared to use Section 33 of the Charter, the notwithstanding clause, to insulate mandatory minimum prison sentences for fentanyl-related crimes from the courts. ""Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees life, liberty and security of the person,"" said Poilievre. ""Fifty-thousand people had their Section 7 right to life violated by the open borders, soft-on-crime, legaldrugs policy of the Liberals,"" he added, referring to the estimated number of Canadians who've succumbed to opioid-related deaths since 2016. Poilievre said that judges ""are going to be obliged"" to uphold the law he's promising, given its clear intent of preventing future spirals of addiction and drug-related deaths. The Opposition Leader was speaking at a policy announcement at the Port of Vancouver. Earlier in the day, Poilievre issued a press release promising mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of trafficking, producing or exporting more than 40 milligrams of fentanyl, as well as mandatory 15-year sentences for traffickers caught with between 20 and 40 milligrams. The illegal distribution of fentanyl, a Schedule 1 drug, carries a maximum life sen- tence under existing criminal law. The Supreme Court of Canada recently upheld a provincial decision setting a nine-year sentence as a non-mandatory ""starting point"" for wholesale fentanyl trafficking. Two milligrams of fentanyl is generally considered to be a fatal dose for the average person, although long-term users may develop a tolerance for much larger quantities. Joanna Baron, executive director of the Canadian Constitution Foundation, says she doesn' t share Poilievre's confidence about the promised mandatory minimums passing constitutional muster. ""The bottom line is if he wants to do this, he'll need to invoke Section 33,"" said Baron. Baron said that the quantities of fentanyl tied to mandatory minimums would be hard to defend in court, opening the door to a challenge for cruel and unusual punishment. ""It's easy to imagine a scenario where an addict has 20 to 40 milligrams (of fentanyl) on their person, and is dealing (drugs) under some kind of duress,"" said Baron. A recent analysis by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency found that nearly half of illicit fentanyl tablets contain at least two milligrams of the substance, meaning it could take just 10 tablets to put someone over Poilievre's promised threshold for mandatory minimum sentences. Poilievre hasn't said definitively that he'll use Section 33 to push through a more tough-on-crime agenda, but has said he'll reverse the Liberals' Bill C-5. Bill C-5, passed in 2022, eliminated more than a dozen mandatory minimum penalties on the books, including all mandatory minimums for drug-related offences, bringing the Criminal Code in line with major Supreme Court decisions striking down such penalties.

Sudbury PC candidate says 'we need a seat' in government,2025.0,"A Sudbury businessman running for the Progressive Conservatives in the Feb. 27 provincial election says the riding needs 'a voice at the table' if it wants to progress. Max Massimiliano talked about why he's running as he opened his campaign headquarters on The Kingsway on Wednesday. A father of three, Massimiliano co-owns Don's Pizza on Lorne Street and is ""a proud first-generation son of Italian immigrants."" ""I decided to run because we need a voice at the table with the party in power and I feel like the Sudbury area has been missing out on an immense amount of provincial funding that's gone to other Northern communities ... North Bay, Ste. Marie and Timmins have prospered over the years and we need a seat at that table."" The Progressive Conservatives now hold the North Bay, Ste. Marie and Timmins in northeastern Ontario. Two of those MPs - Vic Fedeli (North Bay) and George Pirie (Timmins) served in Premier Doug Ford's most recent cabinet. The Sudbury riding is now held by the NDP's Jamie West, who has served two terms as MPP and was his party's Labour critic. West is running again as is Dave Sylvestre for the None of the Above Party. The Liberals and Greens do not yet have a candidate in Sudbury. The Tories last held the Sudbury riding when Jim Gordon, a popular former mayor, served two terms from 1981 to 1987. Premier Doug Ford, who has called an election early (he didn't need to go to the polls until 2026), is hoping to win a third majority government. The PC's currently have 79 members in the provincial parliament, followed by the NDP at 28 and the Liberals at nine. There are six Independents and two Green party members. I decided to run because we need a voice at the table with the party in power. The polls this time around suggest Ford will easily win the next election and form another majority government. Ford said he called the election because he needs a strong mandate to deal with tariffs that American president Donald Trump is threatening to impose on Canada. When asked about his priorities for Sudbury if elected, Massimiliano was not specific. ""I think that there's many priorities for the city that need to be addressed and I'm just doing this for the whole of Sudbury, for all the constituents, for all Sudbury to make sure that it's a better place for myself, my kids and my parents to stay and live in,"" he said. In an email sent by his campaign team, Massimiliano said he's ""passionate about Sudbury's future, ensuring that our economy remains strong, our industries thrive, and the people who power them have the opportunities they deserve."" ""He is genuinely proud of our hometown,"" the email added. ""A dedicated father of three daughters, Max is actively involved in the community, coaching youth soccer and always supporting local initiatives through fundraising efforts.""

Ford wants pressure kept up on Trump; PC leader defends hot mic comments during Ottawa campaign stop,2025.0,"Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford had a fire in his belly and was talking bourbon Tuesday as he addressed U.S. President Donald Trump and his on-again, off-again promises to impose stiff tariffs on Canadian goods. After Trump hit the pause button on planned 25 per cent tariffs Monday, Ford reversed course on his plan to have U.S. alcohol removed from LCBO shelves. That would have included everything from California wine to Kentucky bourbon. Ford wants to continue to negotiate with Trump, who says he will revisit the tariff question March 1. But Ford says the change in the president's tone early this week is at least partly the result of hearing loud complaints from those against his tax plan, including U.S. alcohol producers worried about lost sales in Canada. ""It's about working together and explaining to the American people,"" Ford said during a provincial election campaign stop at an east Ottawa window and door manufacturing company. ""That's where the pressure comes. The pressure comes from the senators, the governors, the congresswomen and men who are getting calls from their constituents, shouting up and down and screaming."" The LCBO, Ford says, carries 3,600 products from 35 U.S. states and 2,000 companies. ""There's one thing I've learned,"" he said. ""Don't mess with people's booze. They lose their minds. People love their bourbon. It's their country, their state, their religion and then bourbon, in Kentucky ... That's how it goes."" At the same time, Ford says, nobody can afford to relax, believing that Trump has completely abandoned his tariff plan. As much as he dislikes Trump's approach, Ford acknowledges that the U.S. president was a smart negotiator and said, ""Uncertainty is the only certainty."" ""We have to work together and we have been working together,"" Ford said, hammering home the point that discussions can't be one-sided in making sure the U.S. doesn't take advantage of Ontario. ""I'm talking about the most serious situation the country has ever seen. I think it's even more serious than the pandemic. This is someone who is targeting Ontario. You know why he's targeting Ontario? Because we're an economic powerhouse now."" Indeed, the looming presence of Trump is here, there and everywhere during the Ontario election. Without his loud words and daily social media rants, Ontario's housing and health issues would be at the forefront of the campaign. Instead, Ford spent a good part of Tuesday's session with reporters talking about a hot mic incident on Monday. Ford was heard saying that he had been happy Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election until Trump went on his tariff crusade. ""I can work with anyone, I don't care who it is. I just thought things might be a little different,"" Ford said. ""I believe in people that want to put money back into people's pockets. I believe in elected officials, no matter what stripe, lowering taxes on people, on businesses. That's economics 101."" Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles and Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie were also on the campaign trail Tuesday and said Ford's live mic incident spoke volumes. ""I think the fact that he keeps saying one thing in front of you and another thing behind doors tells you everything you need to know about Doug Ford,"" Stiles said. Crombie said the comments revealed what Ford was all about. ""I think that statement, caught on a hot mic, when he didn't know other people could be listening, shows his true character,"" Crombie said. kwarren@postmedia.com","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.","Warren, Ken",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 6, 2025",Provincial elections; Political campaigns; Tariffs,,2025-02-06,The Ottawa Citizen
"Ex-PC staffers accused of promising to help developer's rezoning for pay:   Lawyer for former aides calls lawsuit 'baseless,' says clients followed the law",2025.0,"The former Ford government staffer at the centre of the Greenbelt scandal is being sued by a property developer who accuses him of promising to use his position of power to get his land rezoned. In exchange, the lawsuit alleges, Ryan Amato and former Ford staffer Shiv Raj would be discreetly paid by the developer for their ""lobbying services."" Both men were working for the government at the time of the alleged agreement. The allegations are made by Oakville property owner Amanpreet Jakhar, as well as two numbered companies that own properties in London and Grimsby. Jakhar and the companies are suing Amato and Raj, as well as construction company Frontier Group of Companies Inc., and Frontier's founder and vice-president, for $2.2 million, accusing all defendants of negligence, breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, conspiracy and other offences. None of the allegations have been proven, and all of the defendants have told the court they intend to defend against the action. The lawsuit was first reported by the Trillium. Joshua Henderson, the lawyer for both Raj and Amato, said in a statement that the lawsuit ""contains false and baseless accusations,"" and that both Raj and Amato ""acted in full compliance with the law and will defend any claims to the contrary in court if called upon to do so."" The lawyer for Frontier Group and its executives wrote in an email that his clients were not prepared to comment. ""Having said that, do keep in mind that the allegations in the lawsuit are simply that,"" said Constantine Alexiou. ""My clients will vigorously defend the claim, as necessary."" The lawsuit claims Amato and Raj said they would use their ""back-channel contacts and political connections"" to secure rezoning approvals during a meeting in the summer of 2023. That August, Amato resigned from his post as chief of staff to former housing minister Steve Clark after an auditor general's report identified him as the architect of the province's since-reversed scheme to open up parts of the Greenbelt to housing. The initial plan, the auditor general found, would have enriched a select group of well-connected developers by more than $8 billion. A subsequent Integrity Commissioner report concluded that Amato was ""the driving force behind a flawed process which provided an advantage to those who approached him."" The RCMP has been investigating the scandal since October 2023. Raj worked in Ford's office from 2018 to 2023, according to his LinkedIn profile, and he is currently working on Ford's re-election campaign team. A spokesperson for Ford's campaign said Ford is unaware of the lawsuit and the province has no involvement in it. The spokesperson added that the Ford government has never considered any changes to the three properties in question. Following an initial meeting in the summer of 2023, Jakhar and the numbered companies claim they subsequently entered into an oral agreement with Raj and Amato in which they agreed to ""provide lobbying services"" to obtain the rezoning approvals, and their fees would be ""baked into"" the fees charged by Frontier Group.

Ford defends comment about Trump:   PC leader says he'll work 'with anyone' after he was caught on mic praising U.S. president's win,2025.0,"So much for Doug Ford's Trump card. Ford struggled Tuesday to explain why he wanted Donald Trump to win the U.S. presidential election after being caught on a hot mic in a gaffe that has jolted the Ontario campaign. It was an embarrassing setback for the Progressive Conservative leader, who has framed the snap Feb. 27 vote as a referendum on who could best deal with Trump's threatened 25 per cent tariffs against Canada. Complaining to reporters in Ottawa that ""you guys are obsessed with that,"" Ford was repeatedly pressed about the hot mic admission that he had hoped the Republican Trump would beat Democrat Kamala Harris last November. ""On election day, was I happy this guy won? One hundred per cent I was. Then the guy pulled out the knife and f--king yanked it in me,"" the Tory leader said Monday in Etobicoke, making a stabbing motion with his hand. The following day, Ford was forced to do damage control for his self-inflicted wound. ""Well, you know something, I always believe in working with anyone,"" he said in Ottawa, where he promised Queen's Park would upload OC Transpo's troubled LRT line. ""On the hot mic, yeah, he makes me swear. I think he makes a lot of people swear in this country,"" Ford acknowledged, insisting he believed the president would somehow be less provocative in his second term. Trump touted tariffs during the recent American campaign in which he also called the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol ""a day of love,"" even though the FBI dubbed it domestic terrorism that threatened the peaceful transfer of power. ""I thought it would be a little different, a little change, but obviously he decided to pull the knife out and stab us,"" Ford said on the shop floor of a door company. His main rivals pounced on his Monday comments made to Tory candidates Christine Hogarth and David Piccini and several members of the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association. Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie released a 60-second ad to highlight the PC leader's apparent hypocrisy by repeatedly playing the clip: ""Was I happy this guy won? One hundred per cent I was."" ""Doug Ford just said he was happy Donald Trump won the election. Happy the guy who campaigned on a trade war with Canada became president?"" intones a female narrator against footage of Trump boasting ""the tariff will be substantial in some cases"" and that he is ""a tariff man standing on a tariff platform."" ""He was happy? Was he happy Canadians might lose their jobs? Was he happy about the threat of Canada becoming a 51st state?"" continues the announcer. ""Or does he just care so little about the people of this province ... that he saw an attack on Ontario as an opportunity for himself. What else does he say when he thinks you're not listening?"" Speaking to the Star's Martin Regg Cohn at Toronto Metropolitan University's Democracy Forum, Crombie said Ford's support for Trump was revealing, given that Trump was his rationale for an ""unnecessary"" $189-million election 15 months before Ontario's next scheduled general election in June 2026. ""He used that as an excuse to call an election. He said basically said so himself ... in his hot mic moment,"" the Liberal leader told Cohn, predicting it could be a ""turning point."" ""I don't think it's a one-day wonder. There are always these moments in a campaign that are kind of pivot points ... that are revealing about a person's character,"" she said, noting Trump ""threatened our economy."" New Democrat Leader Marit Stiles said ""it doesn't surprise me at all"" that Ford would say he preferred Trump. ""It should make Ontarians question his judgment and his character,"" she told reporters at a campaign stop in Kingston. ""This is who Doug Ford is. He says one thing when he's out in front of the microphones ... and he says another one behind closed doors,"" Stiles said earlier Tuesday in Ottawa, where she highlighted her education plan that includes a universal school food program. ""It's a little bit sad, you know, that Doug Ford clearly is a big fan of Donald Trump, but Donald Trump doesn't seem to be aware of who Doug Ford is."" Public opinion research has suggested Canadians overwhelmingly preferred Harris over Trump last fall. Pollara Strategic Insights found 62 per cent of respondents had positive feelings about Harris with only 18 per cent having negative feelings toward the then-vice-president. The firm found 66 per cent had negative feelings about Trump with 20 per cent having positive feelings toward him.

Don't believe the PC leader's ploy,2025.0,"Premier Doug Ford is dragging Ontarians into a needless election in the dead of winter in pursuit of more power. The election call, more than a year ahead of time, is a cynical play for power, and on polling day, Feb. 27, Ontarians should rebuff him. Ford says he needs a ""strong mandate"" to deal with the threat posed by U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to impose punishing tariffs on Canada, but he doesn't need any such mandate. He already has it. In 2022, Ontarians handed him a huge majority, giving the Progressive Conservatives (PCs) 83 of the 124 seats in the legislature.

By any measure, that is as strong a mandate as any leader can get, and Ford has such control at Queen's Park, there is little he wants to do that he can't. Besides, every political leader in Ontario fully understands the dire consequences for the province and Canada if the Trump tariffs are implemented. There is therefore every expectation that all political leaders will come together to take the necessary steps to protect Ontario. Nothing so far suggests otherwise, and there is absolutely no reason to call a snap election to seek a new mandate. Ford is merely exploiting the threat of tariffs to scare Ontarians. We should resist. But since the election campaign is now fully engaged, we should oblige Ford by turning it into a referendum on his handling on the family-doctor crisis that has left 2.5 million people without primary care, a figure that could rise to more than four million by 2026. Think of the hundreds of people lining up in bitter cold in Walkerton recently, hoping to find a doctor. It is therefore not surprising that a day before the election call, Health Minister Sylvia Jones announced $1.4 billion in new funding over four years to connect two million people with a family doctor or primary-care team. Of course, the announcement is an election ploy. The crisis has been boiling since Ford was first elected in 2018. The problem has become worse not better under his watch, so just days before the election campaign gets underway, presto, Ford finds more than a billion to throw at the problem. Raise the issue in the campaign, and Ford will point to the money. But there are no guarantees things will actually change. The fact is, facing a weak opposition, ahead in the polls, and armed with a full war chest, Ford has been angling for this moment, and Donald Trump's tariff threats provided a convenient cover. Over the next month, you'll hear time and again that Ford needs to get a bigger majority so he'll be in a strong position to face Trump and save Ontario. ""I am asking the people for a strong mandate a strong, stable, fouryear mandate that will outlive and outlast the Trump administration,"" Ford wrote in a recent op-ed. ""President Trump needs to know that for as long as he is president, I will be on the other side of the table ready to protect Ontario."" Don't buy it. It's just talk. The tariff war, if it happens, will not be Ford's to lead. As Ontario premier, he will have significant input into whatever position the feds adopt.

Ford defends taking on dual roles; Ontario PC leader on the campaign trail while also fighting tariffs as premier; Ford defends taking on dual roles; Ontario PC leader on the campaign trail while also fighting tariffs as premier,2025.0,"Ontario Progressive Con- servative Leader Doug Ford is defending simultaneously wearing two hats, campaigning in a snap election he called and taking anti-tariff actions as premier. The other major political parties said Monday this is the worst time for Ontario to find itself in an election. U.S. President Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods had been set to take effect Tuesday, but were paused for at least 30 days. At an election announcement Monday, Ford bristled at a question suggesting he couldn't take all the necessary actions to protect Ontario in the middle of a campaign, noting that he had directed the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to take American products off shelves. Later Monday, after the announcement that the Trump tariffs had been paused, Ford announced that Ontario will pause all retaliatory measures against the U.S. ""We're going to do everything we can as we're standing here,"" he said earlier in the day. ""If any emergencies come, I'll reconvene cabinet. That's not an unusual request."" Ford has announced, as PC leader, that a re-elected Tory government would significantly expand the Skills Development Fund for training and employment programs as well as infrastructure spending, as part of a stimulus package. But after Ford confirmed as premier last week that cabinet had discussed an economic action plan to respond to tariffs, his staff noted the plan hadn't been approved by cabinet and therefore wouldn't be actually implemented during the campaign. Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said Ford is ""playing politics"" with tariffs and it's wrong. ""We shouldn't even be in an election right now because we should all be working together to have a united front against Trump,"" he said. ""Then for the premier to use essentially government announce- ments to advantage him in the campaign is not good for democracy."" NDP Leader Marit Stiles noted that the government should technically be in caretaker mode during a campaign. The Liberals wrote earlier to the secretary of cabinet, chief electoral officer and integrity commissioner, arguing that Ford planning to go ahead with a scheduled visit to Washington, D.C., this month with other premiers to advocate against tariffs is inappropriate during an election campaign. The integrity commissioner and secretary of cabinet said the trip meets the caretaker convention's criteria of being urgent and in the public interest, and the chief electoral officer said he would have to assess any expenses for appropriateness after the fact. Stiles was also talking tariffs Monday, saying if her party forms government she would implement a federal-provincial income support program, direct agencies to procure locally and create new supply chains for trade-exposed industries. However, Stiles' plan to protect Ontario from the effects of U.S. tariffs did not come with any dollar figures attached. When asked about costing, she said an NDP government would work in lockstep with the federal government to deliver the stimulus. Speaking in Oshawa, Stiles said Ford can't be trusted to protect workers because he ""gave up"" in 2018 when General Motors announced it would stop producing cars and trucks in the city east of Toronto. More production was ultimately secured, but Stiles said the people of Oshawa won't forget that in 2018 Ford said there was nothing the province could do to prevent the shutdown. Schreiner was in Kitchener to announce the Green party's housing plan that includes allowing fourplexes across the province, homes with six units in large cities, and mid-rise buildings of six to 11 storeys on transit corridors and main streets. He also pledged to remove development charges on homes under 2,000 square feet and remove the land transfer tax for first-time homebuyers.

Preparations begin for seismic work at Campbell River's Ladore Dam,2025.0,"Preparation work has begun for a seismic upgrade to the Ladore Dam to ensure it can withstand a major earthquake and that water keeps flowing. The Ladore Dam is one of three in the Campbell River hydroelectric system, along with John Hart and Strathcona dams, and all three are being upgraded. Work on the Ladore Dam is expected to cost $297 million to $379 million. Aecon EBC Ladore General Partnership is the con tractor on the project. By the time seismic work is completed on the three dams, the total cost could be $1.25 billion to $1.78 billion, a B.C. Hydro offi cial said. The Ladore Dam was built in 1949 and its powerhouse was completed in 1957. As part of the work, its three steel spillway gates will be replaced, with new equipment and upgrades to meet current reliability standards. Campbell River Mayor Kermit Dahl said in a statement that the project will not just improve seis mic safety across the Campbell River system, it will create about 70 jobs a year until it's completed in 2029. He noted that the Island is in the most seismically active zone in B.C. B.C. Hydro said it has had consultations with First Nations, government agencies, residents and others during project plan ning. Chief executive Chris O'Riley said B.C. Hydro has been assess ing earthquake hazards at its dams and related facilities and upgrading them as required ""for many decades."" The Ladore project will improve the reliability of the spillway gate system, along with its power supply, control and tele scommunications, O'Riley said. B.C. Hydro is temporar ily closing the road across the Strathcona Dam on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Feb. 7 to March 7 to allow for construc tion work for the Strathcona Dam water discharge upgrade project. The road will also be closed on Saturday, Feb. 15.

Wilkinson holds out hope for his party; Liberal believes Carney would be better negotiator with Trump than Poilievre,2025.0,"There's nothing quite like a leadership race to inject hope into a floundering political party. One gets it. Sometimes, you just need a little hope ... whether it's grounded in reality or not. And few had a greater sense of hopelessness than the federal Liberals, who were in utter chaos even before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his pending resignation. However, hope springs eternal ... or so seems the case for the closest thing Saskatchewan has to an elected federal government representative - Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who was raised in Saskatchewan and was once employed in the provincial justice ministry's constitutional branch under the Roy Romanow NDP government. Wilkinson now claims Liberal hopes are soaring beyond vague aspirations of preventing Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives from absolutely crushing them in the upcoming federal election. ""If you had asked me that a couple months ago, I would have said, in our heart of hearts, that's probably what we were aiming to do - try and hold Poilievre to a minority,"" Wilkinson said in an interview this week after announcing in Saskatoon $41 million in federal government spending to support the first carbon-neutral copper mine in Canada. ""But today I actually think we can win. I think we will. And I think the polls will actually show that."" Wilkinson noted a recent EKOS poll showing the Liberals have moved to within seven points of the Conservatives, but said he was as heartened by a political event in Saskatoon on Monday night while stumping for presumed leadership front-runner Mark Carney. A Liberal event that would normally have trouble attracting flies drew 120 people. Similarly, he says his own North Vancouver riding membership has quadrupled to between 1,200 and 1,300 for this leadership race in which every constituency in the country is allotted 100 points, regardless of its membership numbers. ""Even if you are in Brampton where there are 5,000 members versus Yorkton-Melville that may get 100 (members) you get the same number of points,"" Wilkinson said. ""So there are a lot of leadership candidates who are very focused on Saskatchewan ridings."" What's re-engaging Liberals - and perhaps other Canadi - ans, as well - is the havoc U.S. President Donald Trump is creating, Wilkinson argued. ""I think Canadians are increasingly offended by some of the things being said in the United States, including 'becoming the 51st state' garbage,"" the federal minister said. According to Wilkinson, the clear answer for the Liberals and the country is Carney; the two men met 25 years ago while in business and seeking investments for clean technology. ""Mark Carney is actually the deepest thinker in this country on finance and economic issues,"" Wilkinson said. ""That's reflected in not only his experience with the Bank of Canada but also with the Bank of England ... ""But he's also someone who has, throughout his career, evidenced a strong concern about the climate issue. I think that marriage is exactly what Canadians are looking for."" Wilkinson scoffed at the criticism that Carney is a repackaged version of what Canadians have got from Liberals for 10 years, arguing it's the Conservatives offering career politicians like Poilievre, who ""has never had another job since being elected to the House of Commons as a 25-year-old."" ""That was the same with (former Conservative leader) Andrew Scheer,"" Wilkinson said. ""The comparison is stark.

"Public service cuts are easier said than done; Poilievre must offer more clarity on his intentions, writes Andrew MacDougall",2025.0,"If Pierre Poilievre has any big plans to butcher the federal public service if he becomes prime minister, he will need to be careful in how he approaches his cuts. For while there is ample fat to trim in the bureaucracy, the public service is like an expensive slab of wagyu, not a cheaper striploin. Like the expensive Japanese beef, federal departments are marbled with fat. Rare is the case when an entire departmental branch can be excised like the fat along the edge of the striploin. It's more likely each branch has dead weight and artifacts of defunct programs scattered throughout, making the trimming of waste a labour-intensive exercise. And just like the turkey that doesn't vote for Christmas, no bureaucracy welcomes reform, especially when that reform means shrinkage. Should they form government, the Conservatives will have to expend a lot of political energy on public-service reform. This kind of knowledge and institutional memory would be at a premium in the new government, given how few one-time ministers remain from the Stephen Harper era. Managing a vast federal department is hard when you know the ropes; it is virtually impossible when you don't. The asymmetry of knowledge between politician and senior mandarin is never larger than on Day 1 of any new mandate. What's more, the bureaucracy is a master of offering up painful choices on cuts and portraying them as the only option. If Department X is asked for Y millions in cuts, you can be sure that Y will be found from the most essential service the department provides. I can recall the Ottawa-based RCMP Musical Ride being offered up as a cut when the Harper majority government began looking for savings in the wake of the global financial crisis. Thankfully for Poilievre, Justin Trudeau is starting the process on his way out. Recent changes to immigration programs made by the current Liberal government mean the job cuts are already here. Places like Ottawa won't like it that more than 3,000 positions will be cut at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, but those cuts are a sign of what's to come. And while the usual suspects - in this case, the Canadian Employment and Immigration Union - will complain, a strong mandate from the Canadian people would help a Poilievre government overcome any stakeholder opposition. There is always a reason why not to cut - i.e. potential border chaos if Donald Trump follows through on his rhetoric - but ifs, buts and maybes can be dealt with should they arise. It is good that the Conservative leader is beginning to put down markers on the work of the public service and how it would be delivered under his watch. A new prime minister doesn't need to pick fights with the people who actually deliver his promises. Poilievre isn't being dogmatic about coming to the office five days a week as long, he says, as the work is done. And if that hybrid structure requires a bit of monitoring to enforce, then so be it. Ultimately, Poilievre must offer more specificity on his plans. We know the CBC English service is for the chopping block. If he has more wholesale chops up his sleeve, the time to communicate them is now. The rest can probably wait, especially if the plan is to actually pick through the wagyu fat in the public service.

Poilievre's cuts to public service won't be easy,2025.0,"If Pierre Poilievre has any big plans to butcher the federal public service, he will need to be careful in how he approaches his cuts. For while there is ample fat to trim in the bureaucracy, the public service is like an expensive slab of Wagyu, not a cheaper striploin. Like the expensive Japanese beef, federal departments are marbled with fat. Rare is the case when an entire departmental branch can be excised like the fat along the edge of the striploin. It's more likely each branch has dead weight and artifacts of defunct programs scattered throughout, making the trimming of waste a labour-intensive exercise. And just like the turkey that doesn't vote for Christmas, no bureaucracy welcomes reform, especially when that reform means shrinkage. Should they form government, the Conservatives will have to expend a lot of political energy on public-service reform. This kind of knowledge and institutional memory will be at a premium in the new government, given how few one-time ministers remain from the Stephen Harper era. Managing a vast federal department is hard when you know the ropes; it is virtually impossible when you don't. The asymmetry of knowledge between politician and senior mandarin is never larger than on Day 1 of any new mandate. What's more, the bureaucracy is a master of offering up painful choices on cuts and portraying them as the only option. If Department X is asked for Y millions in cuts, you can be sure that Y will be found from the most essential service the department provides. I can recall the Ottawa-based RCMP Musical Ride being offered up as a cut when the Harper majority government began looking for savings in the wake of the global financial crisis. Thankfully for Poilievre, Justin Trudeau is starting the process on his way out. Recent changes to immigration programs made by the current Liberal government mean the job cuts are already here. Places like Ottawa won't like it that more than 3,000 positions will be cut at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, but those cuts are a sign of what's to come. And while the usual suspects - in this case, the Canadian Employment and Immigration Union - will complain, a strong mandate from the Canadian people should help a Poilievre government overcome any stakeholder opposition. There is always a reason why not to cut - i.e. potential border chaos if Donald Trump follows through on his rhetoric - but ifs, buts and maybes can be dealt with should they arise. What Poilievre will have to offer up in return is clarity and leadership by example. It is good that the Conservative leader is beginning to put down markers on the work of the public service and how it is to be delivered. A new prime minister doesn't need to pick any fights with the people who will actually deliver his promises. Poilievre isn't being dogmatic about coming to the office five days a week as long, he says, as the work is done. And if that hybrid structure requires a bit of monitoring to enforce, then so be it. A ban on social media use by public servants outside of the communications functions would be a boon for office productivity. Ultimately, Poilievre will need to offer more specificity on his plans. We know the CBC English service is for the chopping block. If Poilievre has more wholesale chops up his sleeve, the time to communicate them is now. The rest can probably wait, especially if the plan is to actually pick through the Wagyu fat in the public service. What the Conservatives could also do is lead by example with their ministerial offices. Part of the reason the public service got so big under Trudeau is because it took its cues from the man at the top.

Poilievre's plan as anti-Israel rallies go on,2025.0,"As radical anti-Israel rallies continue to be a feature of Canadian downtowns even in the wake of a Gazan ceasefire, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre proposed on Monday to deport non-citizens participating in hate activities. ""We see on our own streets antisemitism guided by obscene woke ideologies that have led to an explosion in hate crimes,"" Poilievre said in a brief address at the official Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony in Ottawa. He then added, ""we must not just condemn these things, we must take action."" ""We must deport from our country any temporary resident that is here on a permit or a visa that is carrying out violence or hate crimes on our soil."" Ever since the October 7 Hamas-led terrorist attacks against Israel, Canada has been hit by hundreds of anti-Israel rallies, blockades and other actions - many of them organized by a handful of openly anti-Zionist groups including Toronto4Palestine, the Palestinian Youth Movement and student groups such as McGill University's Students for Palestine's Honour and Resistance. Some of the rallies were initially celebratory, but they quickly shifted to calls for ""ceasefire,"" often with the claim that Israel was committing genocide. Now that a Gazan ceasefire has been in place since Jan. 19, rallies have continued unabated, often with calls for Palestinian ""resistance"" to continue until Israel's complete destruction. ""The fight isn't over. In fact, it has just begun,"" Toronto4Palestine said in a statement released after the ceasefire announcement. In a social media post on Monday, Poilievre said Canada was ""in a dark time of rampant antisemitism."" A Monday statement issued by the Conservative party also pledged ""to restore a Canada where Jews are able to live fearlessly and unapologetically Jewish lives."" On Saturday, Torontobased lawyer and protest watcher Caryma Sa'd posted video of one of her videographers being spit on by a woman in a keffiyeh and declaring, ""F-king Zionist little pig."" ""He has never taken any public position on Israel or Jewish nationalism, and this woman is a stranger,"" Sa'd wrote in a caption. The alleged assault occurred outside the context of an anti-Israel rally. But on Tuesday, Toronto4Palestine advertised a ""Ceasefire Today, Liberation Tomorrow"" event in Mississauga, Ont., where attendees were invited to ""strategize for the future of our liberation struggle in the far diaspora."" In the final hours of a ceasefire deal being finalized, on Jan. 16 Toronto4Palestine also organized a ""Gaza Will Rise"" event outside Toronto's Israeli consulate, which the group refers to as the ""Zionist consulate."" Attendees were urged to ""drive the struggle for liberation forward."" The Montreal chapter of Palestinian Youth Movement marked the ceasefire with a ""victory"" rally through the city's downtown behind a banner reading ""Ceasefire Today. Liberation Tomorrow."" Video from a Montreal rally posted by the X account FactsMatter showed jubilant crowds blocking intersections, chanting in Arabic and lighting off smoke bombs, all under the gaze of police observers on bicycles. ""The bloodthirsty Zionists will stop at nothing to continue their evil and oppression,"" reads an official Facebook post by Montreal4Palestine promoting a rally titled ""From Gaza to Jenin, Liberate All of Palestine"" that was held Sunday. The event name is a call for Israel's annihilation.

Young Liberals have a plan to win youth vote; Poilievre leads polls among those 18 to 34,2025.0,"The president of the Liberal Party of Canada's youth wing says he believes it remains the party of youth, even as many appear to have left, flocking instead to the party's chief rival: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Liam Olsen, who has led the Young Liberals of Canada since 2023, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed he took young people and their issues seriously, from appointing himself to be the minister of youth and establishing youth councils, to prioritize fighting climate change and ending interest on federal student loans. Now, Olsen says, it is time the party considers what's next. ""We need to build a nation for our generation,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Too many young people feel like we're being left behind, like no matter how hard we're working, or how hard we're studying, that we can't get out of debt, but that's because of student debt we accumulated through university or college. We can't keep up with rent or rising grocery prices, and we need leaders who hear our voices."" With the contest to replace Trudeau underway, the Young Liberals are calling on candidates to commit to championing a new policy pledge. Released on Thursday, the one-page document highlights different priorities it wants them to advance. They include lowering the voting age to 16, restricting temporary foreign work in regions where young people don't have jobs, ensuring youth have ""debt-free"" access to post-secondary and halving green house gas emissions by 2035. Topping the list of priorities is one that reads: ""the housing affordability crisis is a national emergency."" Olsen said candidates ought to talk about it as such. Poilievre has made housing affordability a central plank of his pitch for why Canadians should elect him as their next prime minister, targeting those under 40, for whom owning a home feels impossible. While Liberals, New Democrats and others dismiss Poilievre's efforts as nothing more than social media sound bites and slogans, months of back-toback polling suggests his message has worked. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator, 338Canada, says Conservative are leading among those aged 18 to 34, with the Liberals and NDP battling it out for a distant second. Not only is that significant because of how Trudeau rose to power in 2015 by appealing directly to young people, but because young Canadians have traditionally veered towards the NDP. Fournier says the Conservatives began rising in the polls around when housing prices were being hit hard by interest rate hikes coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Poilievre began pounding the message that people cannot afford homes under Trudeau and Conservatives would fix things. ""That I think resonated with a lot of young voters,"" Fournier says. Since becoming Conservative leader in 2022, Poilievre has ushered in a social media savvy not seen from previous Conservative leaders, which has driven his success among younger Canadians. In his mostrecent wide-ranging interview with right-wing commentator and host Jordan Peterson, Poilievre discussed how many of the young people he meets are ""exhausted."" He at one point says that all young people do now ""is work."" ""I am astonished when I meet university students how much they work outside of their studies just to scrape by,"" Poilievre told Peterson. ""These kids are working 20-30 hours a week in addition to a full course load."" Whether those trying to replace Trudeau can claw back any of that support remains an open question. The winner will likely have little time to do so, given how they may find themselves campaigning in a general election in only weeks. Pointing to a newly released poll suggesting the Liberals may be experiencing a bump since U.S. President Donald Trump's election, Olsen expressed optimism. He added he is not ""focused on the past"" and that life has become more expensive for everyone. ""I don't think it's just young people."" Fournier says it is still to early to tell whether Canadians feel differently about the Liberals following Trudeau's decision to resign. Olsen said he believes all leadership candidates take youth issues seriously, having spoken with the campaigns of front-runners Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor, as well as former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Olsen also said he has been in touch with Karina Gould's campaign, the only one of the three making a direct appeal to the party's young Liberals. On Thursday, both Gould and Freeland announced that as part of their plans to renew the party they would reinstate the role of paid national director of the young Liberals group. In her proposal, Gould, who is herself a millennial said they need the support of young Canadians if they hope to win the next election. At her campaign launch last weekend, the 37-year-old talked about having been a Liberal since she was a teen and celebrated the youth wing has having been the first to champion matters that later became government policy, like Indigenous reconciliation. She also recently held an event with around 40 young Liberals. ""Young people are looking for a leader who will listen and represent their voices. I'm ready to bring that change,"" she posted to X.

Young Liberals have a plan to win youth vote; Poilievre leads polls among those 18 to 34,2025.0,"The president of the Liberal Party of Canada's youth wing says he believes it remains the party of youth, even as many appear to have left, flocking instead to the party's chief rival: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Liam Olsen, who has led the Young Liberals of Canada since 2023, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed he took young people and their issues seriously, from appointing himself to be the minister of youth and establishing youth councils, to prioritize fighting climate change and ending interest on federal student loans. Now, Olsen says, it is time the party considers what's next. ""We need to build a nation for our generation,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Too many young people feel like we're being left behind, like no matter how hard we're working, or how hard we're studying, that we can't get out of debt, but that's because of student debt we accumulated through university or college.

With the contest to replace Trudeau underway, the Young Liberals are calling on candidates to commit to championing a new policy pledge. Released on Thursday, the one-page document highlights different priorities it wants them to advance. They include lowering the voting age to 16, restricting temporary foreign work in regions where young people don't have jobs, ensuring youth have ""debt-free"" access to post-secondary and halving green house gas emissions by 2035. Topping the list of priorities is one that reads: ""the housing affordability crisis is a national emergency."" Olsen said candidates ought to talk about it as such. Poilievre has made housing affordability a central plank of his pitch for why Canadians should elect him as their next prime minister, targeting those under 40, for whom owning a home feels impossible. While Liberals, New Democrats and others dismiss Poilievre's efforts as nothing more than social media sound bites and slogans, months of back-toback polling suggests his message has worked. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator, 338Canada, says Conservative are leading among those aged 18 to 34, with the Liberals and NDP battling it out for a distant second. Not only is that significant because of how Trudeau rose to power in 2015 by appealing directly to young people, but because young Canadians have traditionally veered towards the NDP. Fournier says the Conservatives began rising in the polls around when housing prices were being hit hard by interest rate hikes coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Poilievre began pounding the message that people cannot afford homes under Trudeau and Conservatives would fix things. ""That I think resonated with a lot of young voters,"" Fournier says. Since becoming Conservative leader in 2022, Poilievre has ushered in a social media savvy not seen from previous Conservative leaders, which has driven his success among younger Canadians. In his mostrecent wide-ranging interview with right-wing commentator and host Jordan Peterson, Poilievre discussed how many of the young people he meets are ""exhausted."" He at one point says that all young people do now ""is work."" ""I am astonished when I meet university students how much they work outside of their studies just to scrape by,"" Poilievre told Peterson. ""These kids are working 20-30 hours a week in addition to a full course load."" Whether those trying to replace Trudeau can claw back any of that support remains an open question.

Liberals start to creep up on conservatives: Survey; New poll that shows Grit support rising should be enough to give Poilievre pause,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives have been spooked in recent days by signs of a Liberal revival under a new leader. They didn't seem too worried until Mark Carney, the Bank of Canada candidate, came across as a regular human on a U.S. comedy show. Now, a poll from the Angus Reid Institute shows the Liberals gaining ground. They have climbed well out of their new year's nightmare, the 16 per cent support just before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he'd quit. Angus Reid polled two scenarios, asking people which party they'd support with either Carney or ex-finance minister Chrystia Freeland as Liberal leader. Carney runs slightly ahead of Freeland. Both are still well behind the Conservatives, but the lift in Liberal backing is enough to give Poilievre pause. The Liberals under Carney would get 29 per cent national support. Freeland Liberals would clock 24 per cent. Not great, but a big jump from 16 per cent. Nonetheless, the Conservatives are still in majority territory. They would win 43 per cent running against Carney, and 44 per cent if Freeland were the temporary prime minister. One intriguing finding is the NDP would score four points higher with Liberal leader Freeland (17 per cent) than Carney (13 per cent). With Carney in charge of the Liberals, the Conservatives would win 46 per cent in B.C.; 65 in Alberta; 53 in Saskatchewan and Manitoba; 50 per cent in Ontario; 18 per cent in Quebec, and 37 per cent in Atlantic Canada. The Liberals are the usual hot mess anywhere from the Rockies to Manitoba's eastern border. ""While both potential leaders struggle to generate much support in the Prairies, a potential Freeland-led Liberal party performs worse than the NDP in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba,"" the pollster says. But, suddenly, all-important Ontario shows some serious Liberal gains. The Liberals have 34 per cent with Carney as leader. Substitute Freeland, and the backing drops to 27 per cent. The relatively weaker Ontario standing for Freeland could well cost her the leadership, as party loyalists seek the leader most likely to pull off a miracle. Those miracles only happen in Ontario. With both Liberal leaders, Conservative backing in Ontario is virtually identical at near 50 per cent. The Liberals lead only in Atlantic Canada. They have 42 per cent compared to 37 for the Conservatives. Support is identical for both Carney and Freeland-led Liberals. Quebec appears to be a lost cause for the Liberals, who have 23 per cent support with Freeland and 25 with Carney. The Bloc Quebecois reigns. Carney is ahead of Freeland by a couple of points, but Bloc support also rises sharply if he's in charge. The pollster asked Carney and Freeland supporters about their key issues: ""The economy in general is narrowly chosen more often by Carney Liberals, while climate change is a slightly higher priority among Freeland Liberals."" This suggests voters aren't yet aware that Carney is one of the world's most influential advocates of pressing climate action through government fiscal policy. The Reid poll sums up: ""The former Bank of Canada Governor Carney appears to have an advantage among prospective voters over his main rival. ... That said, both still have to contend with Liberal party members and make their case to be the next leader, and both still trail the opposition Conservative party by a double-digit margin."" This early polling doesn't account for the looming crisis with the U.S. A trade war could yet be the factor that revives the Liberals, or flattens them for a generation.

"Recall Parliament; Listen to Poilievre, and let MPs get back to work now, says Terry Glavin",2025.0,"However you interpret the American president's threats to cripple the Canadian economy for whichever of the illogical reasons he cites, and whatever anyone makes of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, he's dead right about this: Canada needs to quickly develop a plan for retaliatory tariffs, and that means Parliament has to be immediately reconvened. Unless and until that happens, all we have is a kind of extraparliamentary provisional government in the form of the Council of the Federation, which consists of 13 premiers of Canada's 10 provinces and the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Or rather 12 premiers, now that Alberta's Danielle Smith has struck out on her own to engage in freelance diplomacy on behalf of Alberta's oil companies. In any case, put them all together and they still have no constitutional authority to negotiate with a foreign power, which is Ottawa's business, and the council carries a national mandate every bit as tenuous as the hold Justin Trudeau maintains over the paralyzed federal government. As things stand, the House of Commons will remain effectively under lock and key until Justin Trudeau is replaced by his own party in a leadership race, Parliament is recalled and a failed confidence motion triggers a federal election. This rigmarole was precipitated by a prime minister whose own party and caucus wanted him gone even before Donald Trump decided to rampage onto the scene. It could end up prolonging Canada's democratic interregnum until early May. Faced with a rupture in Canada-U.S. relations that could cost 1.5 million Canadian jobs, a massive economic contraction and supply chain mayhem, just for starters, recalling the House just to formally and officially defeat the minority Liberals in a confidence vote would be wholly insufficient in light of the crisis Canada is facing. For one thing, the $1.3-billion border-armouring plan Ottawa announced last week, which will merely address one of the concocted pretexts President Trump has cited for his belligerence, is technically unfunded because there's no sitting Parliament to authorize the expenditure. ""We also need retaliatory tariffs, something that requires urgent Parliamentary consideration,"" Poilievre said Tuesday. This stands in stark contrast to the clever talk in certain Conservative circles that we shouldn't be talking about tariffs at all, that we should be trying to persuade the Americans how helpful we can be in their delusions of grandeur and Trump can be appeased if we just slobber on his slippers and bend to his will. By all means, yes, the Americans should be made to understand how good a deal they're getting out of our $700-billion annual trading relationship, and yes, Canadian diplomats should make the case to American lawmakers that Trump's claims about Canada enjoying a $200-billion annual ""subsidy"" in the relationship is a jumble of falsehoods and illiteracy, but if it's a North American fortress they want we can help them build that, too, whatever it's supposed to mean. But all that is for Canadians to decide, through their own Parliament. And at the moment, we don't have one. ""Canada has never been so weak,"" Poilievre said, ""and things have never been so out of control. Liberals are putting themselves and their leadership politics ahead of the country."" That's a hard argument to beat. On Jan. 6, Gov.-Gen. Mary Simon granted Trudeau his request to prorogue Parliament to allow the Liberals time to pick his successor - a move which may have been unconstitutional. On Jan. 7, Trump said he intended to apply ""economic force"" to carry out his intention of absorbing Canada as the 51st American state. Last week, ruling on an application filed by the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, the Federal Court of Canada's Chief Justice Paul S. Crampton granted an expedited hearing on an ""urgent"" basis to consider the legality of the governor general's decision. In light of Trump's threats, Judge Crampton ruled against the Liberal government's lawyers: ""The fact remains that there would be no opportunity for Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions, including by availing itself of legislative tools at its disposal, for a significant period during which Canada will likely face a grave challenge."" Quite apart from the sloppy constitutional hygiene involved, to prorogue Parliament at a moment like this, and for the reasons Trudeau offered, was contemptuous of Canadian democracy. ""Open Parliament. Take back control,"" Poilievre said Tuesday. ""Put Canada First."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford seems to be ready to do just that. Wanting what he's called a ""clear mandate"" to ask for what could be painful sacrifices from Ontarians in the adoption of retaliatory actions against U.S. business interests, the Ontario Conservative leadership has alerted the party that a provincial election is likely imminent. ""I'm going to use every tool in the tool box to protect the people of Ontario,"" Ford said. ""We need a clear mandate, not for tomorrow, not for the next day, for four years of dealing with our American friends."" So does the federal government. Trump did not follow through with his pledge to sign an executive order immediately after his inauguration on Monday to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. Instead, after affixing his signature to dozens of executive orders, Trump told reporters the 25 per cent tariffs will be in place Feb. 1, because Canada, like Mexico, is ""allowing vast numbers of people ... and fentanyl to come in."" Canada is not allowing vast numbers of people or significant amounts of fentanyl to enter the United States, especially when compared with Mexico. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials say 19.5 kilograms of fentanyl was seized at Canadian border points last year, compared to 9,570 kilograms seized on the U.S. Mexico border. U.S. officials recorded more than two million ""encounters"" on the Mexico border last year, about 10 times the number of encounters on the Canada-U.S. border, and ""encounters"" can mean all sorts of situations. Whatever the Feb. 1 deadline turns out to mean, Trump has given his officials until April 1 to prepare a report on migrants and fentanyl from Mexico, Canada and China. So there's time to talk sense to American lawmakers, and as chair of the Council of the Federation, Ontario's Ford will be leading a delegation to Washington, D.C. on Feb. 12 ""to advocate for maintaining strong Canada-U.S. relations."" On the agenda: employment, the economy, energy, critical mineral supply chains, border security and immigration. While American law grants the president tremendous leeway in foreign trade and in the executive application of tariffs, Congress can restrain the president if it wants to, and there are midterm elections two years down the road. The Republicans enjoy a small majority in the Senate, 53-47, and in the House their edge is paper thin: 218-215. So there's hope that if Trump means war, and Canada retaliates with tariffs or export restrictions that make key states and districts sting, we might be able to fight this thing. But we need a plan. Ottawa needs a mandate. And for that we need a Parliament, and we need it now.

Poilievre's cuts to public service won't be easy,2025.0,"If Pierre Poilievre has any big plans to butcher the federal public service, he will need to be careful in how he approaches his cuts. For while there is ample fat to trim in the bureaucracy, the public service is like an expensive slab of Wagyu, not a cheaper striploin. Like the expensive Japanese beef, federal departments are marbled with fat. Rare is the case when an entire departmental branch can be excised like the fat along the edge of the striploin. It's more likely each branch has dead weight and artifacts of defunct programs scattered throughout, making the trimming of waste a labour-intensive exercise. And just like the turkey that doesn't vote for Christmas, no bureaucracy welcomes reform, especially when that reform means shrinkage. Should they form government, the Conservatives will have to expend a lot of political energy on public-service reform. This kind of knowledge and institutional memory will be at a premium in the new government, given how few one-time ministers remain from the Stephen Harper era. Managing a vast federal department is hard when you know the ropes; it is virtually impossible when you don't. The asymmetry of knowledge between politician and senior mandarin is never larger than on Day 1 of any new mandate. What's more, the bureaucracy is a master of offering up painful choices on cuts and portraying them as the only option. If Department X is asked for Y millions in cuts, you can be sure that Y will be found from the most essential service the department provides. I can recall the Ottawa-based RCMP Musical Ride being offered up as a cut when the Harper majority government began looking for savings in the wake of the global financial crisis. Thankfully for Poilievre, Justin Trudeau is starting the process on his way out. Recent changes to immigration programs made by the current Liberal government mean the job cuts are already here. Places like Ottawa won't like it that more than 3,000 positions will be cut at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, but those cuts are a sign of what's to come. And while the usual suspects - in this case, the Canadian Employment and Immigration Union - will complain, a strong mandate from the Canadian people should help a Poilievre government overcome any stakeholder opposition. There is always a reason why not to cut - i.e. potential border chaos if Donald Trump follows through on his rhetoric - but ifs, buts and maybes can be dealt with should they arise. What Poilievre will have to offer up in return in clarity and leadership by example. It is good that the Conservative leader is beginning to put down markers on the work of the public service and how it is to be delivered. A new prime minister doesn't need to pick any fights with the people who will actually deliver his promises. Poilievre isn't being dogmatic about coming to the office five days a week as long, he says, as the work is done. And if that hybrid structure requires a bit of monitoring to enforce, then so be it. A ban on social media use by public servants outside of the communications functions would be a boon for office productivity. Ultimately, Poilievre will need to offer more specificity on his plans. We know the CBC English service is for the chopping block. If Poilievre has more wholesale chops up his sleeve, the time to communicate them is now. The rest can probably wait, especially if the plan is to actually pick through the Wagyu fat in the public service. What the Conservatives could also do is lead by example with their ministerial offices. Part of the reason the public service got so big under Trudeau is because it took its cues from the man at the top. A prime minister dragging his RCMP detail to the Bahamas can't raise an objection to a bureaucracy asking for a little more here and a little more there. If Poilievre wants lean, he can begin by choosing the leanest cuts for his PMO.

Khan says Sun shining a bad light on him:   PC leadership hopeful points to instances of bias by paper partly owned by rival Daudrich,2025.0,"Progressive Conservative leadership hopeful Obby Khan has refused to take part in a debate organized by the Winnipeg Sun , stating that since part-owner Wally Daudrich declared his candidacy, the publication has gone after him with “misinformed attacks under the guise of editorial commentary.” Khan wrote an email to followers that said Daudrich and Sun publisher Kevin Klein must address their conflict of interest. He said he was “astonished” to receive an invitation from “the Daudrich-Klein Sun group,” which refers to the candidate, and former PC cabinet minister Klein, who led the group that bought the newspaper after he lost his seat in the 2023 provincial election. “We have declined this invitation to what we believe will be a biased, non-PC party-sanctioned debate,” said Khan, the member for Fort Whyte since a byelection in 2022. He said he’s keen to debate Daudrich, but not if the Sun moderates it. In an interview Friday, Khan pointed to stories and opinion pieces in the Sun that he said are biased and lack transparency because they fail to disclose that Daudrich is a director of the company, in addition to being a shareholder. In response, Daudrich’s campaign spokesman Mike Patton said the candidate’s association with the newspaper shouldn’t surprise anyone who has been following the campaign closely. “Wally has certainly been very public about it and by no means tried to keep it a secret,” he said in an email. He deferred to the Sun for comment on any alleged bias. Klein did not respond to a request for comment Friday but forwarded a link to a story in his paper that day about tensions in the leadership race. Khan listed several examples he said show the newspaper has picked sides. “I’ve only been reached out to once for comment,” he said. When he provided a comment by the deadline provided, it wasn’t included in the published story until it was updated at a later date, Khan said. The paper ran a photo of Khan — the first Muslim elected to the legislature — holding the Qur’an, and reported that he approves of pro-Palestinian activist Ramsey Zeid’s behaviour, by not condemning his social media posts. Khan said the Sun article reported incorrectly that Zeid donated $5,000 to his leadership campaign and implied that the donation was made close to Oct. 7 — the one-year anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks on Israel. Khan said it was “utterly disgusting” misinformation. He said Zeid donated $1,100 to his campaign well before Oct. 7.“It is appalling that that connection is made there.” When the Sun reported Thursday that Khan refused to participate in its debate, it again ran a photo of him with Zeid “for no apparent reason,” he said. Khan said the newspaper has run old photos of him with the former head of the Yazidi Association of Manitoba, who has since been charged with sexual assault. “There’s articles written in the Winnipeg Sun that have nothing to do with me and yet there’s a picture of myself,” he said. Until it posted a story Friday, the Sun was the only mainstream media outlet that didn’t report on the controversy over an Islamaphobic comment posted on Daudrich’s Facebook campaign page, as well as the demand for an apology from 17 Manitoba organizations, Khan said. “If that doesn’t paint a very clear, decisive bias by the Daudrich-Klein Sun group, I don’t know what does.” The groups called on the PC party to review Daudrich’s candidacy after they say he has refused to apologize for sharing an Islamophobic post on social media. Daudrich’s campaign reposted a message from a supporter in early January that ended with, “We must stop Muslim Obby Khan from becoming the Conservative leader.” At the time, Daudrich’s campaign manager said the sharing of the post was “an honest mistake” by their team. The post was removed. A letter shared by the National Council of Canadian Muslims on Thursday signed by the 17 organizations — including Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian and Mennonite groups — urges Daudrich to apologize and “state an actionable commitment toward combating anti-Muslim sentiment within Manitoba.” The letter says Daudrich’s response is unsatisfactory. “Mr. Daudrich denies any wrongdoing, deflects responsibility to his campaign staff and team, and disrespectfully criticizes community members who raise concerns — these actions are not befitting a leadership candidate in a provincial party,” the letter states. The letter was published “but never shared directly with us,” said Patton. “We have already dealt with this matter and have nothing further to add,” he said. When asked about the post <a href=""https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/faith/2025/01/15/concerns-raised-over-comments-referencing-muslims-reposted-by-tory-leadership-hopeful"" target=""_blank"">earlier this month</a>, Khan said an apology and a condemnation of “that type of language” was necessary.

"Re: 'Poilievre can't be trusted to negotiate with Trump: Sudbury MP,' Jan. 15",2025.0,"The hallmarks of a good person are honesty and credibility. Sadly, blatant and willful misinformation by Viviane Lapointe, Sudbury Liberal MP, do not measure up to the criteria; this from one who would love to bend at the trough again for four more years and thereby qualify for her government pension. She is putting out the typical self-serving Liberal fear-mongering that we have all come to expect come election time. Some of us remember the 2006 general election where the Liberal fear-mongering mantra of Paul Martin was: beware the PC's frightening ""hidden agenda."" Folks, don't believe one single word Viviane Laponte says. She now stands in third place behind the PCs and NDP in the Sudbury riding. Desperate people say desperate things. Viviane should ask the Honourable Jody Wilson-Raybould, (former minister of Justice and Attorney General for Canada), and minister of Health Dr. Jane Philpott if they trust the Liberal Party of Canada after Trudeau threw them both under the bus and removed them from caucus for having the temerity to express their opinions and disagree with him. Furthermore, I have company in my assessment of Lapointe's comments: an informal poll carried out by The Sudbury Star shows that 65 per cent of those who read the MP's column do not agree with her.","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.","Ray, Vincent",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 23, 2025",,,2025-01-23,Sudbury Star

Ex-envoys push for Poilievre to connect with White House; Unusually Chilly,2025.0,"As the Trump administration continues to muse about slapping ruinous tariffs on Canadian exports, it's put Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in the awkward situation of reacting to a U.S. government that would very clearly prefer him as Canadian leader. U.S. President Donald Trump is not known to have ever uttered the name ""Pierre Poilievre"" in public, but he is surrounded by cabinet members and allies who have openly expressed their desire to oust Canada's incumbent Liberal government in favour of one led by Poilievre. ""This guy is going to send Trudeau packing in 2025 (finally) and start digging Canada out of the progressive mess it's in,"" Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, wrote in a May social media post referring to Poilievre. Billionaire Elon Musk - the head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency - has openly endorsed Poilievre and repeatedly praised the Conservative leader on X.com, the social media platform that Musk owns. Against all this, Poilievre has been promising to retaliate in any trade war started by Trump, and has begun using the slogan ""Canada First"" as an apparent counterweight to Trump's motto of ""America First."" ""Canada will never be the 51st state. Period. We are a great and independent country,"" wrote Poilievre in one of the most widely circulated responses to Trump's repeated suggestion that Canada be annexed as a U.S. state. The Tory leader has also been conspicuously avoiding any public contact with U.S. leadership. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for a Canadian opposition leader to have at least some communication with a U.S. administration. As Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney prepared to take the reins from Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the early 1980s, he made multiple contacts with the Reagan White House, and even travelled to Washington, D.C. But Poilievre did not join the stream of Canadian political leaders visiting Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and has seemed to scoff at the suggestion. At a November press conference, Poilievre was asked if we would be prepared to go to Mar-a-Lago if invited. ""I have not been invited to that so thank you very much,"" he replied before walking away. Upon Trump's Nov. 5 election win, Poilievre issued a rote statement promising to ""work with the President to benefit both countries"" - before alleging that the U.S. has been a prime beneficiary of capital flight from Canada. ""The U.S. has already taken half a trillion dollars of investment and jobs from Canada under 9 years of Trudeau,"" he wrote. Former diplomats have even opined that Poilievre is being unusually chilly with the Trump White House. Deanna Horton, a veteran of Canada's U.S. Embassy, told The Hill Times in December that the Conservatives should properly have opened communication with the president-elect. ""No matter what happens with the election, Canada will still be dealing with the Trump administration for the next four years,"" she said. That same story also quoted Christopher Sands, director of the Canada Institute at the U.S.-based Wilson Center. ""I think he's let it go too long,"" said Sands. ""The sooner he's able to make the first connection, the better."" But Poilievre hasn't disclosed any public contact with the new White House. However, one of his MPs, Jamil Jivani, made a December visit to U.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance, a longtime friend. Rather, Poilievre's communication with the Trump administration has consisted mostly of hypothetically outlining what he would do as prime minister. In a podcast with Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson that received widespread circulation in the United States, Poilievre said he would negotiate a ""great deal"" with Trump that ""will make both countries safer, richer and stronger."" ""If you look at the history of President Trump, he negotiates very aggressively and he likes to win, but in the end, he doesn't appear to have a problem if his counterparty also wins,"" Poilievre said. As the deadline for a potential imposition of 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian imports has ticked closer, Poilievre has also stated that he would endorse retaliation. ""We would unfortunately and reluctantly have to retaliate against tariffs applied to our businesses,"" he told CTV News on Wednesday morning. ""And then we would go to the grassroots American economic interests that are on our side - the union leaders and business owners in the Midwest that use Canadian energy."" He said much the same on an interview last week with B.C.'s CHEK News. ""I would say to President Trump, I will retaliate with trade tariffs against American goods that are necessary to discourage America attacking our industries,"" he said. Candidates for the Liberal leadership have criticized Poilievre's approach to the Trump administration, with former finance minister Chrystia Freeland making the case that she would be a better negotiator with the Americans, and that the Tory leader would ""sell out"" Canada. A recent Ipsos poll finds that 77 per cent of Canadians favour an immediate election in order to give the federal government a mandate to deal with Trump. Although the poll didn't specifically ask what kind of mandate they would prefer, every available poll for at least the last six months has indicated that any general election would likely result in a Conservative landslide.

""The place of work is not important to me; it's about the result. I believe there needs to be proof that the work is done,"" he told interviewer Marie-Claude Julien. Federal employees have been fighting the Liberal government's attempts to order them back to the office part-time after the COVID-19 pandemic ended. His answer was noteworthy because Poilievre - whose suburban Carleton riding in Ottawa contains a significant number of federal public servants - has so far declined to say what he would do with the federal government's return-tooffice mandate. Surveys of employees ordered by both the federal government and public service unions have consistently shown high support among bureaucrats for remote work. Most federal public servants have recently been required to work from the office three days per week, and four days for executives. Asked how a Conservative government would measure whether work was being done, Poilievre mentioned ""clear tasks"" for the public service and monitoring to ensure work is completed. ""Right now, I see that the work isn't getting done in the federal government. We must put in place methods to ensure the work is done,"" he said. Poilievre's spokespeople did not respond to National Post questions Tuesday asking for more detail about the methods. Poilievre also said during the interview that he is the only party leader who can deal with the new Trump administration effectively. ""Obviously, you have to be ready for everything because the signals change from one minute to the next"" from a Trump government, he said. He added a Conservative government would not pull out of the World Health Organization, as Trump has ordered the United States to do. Poilievre took a swipe at Liberal leadership hopefuls Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney, saying they couldn't stand up to Trump. He said Freeland was ""very, very weak"" when she was foreign affairs minister negotiating with the Trump administration during its first mandate, and Carney is ""even weaker."" During her leadership campaign launch on Sunday, Freeland accused Poilievre of being ""weak"" and ready to bow down and sell Canada out to the U.S. ""He will never stand up to Donald Trump,"" Freeland said about Poilievre.

"Recall parliament; Listen to poilievre, and let mps get back to work now",2025.0,"However you interpret the American president's threats to cripple the Canadian economy for whichever of the illogical reasons he cites, and whatever anyone makes of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, he's dead right about this: Canada needs to quickly develop a plan for retaliatory tariffs, and that means Parliament has to be immediately reconvened. Unless and until that happens, all we have is a kind of extraparliamentary provisional government in the form of the Council of the Federation, which consists of 13 premiers of Canada's 10 provinces and the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Or rather 12 premiers, now that Alberta's Danielle Smith has struck out on her own to engage in freelance diplomacy on behalf of Alberta's oil companies. In any case, put them all together and they still have no constitutional authority to negotiate with a foreign power, which is Ottawa's business, and the council carries a national mandate every bit as tenuous as the hold Justin Trudeau maintains over the paralyzed federal government. As things stand, the House of Commons will remain effectively under lock and key until Justin Trudeau is replaced by his own party in a leadership race, Parliament is recalled and a failed confidence motion triggers a federal election. This rigmarole was precipitated by a prime minister whose own party and caucus wanted him gone even before Donald Trump decided to rampage onto the scene. It could end up prolonging Canada's democratic interregnum until early May. Faced with a rupture in Canada-U.S. relations that could cost 1.5 million Canadian jobs, a massive economic contraction and supply chain mayhem, just for starters, recalling the House just to formally and officially defeat the minority Liberals in a confidence vote would be wholly insufficient in light of the crisis Canada is facing. For one thing, the $1.3-billion border-armouring plan Ottawa announced last week, which will merely address one of the concocted pretexts President Trump has cited for his belligerence, is technically unfunded because there's no sitting Parliament to authorize the expenditure. ""We also need retaliatory tariffs, something that requires urgent Parliamentary consideration,"" Poilievre said Tuesday. This stands in stark contrast to the clever talk in certain Conservative circles that we shouldn't be talking about tariffs at all, that we should be trying to persuade the Americans how helpful we can be in their delusions of grandeur and Trump can be appeased if we just slobber on his slippers and bend to his will. request to prorogue Parliament to allow the Liberals time to pick his successor - a move which may have been unconstitutional. On Jan. 7, Trump said he intended to apply ""economic force"" to carry out his intention of absorbing Canada as the 51st American state. Last week, ruling on an application filed by the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, the Federal Court of Canada's Chief Justice Paul S. Crampton granted an expedited hearing on an ""urgent"" basis to consider the legality of the governor general's decision. In light of Trump's threats, Judge Crampton ruled against the Liberal government's lawyers: ""The fact remains that there would be no opportunity for Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions, including by availing itself of legislative tools at its disposal, for a significant period during which Canada will likely face a grave challenge."" Quite apart from the By all means, yes, the Americans should be made to understand how good a deal they're getting out of our $700-billion annual trading relationship, and yes, Canadian diplomats should make the case to American lawmakers that Trump's claims about Canada enjoying a $200-billion annual ""subsidy"" in the relationship is a jumble of falsehoods and illiteracy, but if it's a North American fortress they want we can help them build that, too, whatever it's supposed to mean. But all that is for Canadians to decide, through their own Parliament. And at the moment, we don't have one. ""Canada has never been so weak,"" Poilievre said, ""and things have never been so out of control. Liberals are putting themselves and their leadership politics ahead of the country."" That's a hard argument to beat. On Jan. 6, Gov.-Gen. Mary Simon granted Trudeau his sloppy constitutional hygiene involved, to prorogue Parliament at a moment like this, and for the reasons Trudeau offered, was contemptuous of Canadian democracy. ""Open Parliament. Take back control,"" Poilievre said Tuesday. ""Put Canada First."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford seems to be ready to do just that. Wanting what he's called a ""clear mandate"" to ask for what could be painful sacrifices from Ontarians in the adoption of retaliatory actions against U.S. business interests, the Ontario Conservative leadership has alerted the party that a provincial election is likely imminent. ""I'm going to use every tool in the tool box to protect the people of Ontario,"" Ford said. ""We need a clear mandate, not for tomorrow, not for the next day, for four years of dealing with our American friends."" So does the federal government. Trump did not follow through with his pledge to sign an executive order immediately after his inauguration on Monday to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. Instead, after affixing his signature to dozens of executive orders, Trump told reporters the 25 per cent tariffs will be in place Feb. 1, because Canada, like Mexico, is ""allowing vast numbers of people ... and fentanyl to come in."" Canada is not allowing vast numbers of people or significant amounts of fentanyl to enter the United States, especially when compared with Mexico. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials say 19.5 kilograms of fentanyl was seized at Canadian border points last year, compared to 9,570 kilograms seized on the U.S. Mexico border. U.S. officials recorded more than two million ""encounters"" on the Mexico border last year, about 10 times the number of encounters on the Canada-U.S. border, and ""encounters"" can mean all sorts of situations. Whatever the Feb. 1 deadline turns out to mean, Trump has given his officials until April 1 to prepare a report on migrants and fentanyl from Mexico, Canada and China. So there's time to talk sense to American lawmakers, and as chair of the Council of the Federation, Ontario's Ford will be leading a delegation to Washington, D.C. on Feb. 12 ""to advocate for maintaining strong Canada-U.S. relations."" On the agenda: employment, the economy, energy, critical mineral supply chains, border security and immigration. While American law grants the president tremendous leeway in foreign trade and in the executive application of tariffs, Congress can restrain the president if it wants to, and there are midterm elections two years down the road. The Republicans enjoy a small majority in the Senate, 53-47, and in the House their edge is paper thin: 218-215. So there's hope that if Trump means war, and Canada retaliates with tariffs or export restrictions that make key states and districts sting, we might be able to fight this thing. But we need a plan. Ottawa needs a mandate. And for that we need a Parliament, and we need it now.

"Treasured tails of a beloved feline:   My calico cat Miranda’s independent and curious spirit will continue to fill my life with joy, no matter her age, David L. Clark writes",2025.0,"Calico cats are said in some places to bring good luck. I know that ours did. When we discovered Miranda as a kitten in our yard she had fallen down a hole in the back deck and couldn’t get out. Her feral mother, whom we had fed for years, couldn’t reach down far enough to retrieve her little daughter. But Miranda called out loudly, and we heard her and we have never stopped listening since. That was 21 years ago. We call Miranda our wedding gift to each other because we brought her into our lives in the months leading up to our nuptials. Or did she find us? They say that we live only part of our lives with a cat, whereas they live almost their entire life with us, but truthfully that is not at all how my wife, Tracy, and I feel about Miranda: She has so folded herself into our world that she feels like she has never not been part of it. It’s not that I cannot recall a time without her. No, it is that that time doesn’t matter as much, doesn’t seem as complete as it should or could have been. That former time was missing something even if I didn’t then know what that absence was. I realize now that Miranda will never not be part of us in the future too, no matter what that future holds. This calico, she is a time traveller. Notwithstanding her advanced age, Miranda is still amazingly strong, her orange and black and white coat is as dramatically defined as ever, her short fur is well-kept and velvety soft to the touch. She has never weighed more than five pounds but she concentrates a lot of life into that small frame. She lost her hearing several years ago and yet that changed nothing about her demeanour, her curiosity, her determination. Miranda has lots of what the ancient Greeks called “thymos,” a term that means “heart” or “spiritness.” She has always been vocal, always has something to say, even if she says things a bit more loudly these days and nights, unable to hear herself speak. She is unsteady on the stairs, so we let her have free range of the lower level of our home, where there is lots of natural light and lots of spaces to explore. She sleeps. And sleeps. Sometimes I sit nearby just to watch her sleep. Why is observing a beloved feline while she dreams so deeply pleasurable? I cannot quite describe the joy of watching her like this, curled up, nose to tail, her little chest rising and falling almost imperceptibly. As I sit nearby, I feel my own pulse slow and the weight of day lift. I feel happy but mostly I feel happy for her. We are together, alone. That is enough. She is enough. She has never needed to be anything more than what she already is. Miranda asks for so little… and yet she gives so much. She is wondrously independent, with her own wants and needs, and yet somehow she also endlessly and selflessly gives herself away. I do not know how this miracle works. Recently Miranda has begun to wake up at night and cry out. She did earlier this week and so Tracy and I crept downstairs where we squished together on the narrow sofa and let Miranda lie on top of us. She nested a bit, and quieted, and then fell asleep. We lay there for hours in the dark, big flakes of snow falling silently outside, saying nothing while listening to Miranda’s small throaty breaths, her almost inaudible purr. We three were at peace. The great British poet, painter and engraver, William Blake, whose work I have taught for decades as an English professor, once wrote these memorable words: “There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find.” What does Blake mean by this strange phrase? Create, discover and cherish those fleeting openings in which you turn away from those things that claw away at you and that threaten to make you less than the person you want and need to be. In a deeply dismaying and disastrous world, shelter the ephemeral occasions for respite, for togetherness, for forgiveness. A little calico can make those moments possible. And she does so by just being herself. David L. Clark lives in Toronto. First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell?

Lions coach campbell sets his sights on next season,2025.0,"It's one down for the Detroit Lions and likely another still to go. The long expected departure of Lions offensive co-ordinator Ben Johnson was announced on social media by his agency, Priority Sports, that he would be the next head coach of the Chicago Bears. It's not the only staff loss the Lions are expecting this off-season with defensive co-ordinator Aaron Glenn set to do a second interview for the New York Jets'vacant head coach post, and if he is not hired, he will then have a second interview with the New Orleans Saints. ""I would expect to lose both, but I haven't been told anything,"" Lions head coach Dan Campbell said hours before news of Johnson's departure became public. ""I just, I've got a feeling, but I'm prepared to lose both."" Johnson was hired as an offensive quality control coach in 2019 and promoted to tight ends coach in 2020. Campbell retained him when he was hired in 2021 after Matt Patricia was fired. In Campbell's first season, Johnson was promoted to pass game co-ordinator after Anthony Lynn was fired as offensive co-ordinator when the team started 0-8. Johnson was promoted to offensive co-ordinator after the season. Under the 38-year-old Johnson, Detroit has had a top 10 offence the past two seasons and the club's 28.2 offensive points per game from 2022 to 2024 in the most in the NFL. Like the club has all season in dealing with injuries, Campbell said in no way does the departure of one or both co-ordinators diminish his feeling the club will remain a Super Bowl contender. ""Our window is open,"" Campbell said. ""That's my job, to replenish and find the next man up and the guy who's going to give us the best chance to have success on both sides of the ball. Absolutely, it would be a loss, but yet man, we move forward. This train rolls and I'll find the next best guys for us."" Campbell believes there are people currently on Detroit's staff that could be promoted to fill either role. ""I think we've got guys on staff that I think are more than qualified and would be outstanding in those roles, but that does not mean that I'm not looking outside either,"" Campbell said. ""So, I'm not going to be in a hurry. I'm not in a mad dash. ""No matter what happens, I want to do what's right by our team ... that those guys will be able to stand in front of that room and command respect and get everybody going in the same direction and will, ultimately, deliver the same message that I'm delivering."" When he was hired by the Lions, Campbell was a first-time head coach and hiring Lynn, who was a former head coach, seemed like the perfect fit to get experience on the staff. But, as Campbell has grown, and Johnson has shown, it's not always about experience being the key to success and the former NFL tight end has his own offensive ideas. ""What do you learn?"" Campbell said. ""OK man, I just need (to) make sure that I am heavily involved, however we go. Man, I am very offensive heavy, I think is the best way to say that. I'm going to be involved, no matter what, because I think that's best for our offence."" Despite Saturday's disappointing loss to the Washington Commanders in the divisional playoffs, Campbell said the philosophy of the team will not change. ""What we are is what we are and we've been that way since I've been here,"" Campbell said. ""A couple of things will get tweaked, just the nature of new co-ordinators if that happens, because you want it to be kind of their flavour, their style with it, but yet what I want is what we're going to do and what we're about."" jpparker@postmedia.com twitter.com/winstarparker","The Windsor Star; Windsor, Ont.","Windsor, Ont.","Parker, Jim",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 22, 2025",Professional football,"Nom: National Football League--NFL; NAICS: 711211, 813990",2025-01-22,The Windsor Star
Capital gains 'reverse' a return to common sense; Poilievre vows to undo Liberal changes,2025.0,"One might quibble on what Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre meant last week when he said he would ""reverse"" the Liberals' capital gains proposals, but his statement is quite clear that his party will either not proceed with the proposals should they not be law at the time if and when they form government, or they will unwind the proposals if such proposals are effective law at the time. Presently, the proposals are not law, but it is still technically possible that a new Liberal leader might strike a deal with the NDP to extend Parliament to try to get them passed into law. Like many Canadians, I really hope that does not happen. Poilievre last week also re-emphasized his Economic Vandalism video that he released last June 2024 in which he made an announcement that he would convene a Tax Reform Task Force within 60 days of forming a government. The task force would be charged with coming up with ideas to lower taxes on work, hiring and ""making stuff ""; reduce the share of taxes paid by the poor and middle-income earners; and reduce paperwork by 20 per cent by simplifying tax rules. In summary: lower, simpler, fairer. For a tax practitioner like me, I was pleased to hear about this last June and, of course, again last week. Our country's taxation policies over the past nine-plus years have been very destructive and damaging, in particular to entrepreneurs, the lifeblood of our democracy. With the Liberal party leadership race now in full bloom, it's worth a quick review of the two frontrunners' taxation policies. Mark Carney has been an inside adviser (despite his loud assertions that he's an ""outsider"") to the Liberal party or the government for the past few years. He has been directly or indirectly involved in the implementation of some of the poorest taxation policies our country has seen in decades. Even before his advisory role, he was a cheerleader of this government's policies that have directly or indirectly attacked our entrepreneurs. Such attacks have led to an unprecedented departure of successful Canadians from Canada. While Carney has an impressive educational and career background, he appears to have zero entrepreneurial experience and little appreciation for how hard it is for entrepreneurs to be successful, despite his assertions that he understands ""how the economy works."" There has been little attempt by him, as far as I can tell, to even attempt to connect with the entrepreneurial class. As for Chrystia Freeland, our country's economy has been under her tutelage for the past five years. Under her watch, our economic performance has tanked to dangerously low productivity levels and she has introduced a multitude of ridiculous new taxation policies. Her track record speaks for itself despite her recent attempt to try to distance herself from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Also last week, I received a surprise gift from another tax practitioner. Like me, he is a fan of studying economics and the gift was the fifth edition of American economist Thomas Sowell's classic textbook Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy, released in 2015. Sowell, along with Canada's own Jack Mintz, are geniuses when it comes to the study and common-sense application of economics. I spent some time with the book over the weekend reminding myself of Sowell's comments on taxation and his views on tariffs (suffice it to say, he's not a big fan). In light of the above backdrop - Poilievre's previous announcement of a Tax Reform Task Force should the Conservatives get elected, the Liberal leadership race, the looming imposition of tariffs by Donald Trump and the receipt of my gift - I thought it would be good to revisit a few of Sowell's previous teachings on taxation policy since the focus on policy, rather than simple politics, is a good thing. ""The real cost of taxes is not what we send to the government, but what the economy loses because taxes reduce incentives for productive behaviour,"" he said. The past nine years have been a textbook example of how poor taxation policy can drive undesirable behaviour. For example, the exodus of successful Canadians from the country has been unprecedented. We desperately need to reverse that. The politics of envy leads to very bad economics under the guise of fairness is another one of Sowell's thoughts. I've lost count of how many times over the past nine years that the word ""fairness"" and other divisive rhetoric have been used to try to justify poor taxation policy. The capital gains proposals are a recent example of this, with Freeland pulling out some really doozy statements that still get me riled up every time I think about them. Sowell also said the tax code is so complex that it creates opportunities for evasion, and wasteful compliance costs. The ""tax code"" is an American reference (in Canada, the code is the ""Income Tax Act""), but the implication is the same. There is not a single tax practitioner that I know of in Canada that thinks the act, or its related administration, is ""simple."" The complexity of it makes our tax system unapproachable for the average Canadian. A significant effort to reduce complexity needs to happen. With the above quotes in mind, I couldn't help but notice that it fits nicely into the proposed objectives of the Conservative Party's Tax Reform Task Force objectives of lower, simpler, fairer, with the word fairer certainly not being used in this context to promote the politics of envy. Are turn to com-mon-sense tax and economic policy cannot come soon enough.

Capital gains 'reverse' a return to common sense; Comment; poilievre vows to undo liberal changes,,"One might quibble on what Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre meant last week when he said he would ""reverse"" the Liberals'capital gains proposals, but his statement is quite clear that his party will either not proceed with the proposals should they not be law at the time if and when they form government, or they will unwind the proposals if such proposals are effective law at the time. Presently, the proposals are not law, but it is still technically possible that a new Liberal leader might strike a deal with the NDP to extend Parliament to try to get them passed into law. Like many Canadians, I really hope that does not happen. Poilievre last week also re-emphasized his Economic Vandalism video that he released last June 2024 in which he made an announcement that he would convene a Tax Reform Task Force within 60 days of forming a government. The task force would be charged with coming up with ideas to lower taxes on work, hiring and ""making stuff ""; reduce the share of taxes paid by the poor and middle-income earners; and reduce paperwork by 20 per cent by simplifying tax rules. In summary: lower, simpler, fairer. For a tax practitioner like me, I was pleased to hear about this last June and, of course, again last week. Our country's taxation policies over the past nine-plus years have been very destructive and damaging, in particular to entrepreneurs, the lifeblood of our democracy. With the Liberal party leadership race now in full bloom, it's worth a quick review of the two frontrunners'taxation policies. Mark Carney has been an inside adviser (despite his loud assertions that he's an ""outsider"") to the Liberal party or the government for the past few years. He has been directly or indirectly involved in the implementation of some of the poorest taxation policies our country has seen in decades. Even before his advisory role, he was a cheerleader of this government's policies that have directly or indirectly attacked our entrepreneurs. Such attacks have led to an unprecedented departure of successful Canadians from Canada. While Carney has an impressive educational and career background, he appears to have zero entrepreneurial experience and little appreciation for how hard it is for entrepreneurs to be successful, despite his assertions that he understands ""how the economy works."" There has been little attempt by him, as far as I can tell, to even attempt to connect with the entrepreneurial class. As for Chrystia Freeland, our country's economy has been under her tutelage for the past five years. Under her watch, our economic performance has tanked to dangerously low productivity levels and she has introduced a multitude of ridiculous new taxation policies. Her track record speaks for itself despite her recent attempt to try to distance herself from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Also last week, I received a surprise gift from another tax practitioner. Like me, he is a fan of studying economics and the gift was the fifth edition of American economist Thomas Sowell's classic textbook Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy, released in 2015. Sowell, along with Canada's own Jack Mintz, are geniuses when it comes to the study and common-sense application of economics. I spent some time with the book over the weekend reminding myself of Sowell's comments on taxation and his views on tariffs (suffice it to say, he's not a big fan). In light of the above backdrop - Poilievre's previous announcement of a Tax Reform Task Force should the Conservatives get elected, the Liberal leadership race, the looming imposition of tariffs by Donald Trump and the receipt of my gift - I thought it would be good to revisit a few of Sowell's previous teachings on taxation policy since the focus on policy, rather than simple politics, is a good thing. ""The real cost of taxes is not what we send to the government, but what the economy loses because taxes reduce incentives for productive behaviour,"" he said. The past nine years have been a textbook example of how poor taxation policy can drive undesirable behaviour. For example, the exodus of successful Canadians from the country has been unprecedented. We desperately need to reverse that. The politics of envy leads to very bad economics under the guise of fairness is another one of Sowell's thoughts. I've lost count of how many times over the past nine years that the word ""fairness"" and other divisive rhetoric have been used to try to justify poor taxation policy. The capital gains proposals are a recent example of this, with Freeland pulling out some really doozy statements that still get me riled up every time I think about them. Sowell also said the tax code is so complex that it creates opportunities for evasion, and wasteful compliance costs. The ""tax code"" is an American reference (in Canada, the code is the ""Income Tax Act""), but the implication is the same. There is not a single tax practitioner that I know of in Canada that thinks the act, or its related administration, is ""simple."" The complexity of it makes our tax system unapproachable for the average Canadian. A significant effort to reduce complexity needs to happen. With the above quotes in mind, I couldn't help but notice that it fits nicely into the proposed objectives of the Conservative Party's Tax Reform Task Force objectives of lower, simpler, fairer, with the word fairer certainly not being used in this context to promote the politics of envy.

Poilievre's lack of policies exposed; Letters to the editor,2025.0,"All we have heard from the federal Conservative leader are shallow slogans, catchphrases and meaningless schoolyard taunts. His only policy was to attack Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which became a tired refrain bereft of any visionary qualities. ""Axe the tax, spike the hike, common-sense Conservatives"": is he in Grade 3? This is a man who chummed around with the freedom convoy people and is currently turning himself into a pretzel trying to cover up his love-in for Trump and somehow stand up for his own country. Yes, it was time for Trudeau to step down, but Pierre Poilievre is a lost soul without someone he can heap abuse on.

Poilievre can't be trusted to Negotiate with Trump: Sudbury MP,2025.0,"President-elect Donald Trump has been openly musing in his trademark style about his intentions for Canada. What began as an economic threat to Canada in the form of a 25 per cent tariff has evolved - or devolved - into what many correctly perceive to be a threat to Canada's sovereignty with the suggestion we become the 51st state of the United States of America. As the clock ticks down to Jan. 20 to Trump's second inauguration, one thing is clear: whether on the matter of our economy, our jobs, our water or our sovereignty, Canadians need to think long and hard about who to send to the negotiating table. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce released a report in November raising the alarm on the economic fallout of Trump's proposed 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian goods entering the U.S. According to Stephen Tapp, chief economist with the chamber, Canada's GDP would shrink by $78 billion, costing Canadians nearly $2,000 per person each year. Tapp further surmises that under such conditions, Canada's economy would be pushed into a recession. Equally alarming are the potential job losses for Canada, estimated as high as 1.5 million jobs. The economic peril to Canada requires significant focus by our federal government. It also demands thoughtful planning and preparation by an experienced team. Canadians should take heed of the Conservative plan for dealing with the threat. Recent polling reveals that 20 per cent of Conservatives support Canada becoming part of the United States. Former Conservative candidate, Kevin O'Leary, has offered to broker a deal with Trump (on whose authority we do not know), telling a New York Post reporter that ""half of his countrymen would support such a merger."" Likewise, Pierre Poilievre's plans to try and topple the government in January - 10 months ahead of an already scheduled election - demonstrate a reckless, self-serving abandonment of Canada and Canadians at an incredibly fragile time in our relationship with the U.S. Compare that to the actions of the current federal government. A team was struck ahead of the U.S. election to map out a plan, whatever the outcome. The team is meeting with premiers to ensure a unified approach. In December, a meeting was requested and granted with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump's tariff threat stems from an ostensible desire to pressure Canada and Mexico to curb migration and drug trafficking, specifically fentanyl, at the border. It is also driven by Trump's buy American plan. At the Mar-a-Lago meeting, the Canadian team reiterated the facts on migration and drug trafficking. Less than one per cent of migrants enter the U.S. from Canada. As for fentanyl entering the U.S., that figure is less than 0.1 per cent. Nevertheless, the federal government unveiled a plan for further strengthening the U.S.-Canada border. Compare that to Poilievre's hastily-called news conference where he displayed a fix the broken border sign, an odd performance that had him defending Trump. As for Trump's goals for an enhanced U.S. economy, members of Team Canada were quick to make known Canada's economic importance to the U.S. Trump's proposed tariffs would come at a significant cost for American businesses, rendering American production more expensive, and ultimately less competitive globally. Job losses and higher consumer prices are predicted, which go directly against Trump's purported economic agenda. If the tariffs weren't enough, there is another threat to Canada: the USA's keen interest in our water. In the midst of the American election, many Canadians took note of Trump's description of a large tap with a valve that could re-direct water from Canada to the U.S. Canada contains 20 per cent of the world's fresh water and it is a precious resource worth protecting. At a 2023 United Nations Water Summit, experts forecasted that global demand for fresh water will outpace supply by more than 40 per cent by 2033. America, too, is running out. Stephen Harper proved a Conservative government cannot be trusted, as he and his Cabinet introduced legal precedents that would allow foreign investors to declare propriety claims on our water. As the Globe and Mail reported: ""Stephen Harper and company would treat water like oil or any other commodity - pump it and dump it south of the border as fast as possible with no regard to the long-term consequences."" Canadians should not trust Poilievre - a Harper-era Conservative - to uphold water as a fundamental public trust above private and corporate interests. As Canadians head to the ballot box this year, the question of who will best protect the interests of Canada will be paramount. Elon Musk's recent tweet supporting Poilievre should be viewed as a harbinger of Canada's fate. Trump and his allies are telling us who they want - and who they believe - will give them the best deal. Poilievre won't deliver us from Trump, he'll deliver us to Trump. After our own federal election this year - after the die has been cast - it will be too late. Let's not deliver our future into the hands of Donald Trump.

PQ Leader challenges Poilievre to debate; Riled by remarks,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre's recent interview with Jordan Peterson was popular with a lot of people, judging by its nearly four million YouTube views. But Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon didn't like what he heard, and he's spoiling for a fight with the federal Conservative leader in what looks like a preview of what Poilievre can expect as he faces off against Quebec nationalists in an upcoming federal election. Appearing on Peterson's podcast earlier this month, Poilievre said that if the separatist PQ is comfortably leading in the polls provincially, it's because of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After all, he said, separatists ""had been completely obliterated in the Harper era."" ""Separatism was completely dead in Quebec and now it's making a resurgence and... the leader of the PQ has actually been making economic arguments in favour of separatism,"" Poilievre said. But because the Liberal government ""has been such a colossal disaster for our national economy, the separatists are now able to make the argument that they would be better off separating from that calamity."" For Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, known as PSPP, the remarks were too rich. He said Poilievre showed ""a contempt for Quebec in a context where the independence movement is only (perceived as) a threat."" ""That's all it comes down to. There is no will to understand. There is no will to give legitimacy to demands that are in fact identical in some respects to Canadian demands,"" he said at a Jan. 7 press conference. Poilievre always seems ready to advocate for Western Canada, St-Pierre Plamondon said. What, he demanded, would the Conservative leader, if elected prime minister, do for Quebec? ""The immediate future of Quebec in Canada, under a Pierre Poilievre government, does not bode well,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said. The two have been sparring back and forth ever since. ""I'm not here to defend the interests of one region over another. I'm here to restore Canada's promise so that everyone who works hard can earn a good living, buy an affordable home, and raise a family in a safe neighbourhood,"" Poilievre said in a social media post a few days later. The Tory leader then went on the offensive, attacking the PQ leader. ""You are afraid that a Conservative government will respect Quebec's autonomy because it would undermine your arguments in favour of sovereignty,"" he said. Quebecers, who are accustomed to being wooed by political leaders, are still waiting for Poilievre to tell them what he plans to offer their province. His predecessors had proposals specifically for Quebec, and former federal Tory leader Erin O'Toole presented a ""Quebec platform"" in the 2021 election. Stephen Harper's Conservative government even passed a motion in the House of Commons ""that Quebecers form a nation within a united Canada."" Poilievre says he believes in ""responsible federalism,"" while arguing that Harper's approach shows Quebec gets more respect from Conservatives than it has during nine years of Liberal government. As prime minister, he said, ""Quebecers will be winners."" At least some Quebecers, it seems, have yet to be convinced. ""This is an initial position, but when he talks about 'responsible federalism', it is a new expression that his Conservative predecessors did not necessarily use. He will have to clarify his thinking in relation to what this can mean concretely for Quebec,"" said Marc-André Leclerc, who was chief of staff for then Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. St-Pierre Plamondon's party won't be on the ballot in the upcoming federal election, but because it's polling as the most popular provincial party in Quebec, its leader has managed to get Poilievre's attention, and perhaps under his skin, too. He asked Poilievre if he would commit to legislating to prohibit federal spending power in areas of provincial jurisdiction, to stop challenging Quebec's controversial Bill 21 restricting religious symbols for some public employees, to give Quebec full power over immigration to the province and over cultural spending in the province. That wasn't all: St-Pierre Plamondon has challenged Poilievre to commit to increasing the federal health transfer to Quebec to $6 billion (Trudeau turned that same request down last year, offering $900 million instead). He's also calling on the Conservatives to promise never to let an oil pipeline pass through Quebec, and to cancel any federal financial incentives to the oil and gas industry. And he wants Poilievre to vow that he'll let Quebec have a single tax return and collect revenue on behalf of both governments, something Conservatives have backed in the past. ""I also offer to debate these fundamental issues in person, to get to the heart of the matter,"" wrote St-Pierre Plamondon on social media. He hasn't yet got an answer. Conservatives did not respond when National Post asked. But that may work just fine for St-Pierre Plamondon, whose shadow boxing with Conservatives only improves his standing provincially, said Geneviève Tellier, political science professor at the University of Ottawa. ""It gives him an opponent against whom he knows he will score points because on certain issues Pierre Poilievre will have difficulty defending himself,"" she said. When the PQ dares the Conservative leader to stand with Quebec against multiculturalism, Poilievre can't really win, said Tellier. ""But it would be difficult for him to say 'oh no, no, I don't like that.'I mean, there is a consensus in Canada. So, there are certainly advantages for PSPP in asking to confront Poilievre,"" she said. St-Pierre Plamondon knows that separatist sentiment in Quebec isn't exactly boiling over: it's been stable for months at around 35 per cent. Yet the PQ hasn't been this popular in decades - in large part because of the sinking fortunes of Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec government. It may not last. Like Poilievre, PSPP is leading a popular opposition party that's salivating for an election, scheduled in Quebec for next year. By then, they could both find themselves in very different situations, said Leclerc. ""The two will have to work together, because even for Mr. St-Pierre Plamondon, if he wins the election, there will be no referendum two weeks later. He will have no choice but to work with the federal government, and he will have no choice but to gain things,"" he said. ""And that will involve collaborating with Pierre Poilievre.""

Christy Clark missed her chance,2025.0,"On Tuesday, former B.C. premier Christy Clark plopped out of the federal Liberal leadership race with the usual brusque announcement on X. It is not too much to say that Clark became something of a national laughingstock last week after insisting on her perfect federal-Liberal bona fides. After announcing her prospective candidacy, she insisted that she had never been a member of the federal Conservative party. Thousands of people immediately flashed back to years of close co-operation between her BC Liberals and the federal Conservatives. Others recollected that she was a very public supporter of Jean Charest in the 2022 CPC leadership race, and that she had specifically declared her intention to join the CPC and cast a vote for Charest. She tried to weasel out by telling a CBC journalist that she had never actually followed through and bought a membership, and if you turned one ear to the west, you could actually hear British Columbians snickering and saying, ""Yup, that's our Christy."" Present-day CPC officials hastened to publish documentation showing that she had joined the Conservatives, receiving a sky-high quantitative ranking in the CPC database for political reliability, and that she had voted in their race. In her valediction, Clark didn't say anything about having commenced her campaign by insisting, almost to the point of getting a little shirty about it, on an easily refuted lie. She instead complained that Liberal candidates like her hadn't been given enough time to mount a proper national campaign, adding, ""I have worked hard at improving my French but it's not where it needs to be today."" As a result, she added, the Liberal party is incapable of appealing to ""a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of (Conservative Leader) Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" It's this last claim that fascinates me. Even in Conservative circles there's something of an argument over whether the woeful state of Liberal polling reflects extreme fatigue with Justin Trudeau personally or a popular revolt against the Liberal party per se. (A few weirdos may even think it possible that Poilievre is an outstanding political communicator who has successfully left his attack-dog reputation behind, and who enjoys legitimate personal popularity.) The Liberal race will be, in part, a test of these folk theories: even before the vote we'll learn just how much, to the nearest ounce, Trudeau was weighing the party down. But there are certainly some voters who, broadly speaking, would like small-c conservative policies delivered by someone other than a Conservative, or by someone other than Pierre Poilievre. So why couldn't Clark just have run explicitly as what she is: a longtime Conservative fellow-traveller, one with a pretty impressive electoral and economic track record in B.C., who thinks Poilievre needs to be challenged? Are the Liberals completely doomed to choose someone from the Trudeau rogue's gallery, someone who has the imprimatur of the same political machine operators who have been running the Prime Minister's Office for a decade? Clark has been stealthily flashing her dimples as a potential Trudeau successor for years, and had in fact been working hard in recent months to build support. Why did a well-placed and experienced change candidate refuse to go ahead and be that? Does anyone really think her loyalty to the federal Liberal gang was a legitimate, important issue?

"Liberal race loses more big names; Champagne, Clark bow out, Gould is in, Carney is",2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne both announced on Tuesday they won't run to become leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Meanwhile, Liberal House leader Karina Gould is expected to launch her leadership campaign later this week. Clark, who was one of the most prominent potential candidates, announced to supporters Tuesday morning that ""there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language."" ""I have worked hard at improving my French, but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she wrote in an email sent to supporters. Many prominent Liberals, including Champagne, recently said the next leader must speak French and understand Quebec. In her email, Clark wrote that, despite the fact she has been able to assemble a team of ""hundreds"" of organizers from across the country, she has ""made the difficult decision to step back."" She first broke it to them over a Zoom call with about 40 organizers roughly 20 minutes before her news went public. She has spent months laying the groundwork for a potential bid before dropping out. As late as Sunday evening, she was sending emails to supporters and meeting with organizers. Clark's decision comes just days after she claimed to have misspoken to the CBC Radio show The House, when she repeatedly denied ever having been a member of the federal Conservative party and voting in its 2022 leadership race, despite having declared so in previous speeches and media interviews. Clark didn't mention the CBC interview, which aired over the weekend, in her email to supporters and instead pointed to the short time frame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left for prospective contenders. ""The timing of the prime minister's resignation just did not leave enough time for the party to build a process that will renew and grow our party,"" said Clark. ""Our party must still find a way to generate new momentum and energy. To open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" Hours later, Champagne told a group of Toronto business people that he would not run to become the next prime minister. ""I thought about it carefully. I came to the conclusion that I will not be seeking the leadership in this race. It was probably the most difficult decision in my life, but I think it is the right one at this time,"" Champagne told journalist Amanda Lang at the Canadian Club. That means no francophones or prominent Quebec candidates will run to succeed Trudeau, himself a Quebecer. Champagne was considered the Quebec Liberals'last great hope in the race.Despite his decision the tradition of alternating between an anglophone and a francophone leader at the head of the party will prevail, said Jeremy Ghio, a former political staffer to Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a director at the communication firm Tact in Montreal ""There is no message to Quebecers here. The only thing we can see in this is that those who hoped that the principle of alternation would be a thing of the past have their answer. It is not a thing of the past,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, a source close to Gould said she plans to launch her leadership campaign this week. Prospective candidates have until Jan. 23 to register to run and until Jan. 27 to sign up new members. The winner will be announced on March 9. Speaking at an unrelated news conference in her Burlington, Ont., riding, Gould declined to confirm her intentions, saying only: ""I'll have more to say in the coming days."" The tight constraints of the race, which includes the requirement to raise $350,000, has meant other potential successors to Trudeau have bowed out of the contest, such as Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon. More prominent cabinet ministers, such as Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, cited the need to dedicate energy to bracing for incoming U.S president-elect Donald Trump, who is threatening to slap 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods. Gould, who was first elected in 2015, would be the youngest candidate in the race at 37 and the only Millennial. She made history as the youngest woman appointed to cabinet and the first minister to take maternity leave. Her plan to enter the race comes amid growing anxieties about the ability for those under 40 to own a home and at a time when many of the young progressives who first voted for Trudeau back in 2015 have turned away from the party. ""I think it is extremely important that we have a younger voice in the race who can relate to people where they are and the struggles that they're facing today,"" she told reporters in Burlington. Other expected contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who one source has said is expected to launch his campaign this week, and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, whose team has not been as definitive on timing. A source close to Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who is in Washington ahead of Trump's inauguration next week, said he is still mulling a potential bid.","Chronicle - Herald; Halifax, N.S.","Halifax, N.S.",Stephanie Taylor and Antoine Trépanier,CNW Group Ltd.,"Jan 16, 2025",Political campaigns; Leadership; Francophones; Candidates; Maternity & paternity leaves; Prime ministers,,2025-01-16,Chronicle - Herald
Clark opts not to run for Grit leadership; Former B.C. premier says she is not fluent enough in French to lead Liberals nationally,2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark, who was considering a run for the federal Liberal leadership, says she's made the difficult decision to step back. ""There are vitally important issues that need to be addressed - confronting an aggressive U.S. trade threat, fighting for a strong, united Canada, and restoring faith in our institutions. But, most important of all, getting Canada's economy firing on all cylinders again,"" Clark said Tuesday in a message to supporters. Although Clark said she has been working on her French, she hasn't become fluent. ""While we have come a long way, in a short time, there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language. I have worked hard at improving my French but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she said. Clark said the Liberal party must find a way to generate new momentum and energy, and open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out. ""I won't be in this leadership race, but I won't stop fighting. Pierre Poilievre would rather attack Canadians than call out Donald Trump. ""He's a bully when he's here at home and a pathetic pushover for the MAGA Republicans. We don't need Governor Poilievre. ""We need the Liberal party at the top of its game,"" said Clark. Last week, Clark backtracked on her claim that she'd never been a member of the Conservative party. She told CBC Radio's The House that she was ""very seriously"" considering a leadership bid, but expressed disappointment with the short timeline for the race. She also denied she voted for former Quebec premier Jean Charest in his bid to become Conservative leader in 2022, a race that was won by Poilievre. Clark, who has called herself a ""lifelong Liberal,"" said in the interview that despite publicly supporting Charest's leadership run she never joined the party and never received a ballot for the race. The Liberal party said the new leader will be named March 9 to replace outgoing leader Justin Trudeau. Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney has suggested he will launch a leadership bid this week. Former Montreal MP Frank Baylis and Nepean, Ont., MP Chandra Arya have said they plan to run. - With files from The Canadian Press","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Crawford, Tiffany",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 15, 2025",Leadership,,2025-01-15,The Province
"Clark, Champagne take a pass; High-profile potential liberal leader candidates bow out, house leader gould expected to jump in",2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne both announced on Tuesday they won't run to become leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Meanwhile, Liberal House leader Karina Gould is expected to launch her leadership campaign later this week. Clark, who was one of the most prominent potential candidates, announced to supporters Tuesday morning that ""there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language."" ""I have worked hard at improving my French, but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she wrote in an email to supporters. Many prominent Liberals, including Champagne, have said the next leader must speak French and understand Quebec. In that email, Clark wrote that despite the fact she has been able to assemble a team of ""hundreds"" of organizers from across the country, she has ""made the difficult decision to step back."" She broke the news over a Zoom call with about 40 organizers roughly 20 minutes before her news went public. Clark's decision comes after she claimed to have misspoken to the CBC Radio show The House when she repeatedly denied ever having been a member of the federal Conservative party and voting in its 2022 leadership race, despite having declared so in previous speeches and media interviews. Clark didn't mention the CBC interview in her email to supporters and instead pointed to the short time frame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left for prospective contenders, given his decision to announce on Jan. 6 he was stepping down. ""The timing of the prime minister's resignation just did not leave enough time for the party to build a process that will renew and grow our party,"" said Clark. ""Our party must still find a way to generate new momentum and energy. To open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" Hours later, Champagne told a group of Toronto business people that he would not run to become Canada's next prime minister. ""I thought about it carefully. I came to the conclusion that I will not be seeking the leadership in this race. It was probably the most difficult decision in my life, but I think it is the right one at this time,"" Champagne told journalist Amanda Lang at the Canadian Club. That means no francophones or prominent Quebec candidates will run to succeed Trudeau, himself a Quebecer. Champagne was considered the Quebec Liberals'last great hope in the race, and he was seriously considering running. The historical tradition of alternating between an anglophone and a francophone leader at the head of the party will prevail. ""There is no message to Quebecers here. The only thing we can see in this is that those who hoped that the principle of alternation would be a thing of the past have their answer. It is not a thing of the past,"" said Jeremy Ghio, a former political staffer to Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a director at the communication firm Tact in Montreal. Earlier on Tuesday, a source close to Government House Leader Karina Gould said she plans to launch her campaign to become the next leader this week. Prospective candidates have until Jan. 23 to register to run and until Jan. 27 to sign up new members. The winner will be announced on March 9. The tight constraints of the race, which includes the requirement to raise $350,000, has meant other potential successors to Trudeau have bowed out. Gould, who was first elected in 2015, would be the youngest candidate in the race at 37 and the only Millennial. Other expected contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank governor Mark Carney and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Gould serves as the government's House Leader and before that was the minister responsible for shepherding the signing of national child care deals with provinces and territories.

"Carney rips Poilievre, teases run for Liberals; Late-night tv",2025.0,"Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney used an interview on U.S. late-night television to attack Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and make his case for the Liberal leadership. In an interview with The Daily Show host Jon Stewart Monday night, Carney didn't definitively say he would seek to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but he did say that a ""hypothetical"" outsider candidate was better positioned to run for the job while U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on Canadian goods. The National Post reported last week that Carney is likely to launch his campaign this week. Carney wasn't shy about attacking Poilie vre after Stewart said Poilievre seemed ""very off-putting"" and ""like a villain in a Karate Kid movie."" ""There is a type of politician - you have a few of them here in the United States and they had a lot in and around Brexit and we have Mr. Poilievre in Canada - a type of politician who tend to be lifelong politician, really tend to worship the market but they've never actually worked in the private sector,"" said Carney. ""And they see opportunity in tragedy, like you just had with the fires, these horrible fires, and they see opportunity in tragedy to push an agenda ...,"" said Carney, who accused Poilievre of wanting to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to cut taxes and government workers. Carney also told Stewart that the Liberal leadership race was short on candidates because so many cabinet ministers believe they have to focus on the ""crisis"" caused by the threat of tariffs being imposed on Canadian goods, rather than party politics or personal ambition. By not being part of the government, Carney argued he was better positioned to run for Trudeau's job. ""Wild hypothetical. Let's say the candidate wasn't part of the government. Let's say the candidate did have a lot of economic experience. Let's say the candidate did deal with prices. Let's say the candidate had a plan to deal with the challenges in the here and now,"" said Carney. ""You sneaky ... you're running as an outsider,"" said Stewart. ""I am an outsider,"" said Carney. The Conservatives pushed back on Carney's characterization of himself, saying he is the ""furthest thing possible from an outsider,"" after being a longtime Liberal ""insider, adviser"" and the chair of the party's economic growth task force. Carney also criticized Trudeau's government for taking its eye off the ball while inflation soared and housing became unaffordable.

"Harper unloads on Trudeau, Trump",2025.0,"In his most explicit critique of his successor to date, former prime minister Stephen Harper said the government of Justin Trudeau has failed on basically every possible metric and has ""denigrated"" the country. ""All of the results of that government are bad; I mean virtually everything has been bad,"" Harper told Florida-based podcaster Gabe Groisman this week. On economics, Harper said ""the damage is undeniable,"" and he also accused Trudeau of pursuing a ""woke agenda that has really denigrated the country's culture and history and institutions."" ""I think Canadians have reacted more strongly against that than even the economic results,"" Harper said. Harper has made fewer than half-a-dozen media appearances since stepping down as prime minister in 2015 - almost all of them on U.S. conservative podcasts. In 2018, Harper sat down for an hour with American conservative broadcaster Ben Shapiro. In 2021, he was a featured guest on the podcast American Optimist hosted by tech investor Joe Lonsdale (who had hired Harper as a consultant). In both of those, Harper delivered only veiled criticisms of the Trudeau government, saying he made it a point to avoid weighing in on the actions of his ""successor government."" In Harper's 2021 interview with Lonsdale, he said only that Canada's procurement of COVID-19 vaccines would have happened much earlier under a Conservative government. ""When we were in government, we never had any problem making sure we had vaccines well in advance,"" he said. Even in a 2023 keynote appearance at the Canada Strong & Free Conference, Harper's only real critique of the Trudeau government was to say that it was on a ""pretty poor course."" But Harper's interview with Groisman was different. Right off the top, he accused Trudeau of misrepresenting himself as a centrist in the 2015 election that ousted Harper from power. ""He didn't run as a far leftist; (he) tried to convince everybody that all the things they liked about our government would be maintained and a few things would be changed,"" Harper said, adding ""of course, the government then went to the far left almost immediately."" He said Trudeau was never a particularly skilled politician, but clung to power owing to a ""media conglomerate"" that ""erased his every error"" and ""misrepresented his opposition."" ""It was literally propaganda ... and that's not going to be good enough anymore,"" he said. When Groisman asked whether Trudeau's downfall was a symptom of a global populist shift against leftwing incumbents, Harper said Canadians were turning on Trudeau for very specific reasons, rather than any kind of generalized distaste for progressivism. Harper expressed his belief that ""governments defeat themselves,"" and that Trudeau had brought ""totally dysfunctional government"" to Canada. ""It isn't just the economy, it isn't just the anti-Canadian culture, but it's also just that Canadian public services are not functioning properly,"" he said. While Harper gave credit to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre for leading the charge against the Liberal government, he added ""Trudeau largely did it to himself."" Harper also speculated on how the next few months would play out. He predicted the new Liberal leader would be prime minister for ""only a few weeks"" before being forced to call an election that the party is virtually guaranteed to lose. A Liberal victory ""would require a miracle on their part, and some kind of disaster on (the Conservatives') part,"" he said. Harper said Trudeau's successor would be faced with the ""Kamala Harris problem"" - but worse. Harris, of course, was the Democratic nominee for U.S. president who attempted to run as a ""change"" candidate despite being an incumbent member of the Biden administration. Instead, voters picked her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump. The next Liberal leader will have to go through a leadership race that will see them affirm their loyalty to the party and the record of the current government, only to immediately turn around and face an electorate that is unsatisfied with the status quo. ""The person's in an impossible situation,"" said Harper. The interview also featured Harper being critical of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. Specifically, Trump's repeated public threats to annex Canada as the ""51st state."" At the start of the interview, Groisman framed Trump's bluster as being a bid to destabilize the Canadian government and renegotiate the U.S. trade relationship with its northern neighbour from a ""position of strength."" Harper was far less sanguine, saying Trump was wildly misrepresenting one of the United States'closest friends and ""shared comrade in the propagation of the values of the free and democratic world everywhere."" ""I must admit to being shocked by some of the things that (Trump) said; they're just not so,"" said Harper. He focused in particular on Trump's frequent claim that Canada's trade surplus with the U.S. represents a subsidy. Harper said the surplus exists because of large quantities of Canadian oil purchased by the U.S. at a significant discount due to Canada's lack of alternative export options. ""It's actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard,"" said Harper. On the issue of border security, Harper said there's no real migrant crisis on the U.S. northern border, and that far more ""guns, drugs, crime"" were entering Canada from the other direction. He also expressed bafflement with the notion that Canada needs to step up its defence of the North American continent. Harper said the U.S. participates in alliances such as Norad to ensure the ""defence of the United States."" ""Do you want Canada to be a neutral country?"" he said. ""I have a real problem with a lot of the things that Donald Trump is saying; it doesn't sound to me like the pronouncements of somebody who's a friend, a partner and an ally,"" he said.

It is not a thing of the past,"" said Jeremy Ghio, a former political staffer to Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a director at the communication firm Tact in Montreal. Earlier on Tuesday, a source close to Government House Leader Karina Gould said she plans to launch her campaign to become the next leader this week. Prospective candidates have until Jan. 23 to register to run and until Jan. 27 to sign up new members. The winner will be announced on March 9. The tight constraints of the race, which includes the requirement to raise $350,000, has meant other potential successors to Trudeau have bowed out. Gould, who was first elected in 2015, would be the youngest candidate in the race at 37 and the only Millennial. Other expected contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank governor Mark Carney and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Gould serves as the government's House Leader and before that was the minister responsible for shepherding the signing of national child care deals with provinces and territories.

"Harper unloads on Trudeau, Trump",2025.0,"In his most explicit critique of his successor to date, former prime minister Stephen Harper said the government of Justin Trudeau has failed on basically every possible metric and has ""denigrated"" the country. ""All of the results of that government are bad; I mean virtually everything has been bad,"" Harper told Florida-based podcaster Gabe Groisman this week. On economics, Harper said ""the damage is undeniable,"" and he also accused Trudeau of pursuing a ""woke agenda that has really denigrated the country's culture and history and institutions."" ""I think Canadians have reacted more strongly against that than even the economic results,"" Harper said. Harper has made fewer than half-a-dozen media appearances since stepping down as prime minister in 2015 - almost all of them on U.S. conservative podcasts. In 2018, Harper sat down for an hour with American conservative broadcaster Ben Shapiro. In 2021, he was a featured guest on the podcast American Optimist hosted by tech investor Joe Lonsdale (who had hired Harper as a consultant). In both of those, Harper delivered only veiled criticisms of the Trudeau government, saying he made it a point to avoid weighing in on the actions of his ""successor government."" In Harper's 2021 interview with Lonsdale, he said only that Canada's procurement of COVID-19 vaccines would have happened much earlier under a Conservative government. ""When we were in government, we never had any problem making sure we had vaccines well in advance,"" he said. Even in a 2023 keynote appearance at the Canada Strong & Free Conference, Harper's only real critique of the Trudeau government was to say that it was on a ""pretty poor course."" But Harper's interview with Groisman was different. Right off the top, he accused Trudeau of misrepresenting himself as a centrist in the 2015 election that ousted Harper from power. ""He didn't run as a far leftist; (he) tried to convince everybody that all the things they liked about our government would be maintained and a few things would be changed,"" Harper said, adding ""of course, the government then went to the far left almost immediately."" He said Trudeau was never a particularly skilled politician, but clung to power owing to a ""media conglomerate"" that ""erased his every error"" and ""misrepresented his opposition."" ""It was literally propaganda ... and that's not going to be good enough anymore,"" he said. When Groisman asked whether Trudeau's downfall was a symptom of a global populist shift against leftwing incumbents, Harper said Canadians were turning on Trudeau for very specific reasons, rather than any kind of generalized distaste for progressivism. Harper expressed his belief that ""governments defeat themselves,"" and that Trudeau had brought ""totally dysfunctional government"" to Canada. ""It isn't just the economy, it isn't just the anti-Canadian culture, but it's also just that Canadian public services are not functioning properly,"" he said. While Harper gave credit to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre for leading the charge against the Liberal government, he added ""Trudeau largely did it to himself."" Harper also speculated on how the next few months would play out. He predicted the new Liberal leader would be prime minister for ""only a few weeks"" before being forced to call an election that the party is virtually guaranteed to lose. A Liberal victory ""would require a miracle on their part, and some kind of disaster on (the Conservatives') part,"" he said. Harper said Trudeau's successor would be faced with the ""Kamala Harris problem"" - but worse. Harris, of course, was the Democratic nominee for U.S. president who attempted to run as a ""change"" candidate despite being an incumbent member of the Biden administration. Instead, voters picked her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump. The next Liberal leader will have to go through a leadership race that will see them affirm their loyalty to the party and the record of the current government, only to immediately turn around and face an electorate that is unsatisfied with the status quo. ""The person's in an impossible situation,"" said Harper. The interview also featured Harper being critical of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. Specifically, Trump's repeated public threats to annex Canada as the ""51st state."" At the start of the interview, Groisman framed Trump's bluster as being a bid to destabilize the Canadian government and renegotiate the U.S. trade relationship with its northern neighbour from a ""position of strength."" Harper was far less sanguine, saying Trump was wildly misrepresenting one of the United States'closest friends and ""shared comrade in the propagation of the values of the free and democratic world everywhere."" ""I must admit to being shocked by some of the things that (Trump) said; they're just not so,"" said Harper. He focused in particular on Trump's frequent claim that Canada's trade surplus with the U.S. represents a subsidy. Harper said the surplus exists because of large quantities of Canadian oil purchased by the U.S. at a significant discount due to Canada's lack of alternative export options. ""It's actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard,"" said Harper. On the issue of border security, Harper said there's no real migrant crisis on the U.S. northern border, and that far more ""guns, drugs, crime"" were entering Canada from the other direction. He also expressed bafflement with the notion that Canada needs to step up its defence of the North American continent. Harper said the U.S. participates in alliances such as Norad to ensure the ""defence of the United States."" ""Do you want Canada to be a neutral country?"" he said. ""I have a real problem with a lot of the things that Donald Trump is saying; it doesn't sound to me like the pronouncements of somebody who's a friend, a partner and an ally,"" he said.

Texas man charged with stalking WNBA star Clark,2025.0,"Authorities in Indianapolis have charged a 55-year-old Texas man with felony stalking of Indiana Fever star and WNBA rookie of the year Caitlin Clark. Michael Thomas Lewis is accused of repeated and continued harassment of Clark, 22, beginning Dec. 16, the Marion County prosecutor's office wrote in a court filing. Lewis posted numerous messages on Clark's X account, according to an affidavit from a Marion County sheriff's lieutenant. In one, he said he had been driving by the Gainbridge Fieldhouse - one of the arenas where the Fever plays home games - three times day, and in another he said he had ""one foot on a banana peel and the other on a stalking charge."" Other messages directed at Clark were sexually explicit. The posts ""actually caused Caitlin Clark to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened"" and an implicit or explicit threat also was made ""with the intent to place Caitlin Clark in reasonable fear of sexual battery,"" prosecutors wrote in the court filing. The FBI learned the X account belonged to Lewis and the messages were sent from IP addresses associated with an Indianapolis hotel and downtown public library. Indianapolis police spoke with Lewis on Jan. 8 at his hotel room. He told officers he was in Indianapolis on vacation. Mounties in Lloydminster have laid charges in the case of an Alberta minor hockey association that was defrauded of hundreds of thousands of dollars. RCMP say they were told in September that money was being embezzled from the Lloydminster Minor Hockey Association. Police say more than $300,000 was taken through fraud and theft over a five-year period. A 42-year-old man from Lloydminster has been charged with several counts, including fraud and theft over $5,000. In a letter to members, the general manager of the association says its former operations chairman has been charged. - With files from The Associated Press and The Canadian Press","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 15, 2025",Criminal investigations; Stalking,Nom: Womens National Basketball Association; NAICS: 813990,2025-01-15,The Ottawa Citizen
"Carney rips Poilievre, teases run for Liberals; Late-Night Tv",2025.0,"Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney used an interview on U.S. late-night television to attack Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and make his case for the Liberal leadership. In an interview with The Daily Show host Jon Stewart Monday night, Carney didn't definitively say he would seek to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but he did say that a ""hypothetical"" outsider candidate was better positioned to run for the job while U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on Canadian goods. The National Post reported last week that Carney is likely to launch his campaign this week. Carney wasn't shy about attacking Poilie vre after Stewart said Poilievre seemed ""very off-putting"" and ""like a villain in a Karate Kid movie."" ""There is a type of politician - you have a few of them here in the United States and they had a lot in and around Brexit and we have Mr. Poilievre in Canada - a type of politician who tend to be lifelong politician, really tend to worship the market but they've never actually worked in the private sector,"" said Carney. ""And they see opportunity in tragedy, like you just had with the fires, these horrible fires, and they see opportunity in tragedy to push an agenda ...,"" said Carney, who accused Poilievre of wanting to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to cut taxes and government workers. Carney also told Stewart that the Liberal leadership race was short on candidates because so many cabinet ministers believe they have to focus on the ""crisis"" caused by the threat of tariffs being imposed on Canadian goods, rather than party politics or personal ambition. By not being part of the government, Carney argued he was better positioned to run for Trudeau's job. ""Wild hypothetical. Let's say the candidate wasn't part of the government. Let's say the candidate did have a lot of economic experience. Let's say the candidate did deal with prices. Let's say the candidate had a plan to deal with the challenges in the here and now,"" said Carney. ""You sneaky ... you're running as an outsider,"" said Stewart. ""I am an outsider,"" said Carney. The Conservatives pushed back on Carney's characterization of himself, saying he is the ""furthest thing possible from an outsider,"" after being a longtime Liberal ""insider, adviser"" and the chair of the party's economic growth task force. Carney also criticized Trudeau's government for taking its eye off the ball while inflation soared and housing became unaffordable.

"Clark, Champagne take a pass; High-profile potential liberal leader candidates bow out, house leader gould expected to Jump In",2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne both announced on Tuesday they won't run to become leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Meanwhile, Liberal House leader Karina Gould is expected to launch her leadership campaign later this week. Clark, who was one of the most prominent potential candidates, announced to supporters Tuesday morning that ""there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language."" ""I have worked hard at improving my French, but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she wrote in an email to supporters. Many prominent Liberals, including Champagne, have said the next leader must speak French and understand Quebec. In that email, Clark wrote that despite the fact she has been able to assemble a team of ""hundreds"" of organizers from across the country, she has ""made the difficult decision to step back."" She broke the news over a Zoom call with about 40 organizers roughly 20 minutes before her news went public. Clark's decision comes after she claimed to have misspoken to the CBC Radio show The House when she repeatedly denied ever having been a member of the federal Conservative party and voting in its 2022 leadership race, despite having declared so in previous speeches and media interviews. Clark didn't mention the CBC interview in her email to supporters and instead pointed to the short time frame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left for prospective contenders, given his decision to announce on Jan. 6 he was stepping down. ""The timing of the prime minister's resignation just did not leave enough time for the party to build a process that will renew and grow our party,"" said Clark. ""Our party must still find a way to generate new momentum and energy. To open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" Hours later, Champagne told a group of Toronto business people that he would not run to become Canada's next prime minister. ""I thought about it carefully. I came to the conclusion that I will not be seeking the leadership in this race. It was probably the most difficult decision in my life, but I think it is the right one at this time,"" Champagne told journalist Amanda Lang at the Canadian Club. That means no francophones or prominent Quebec candidates will run to succeed Trudeau, himself a Quebecer. Champagne was considered the Quebec Liberals'last great hope in the race, and he was seriously considering running. The historical tradition of alternating between an anglophone and a francophone leader at the head of the party will prevail. ""There is no message to Quebecers here.

Other expected contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank governor Mark Carney and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland.

"Liberal race loses more big names; Champagne, Clark bow out, Gould is in, Carney is",2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne both announced on Tuesday they won't run to become leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Meanwhile, Liberal House leader Karina Gould is expected to launch her campaign later this week. Clark, who was one of the most prominent potential candidates, announced to supporters Tuesday morning that ""there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language."" ""I have worked hard at improving my French, but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she wrote in an email sent to supporters. Many prominent Liberals, including Champagne, recently said the next leader must speak French and understand Quebec. In her email, Clark wrote that, despite the fact she has been able to assemble a team of ""hundreds"" from across the country, she has ""made the difficult decision to step back."" She first broke it to them over a Zoom call with about 40 organizers roughly 20 minutes before her news went public. She spent months laying the groundwork for a potential bid before dropping out. As late as Sunday evening, she was sending emails to supporters and meeting with organizers. Clark's decision comes just days after she claimed to have misspoken to the CBC Radio show The House, when she repeatedly denied ever having been a member of the federal Conservative party and voting in its 2022 leadership race, despite having declared so in previous speeches and media interviews. Clark didn't mention the CBC interview, which aired on the weekend, in her email to supporters and instead pointed to the short time frame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left for prospective contenders. ""The timing of the prime minister's resignation just did not leave enough time for the party to build a process that will renew and grow our party,"" Clark said. ""Our party must still find a way to generate new momentum and energy. To open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" Hours later, Champagne told a group of Toronto business people that he would not run to become the next prime minister. ""I thought about it carefully. I came to the conclusion that I will not be seeking the leadership in this race. It was probably the most difficult decision in my life, but I think it is the right one at this time,"" Champagne told journalist Amanda Lang at the Canadian Club. That means no francophones or prominent Quebec candidates will run to succeed Trudeau, himself a Quebecer. Champagne was considered the Quebec Liberals'last great hope in the race. Despite his decision, the tradition of alternating between an anglophone and a francophone leader at the head of the party will prevail, said Jeremy Ghio, a former political staffer to Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a director at the communication firm Tact in Montreal ""There is no message to Quebecers here. The only thing we can see in this is that those who hoped that the principle of alternation would be a thing of the past have their answer. It is not a thing of the past,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, a source close to Gould said she plans to launch her leadership campaign this week. Prospective candidates have until Jan. 23 to register to run and until Jan. 27 to sign up new members. The winner will be announced on March 9. Speaking at an unrelated news conference in her Burlington, Ont., riding, Gould declined to confirm her intentions, saying only: ""I'll have more to say in the coming days."" The tight constraints of the race, which includes the requirement to raise $350,000, has meant other potential successors to Trudeau have bowed out of the contest, such as Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon. More prominent cabinet ministers, such as Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, cited the need to dedicate energy to bracing for U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, who is threatening to slap 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods. Gould, who was first elected in 2015, would be the youngest candidate in the race at 37 and the only millennial. She made history as the youngest woman appointed to cabinet and the first minister to take maternity leave. Her plan to enter the race comes amid growing anxieties about the ability for those under 40 to own a home and at a time when many of the young progressives who first voted for Trudeau back in 2015 have turned away from the party. ""I think it is extremely important that we have a younger voice in the race who can relate to people where they are and the struggles that they're facing today,"" she told reporters in Burlington. Other e xpec ted contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, whom one source has said is expected to launch his campaign this week, and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, whose team has not been as definitive on timing. A source close to Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who is in Washington before Trump's inauguration next week, said he is still mulling a potential bid.

""Truth be told, the government has been not as focused on those issues as it could be. We need to focus on them immediately.

"Harper unloads on Trudeau, Trump",2025.0,"In his most explicit critique of his successor to date, former prime minister Stephen Harper said the government of Justin Trudeau has failed on basically every possible metric and has ""denigrated"" the country. ""All of the results of that government are bad; I mean virtually everything has been bad,"" Harper told Florida-based podcaster Gabe Groisman this week. On economics, Harper said ""the damage is undeniable,"" and he also accused Trudeau of pursuing a ""woke agenda that has really denigrated the country's culture and history and institutions."" ""I think Canadians have reacted more strongly against that than even the economic results,"" Harper said. Harper has made fewer than half-a-dozen media appearances since stepping down as prime minister in 2015 - almost all of them on U.S. conservative podcasts. In 2018, Harper sat down for an hour with American conservative broadcaster Ben Shapiro. In 2021, he was a featured guest on the podcast American Optimist hosted by tech investor Joe Lonsdale (who had hired Harper as a consultant). In both of those, Harper delivered only veiled criticisms of the Trudeau government, saying he made it a point to avoid weighing in on the actions of his ""successor government."" In Harper's 2021 interview with Lonsdale, he said only that Canada's procurement of COVID-19 vaccines would have happened much earlier under a Conservative government. ""When we were in government, we never had any problem making sure we had vaccines well in advance,"" he said. Even in a 2023 keynote appearance at the Canada Strong & Free Conference, Harper's only real critique of the Trudeau government was to say that it was on a ""pretty poor course."" But Harper's interview with Groisman was different. Right off the top, he accused Trudeau of misrepresenting himself as a centrist in the 2015 election that ousted Harper from power. ""He didn't run as a far leftist; (he) tried to convince everybody that all the things they liked about our government would be maintained and a few things would be changed,"" Harper said, adding ""of course, the government then went to the far left almost immediately."" He said Trudeau was never a particularly skilled politician, but clung to power owing to a ""media conglomerate"" that ""erased his every error"" and ""misrepresented his opposition."" ""It was literally propaganda ... and that's not going to be good enough anymore,"" he said. When Groisman asked whether Trudeau's downfall was a symptom of a global populist shift against leftwing incumbents, Harper said Canadians were turning on Trudeau for very specific reasons, rather than any kind of generalized distaste for progressivism. Harper expressed his belief that ""governments defeat themselves,"" and that Trudeau had brought ""totally dysfunctional government"" to Canada. ""It isn't just the economy, it isn't just the anti-Canadian culture, but it's also just that Canadian public services are not functioning properly,"" he said. While Harper gave credit to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre for leading the charge against the Liberal government, he added ""Trudeau largely did it to himself."" Harper also speculated on how the next few months would play out. He predicted the new Liberal leader would be prime minister for ""only a few weeks"" before being forced to call an election that the party is virtually guaranteed to lose. A Liberal victory ""would require a miracle on their part, and some kind of disaster on (the Conservatives') part,"" he said. Harper said Trudeau's successor would be faced with the ""Kamala Harris problem"" - but worse. Harris, of course, was the Democratic nominee for U.S. president who attempted to run as a ""change"" candidate despite being an incumbent member of the Biden administration. Instead, voters picked her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump. The next Liberal leader will have to go through a leadership race that will see them affirm their loyalty to the party and the record of the current government, only to immediately turn around and face an electorate that is unsatisfied with the status quo. ""The person's in an impossible situation,"" said Harper. The interview also featured Harper being critical of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. Specifically, Trump's repeated public threats to annex Canada as the ""51st state."" At the start of the interview, Groisman framed Trump's bluster as being a bid to destabilize the Canadian government and renegotiate the U.S. trade relationship with its northern neighbour from a ""position of strength."" Harper was far less sanguine, saying Trump was wildly misrepresenting one of the United States'closest friends and ""shared comrade in the propagation of the values of the free and democratic world everywhere."" ""I must admit to being shocked by some of the things that (Trump) said; they're just not so,"" said Harper. He focused in particular on Trump's frequent claim that Canada's trade surplus with the U.S. represents a subsidy. Harper said the surplus exists because of large quantities of Canadian oil purchased by the U.S. at a significant discount due to Canada's lack of alternative export options. ""It's actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard,"" said Harper. On the issue of border security, Harper said there's no real migrant crisis on the U.S. northern border, and that far more ""guns, drugs, crime"" were entering Canada from the other direction. He also expressed bafflement with the notion that Canada needs to step up its defence of the North American continent. Harper said the U.S. participates in alliances such as Norad to ensure the ""defence of the United States."" ""Do you want Canada to be a neutral country?"" he said. ""I have a real problem with a lot of the things that Donald Trump is saying; it doesn't sound to me like the pronouncements of somebody who's a friend, a partner and an ally,"" he said.

Federal Tories nominate former PC cabinet minister Morley-Lecomte to challenge Duguid in Winnipeg South,2025.0,"FORMER Tory MLA and cabinet minister Janice Morley-Lecomte will be facing off against the country’s sports minister in the upcoming federal election. Morley-Lecomte, who was mental health and community wellness minister for nine months in former premier Heather Stefanson’s government before losing her Seine River seat in the last election, has been chosen to run for the Conservative party in the Winnipeg South riding. The riding has been held by Liberal MP Terry Duguid, who was recently appointed sports minister, as well as the minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada since 2015. “(She) was part of the Conservative government which was shown the door in late 2023, just a little more than a year ago,” Duguid said Tuesday. “I think Manitobans recall very vividly that the Conservatives brought major cuts to our health-care system that is still recovering from the devastation that they brought. “They closed the Victoria Hospital emergency ward, right in the heart of Winnipeg South.” No one from the Conservative Party of Canada or the Winnipeg South Conservative Association could be reached for comment. Winnipeg South is one of seven of Manitoba’s 14 ridings in which at least two of the three major parties have nominated candidates for election, which must be held on or before Oct. 20. Both Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh have vowed to vote down the minority Liberal government at the first opportunity, which will be in late March when Parliament reopens. A Manitoba political scientist said the three major parties still have many ridings to fill with candidates for an election that could be just weeks away. “Is it an intentional tactic to keep them under the radar to avoid scrutiny?” Kelly Saunders, an associate political science professor at Brandon University, asked Tuesday. “Is it to prevent the media from profiling them and look at their past social media posts or statements they have made in the past? Or is it they are a little disorganized and not putting out effective notices? “It’s not like we didn’t know an election was coming in 2025.” The Liberal party in Manitoba, which many pundits say will be in a tough slog to see their candidates elected or re-elected in the four Winnipeg ridings they currently hold, appear to have the most candidates officially nominated at six, all in Winnipeg ridings. Along with Duguid, they include MPs Kevin Lamoureaux (Winnipeg North) and Ben Carr (Winnipeg South Centre), as well as candidates Ian MacIntyre (Elmwood-Transcona), Rahul Walia (Winnipeg Centre) and former MP Doug Eyolfson (Winnipeg West). No candidate has been chosen in Saint Boniface-Saint Vital, where Liberal MP and cabinet minister Dan Vandal announced last year he was not going to be running again. Looking at local party riding websites, the Conservatives have three candidates nominated — Morley-Lecomte, Ted Falk (Provencher) and Royden Brousseau (Winnipeg South Centre). The NDP have just one candidate nominated, Ellen Clark in Kildonan-St. Paul, which Tory MP Raquel Dancho currently represents. Saunders said the parties should already have chosen their slates of candidates. “They owe it to the voters,” she said. “I would have hoped the parties would be much more organized and much more public and transparent.” But Duguid, who is also co-chair of the Liberal national campaign, and who was nominated in his own riding two years ago, said it is not unusual for parties to nominate candidates in the run-up to an election. “We will have some more names for you in a few weeks,” he said, noting Saint Boniface-Saint Vital should be next to announce a candidate. “Because we’ve had a minority government, the timing of an election was very uncertain … I think all parties are picking up the pace. “When the threat of an election is in the air, then all parties pick up the pace.” kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Kevin Rollason","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Rollason, Kevin",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 15, 2025",Conservatism; Nominations; Candidates; Elections; Political parties,,2025-01-15,Winnipeg Free Press

Who sets the agenda if Poilievre wins?,2025.0,"What nickname will Donald Trump bestow on Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, a politician who shares the U.S. president-elect's great love of the schoolyard taunt? ""Governor,"" needless to say, has been taken. Maybe Mr. Pete? Pierre Poutine? Or some flagrant mispronunciation of Poilievre (my bet)? One thing's for certain: there will be a moniker and it won't be flattering. I raise this point because Trump and his bellicose threats are likely to become Poilievre's headache at some point in the next several months, and we are seeing, in real time, how that highly fluid dynamic is playing out. If Poilievre believed he'll somehow be able to make common cause with Trump because of their shared right-wing populism, the events of the past week should disabuse him of the assumption that they'll be easy allies. After Trump's stream-of-consciousness press conference at Mar-a-Lago - during which he threatened military force against Greenland and Panama and ""economic force"" against Canada - our political leaders reacted quickly, upping the rhetorical ante after spending weeks publicly shrugging off his ""51st state"" trolling as mere joking. First came Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, then Justin Trudeau (""not a snowball's chance""), NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, offering to buy Alaska and Minnesota on Fox. Then, Poilievre issued a statement via X, his first direct response. ""Canada,"" he began, ""will never be the 51st state. Period."" Poilievre, of course, had no choice, given that Trump's rhetoric is now clearly much more than just a punchline and that public opinion polls show how massively disapproving Canadians are at the prospect of being annexed. But by so doing, Poilievre has situated himself in opposition to the guy he'll likely be negotiating against later this year. Which means the Tory leader will get a demeaning nickname and find himself, as the future prime minister, in precisely the same unstable position against an antagonistic U.S. administration as his loathed predecessor. Ever since Trump won the election in November, Poilievre has publicly behaved as if nothing has changed. In his lengthy interview with Jordan Peterson, recorded just before Christmas and released a couple weeks later, Poilievre never once mentioned Trump's across-the-board tariff threat. His priorities, he told the former professor-turned-culture warrior, are all the talking points we know well: ""axing the tax,"" building homes, cutting the federal deficit, etc. He prattled on about corporate Canada's ""idiot lobbyists"" and claimed, all evidence to the contrary, that homebuilders haven't been complaining sufficiently about the municipal fees that, he says, drive up house prices. Yet whatever Poilievre may think he wants to achieve once he takes office will necessarily take a back seat to the single most pressing and all-consuming economic crisis Canada has faced in generations, if ever. Trump may have another agenda or end point in mind, but the fact is that he regards hefty tariffs as a potent source of leverage, and there's no reason to believe the presence of a conservative in the Prime Minister's Office will have any impact on his determination to wield that power. I'd guess that Trump, with his knack for spotting weakness in counterparties, recognizes that Poilievre's 'Canada is broken' rhetoric and his assumptions about the benefits of their ideological kinship is, in and of itself, a weakness to be exploited. Once asked what knocks governments off course, former British prime minister Harold MacMillan famously replied, ""Events, dear boy, events."" So it will be with Poilievre, who, despite what could be a large majority and a clear mandate, simply won't have the luxury of choosing his own agenda from the very moment he takes office. Instead of mindlessly repeating slogans and lacing his rhetoric with adolescent put-downs, Poilievre will actually have to govern on behalf of all Canadians, which means responding to an externally imposed crisis in ways that go far beyond hyperpartisan calculation. As Susan Delacourt pointed out on the weekend, he'll have to grow up, and do so at an extraordinarily pressurized juncture. We've seen this occur before. When Jean Chrétien's Liberals took office in 1993, they immediately had to face the harsh reality that the federal government was hurtling toward a fiscal brick wall. And it happened again in late 2008, when Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper realized he had to abandon fiscal austerity in response to a global credit crisis that threatened to bring the Canadian economy to a standstill. Both were far more seasoned leaders than Poilievre, who has never run anything more complex than the Office of the Leader of the Official Opposition. Yet reality will bite him, too, and then we'll all learn what, if anything, lies behind that snug T-shirt and all the name-calling.

Campbell River buys hotel and additional lots for downtown revitalization project,2025.0,"Times Colonist The City of Campbell River has bought four properties in its downtown core, including a 60-year-old hotel, for a downtown revitalization project that would include rental housing. The city plans to seek a private-sector partner to build the waterfront-area project on Shoppers Row, which would include approximately 200 rental units, ranging from studio to three-bedrooms, above groundlevel commercial, retail and civic spaces. The 1965-built Harbourside Inn, purchased by the city on Dec. 20, 2024 for $8 million, according to government records, is expected to be demolished, with plans for construction to begin next year. Low-income tenants of the approximately 60-room hotel, which offers long-term rentals, along with a community kitchen and drop-in centre, will be displaced when demolition starts on the hotel this year. The city said it is working with the province and other agencies to find new homes for the renters. The vacancy rate, however, is below one per cent. The initiative is seen as a way to boost the economy in the city, which according to the 2021 census had a population of 38,000. Tenders have not yet been issued for a partner. ""Council has a vision for the downtown. We are reimagining Shoppers Row and bringing back the vibrancy and strong character that Campbell River is known for,"" Mayor Kermit Dahl said in a statement. Dahl said the development will ""animate the area, increase livability and walkability, and deliver on council's commitment to downtown revitalization and community safety."" The prospect of downtown improvements delights the commercial sector. ""I personally am ecstatic, as most people are in the business community,"" said Jan Wade, executive director of the Downtown Campbell River Business Improvement Association. She said she's already heard from business people who want to rent space in the development. There's a strong demand for commercial space in the city's downtown, Wade said. ""We have people moving from out of town to open a business and we have people moving from other areas of Campbell River to set up downtown."" Mary Ruth Snyder, executive director at the Campbell River Chamber of Commerce, is also enthusiastic, saying the project has been discussed for years. ""The fact that this mayor and council have found a solution is spectacular."" Higher density will increase the vibrancy of downtown, she said. The city said the Shoppers Row area was selected because of its potential for economic growth, infrastructure and central importance to the community. ""It is our hope that revitalizing this space will have positive ripple effects on surrounding neighborhoods,"" it said. The city bought 1302 Shoppers Row, home to the downtown safety office, in 2023. Last year, it purchased a vacant lot at 1352 Shoppers Row and 1362 16th Ave., which has a commercial building. The four lots total about 1.4 hectares. The new building is intended to house the Downtown Safety Centre and serve as a base for the bylaw office to carry out its downtown patrols and clean-up work, the city said. Campbell River acquired the properties in the 1300-block of Shoppers Row for $10.6 million, using part of a $10.4 million contribution from the federal housing accelerator fund, the city said in a statement. Such grants and city reserve funds ""will also be used to advance this project with no direct impact to taxation,"" it said. Jim Creighton, who used to manage events at the the city's Spirit Square, said the Harbourside Inn's condition has deteriorated in the past few years and it would make sense to redevelop it, although he's concerned about where tenants will go. City manager Elle Brovold said the city is working with community partners and B.C. Housing to relocate tenants in coming months. Kwesa Place, which provides a place to shower and clean clothes, and the community kitchen are part of the Laichwiltach Family Life Society. Laura McLeod, B.C. Housing spokesperson, said that agency has not been funding units at the Harbourside Inn, but is ""in discussions with the City of Campbell River to understand what support the tenants may need to relocate to a new home as a result of the city's redevelopment plans."" Since 2017, B.C. Housing has provided 319 units of affordable housing in Campbell River, McLeod said. Most have tenants and another 98 units are planned. A 40-unit temporary supportive housing facility recently opened. Joanne Watson, executive director of the Campbell River Food Bank and lead at the community kitchen - which receives a large portion of its food from the food bank - said the group has been told the kitchen must move out by June. Many seniors, some with mobility issues, who live in the inn rely on the kitchen for hot meals, she said, noting it provides an average of about 70 to 80 meals per night. Watson said she is hopeful that another location will be found for the community kitchen. cjwilson@timescolonist.com","Times - Colonist; Victoria, B.C.","Victoria, B.C.","Wilson, Carla",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 11, 2025",Food programs; Councils; Rentals; Tenants,,2025-01-11,Times - Colonist

Campbell returns to Redblacks as special teams co-ordinator; Former head coach led Ottawa to three Grey Cup appearances in six seasons,2025.0,"Rick Campbell is back in red and black. The Ottawa Redblacks announced Thursday morning that Campbell, their first head coach, has returned to the capital as the CFL club's special teams co-ordinator. Campbell, 54, guided Ottawa to three Grey Cups in his six seasons (2014-19) as the sideline boss, including its championship win in 2016. For the past four years, he has served as head coach and co-general manager of the B.C. Lions, who fired him after last season's 9-9 finish. To borrow the title of a Justin Timberlake song, What Goes Around Comes Around. In 2016, Campbell hired Bob Dyce as the Redblacks'special teams co-ordinator. Nine years later, Dyce, now Ottawa's head coach, has returned the favour. ""Throughout our time working together, and coaching against each other, Rick has demonstrated what it means to be a leader of men,"" Dyce said Thursday. ""His experience coaching all phases of the game will be a tremendous asset to our football club and we're extremely pleased to welcome him back to Ottawa."" The position became vacant last week when Cory McDiarmid made a lateral move for the same job with the Lions. Before the Redblacks announced they had hired Will Fields as their defensive co-ordinator last week, there was speculation that Campbell would be a good fit in that role, which he previously had in Calgary and Edmonton. But insiders felt that Campbell was going to take the upcoming CFL season to catch his breath and evaluate his options. Clearly, he didn't want to step away from the game. ""It feels like coming home,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""Ottawa is a special place, and I'm looking forward to getting to work and competing for the Grey Cup in 2025."" Campbell is the son of the legendary Hugh Campbell, who coached the Edmonton Eskimos to five consecutive Grey Cup wins from 1978-82. Rick Campbell was a graduate assistant at Oregon before taking his first CFL job in Edmonton as a defensive backs coach and special teams co-ordinator from 1999-2004, when he picked up his first of three Grey Cup rings in 2003. He was promoted to defensive co-ordinator in 2004, and after four seasons became the Winnipeg Blue Bombers'DB coach/special teams co-ordinator for one year. From there, he was the Stampeders running backs coach in 2010, Edmonton's assistant head coach/special teams co-ordinator in 2011 and Calgary's defensive co-ordinator in 2012 and 2013. Campbell's record as the Redblacks head coach is 44-62-2, but it does include the team's inaugural 2-16 season and a 3-15 mark in 2019. dbrennan@postmedia.com","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.","Brennan, Don",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 10, 2025",,,2025-01-10,The Ottawa Citizen
Legal woes mount amid collapse of former child actor’s property empire:   Investigators have been interviewing people who loaned money to companies controlled by Robby Clark and his mortgage broker,2025.0,"THE LISTING Legal challenges continue to mount for associates of a child actor who bought hundreds of homes across Ontario using more than $144-million in private mortgage debt and risky promissory notes before crashing into insolvency one year ago. In addition to mounting claims in civil court, The Globe and Mail has learned a team of investigators of the Ontario Provincial Police Anti-Rackets Branch has for weeks now been interviewing lenders and investors who lent money to companies controlled by Robby Clark and his primary mortgage broker and promissory note vendor Claire Drage. Several lenders who spoke to The Globe said the OPP probe is seeking documents and information related to allegations of potential criminal fraud raised in civil court filings. None of the allegations have been proven in court. On Jan. 23, 2024, a collection of companies connected to Mr. Clark filed for insolvency protection to reorganize a rental property portfolio of more than 400 homes spread mainly across the Northern Ontario cities of Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins. After a year of legal wrangling, as of December, 2024, the majority of those properties have been transferred out of Clark’s companies to the private mortgage lenders who were allowed to convert the money owed to them to purchases in a credit bid process approved by Ontario Superior Court. “The OPP Anti-Rackets Branch has an ongoing and active investigation,” said Gosia Puzio, with the OPP corporate communications bureau. “Further information cannot be provided at this time to protect the integrity of the investigation and any possible future court proceedings.” On Dec. 20, a court-ordered stay of proceedings that had shielded Mr. Clark and several colleagues – including his wife Aruba Butt, business partner Dylan Suitor and long-time friend Ryan Maloney – from further civil claims was lifted by the court. Ms. Drage, who had not been covered by the stay of proceedings but whose companies filed for a separate bankruptcy in April, 2024, is also facing more than $250-million in civil damages claims from two separate lawsuits, one of which accuses her of running “a fraudulent Ponzi scheme” and the mortgage brokerage company that formerly employed her – Mortgage Alliance Company of Canada Inc. – of negligence, breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. “It’s a multiplaintiff claim, we represent at last count 436 individuals,” said David Milosevic, of Milosevic & Associates, who is representing many of the lenders who were stung by the collapse of Mr. Clark and Ms. Drage’s businesses. “We do a lot of multiparty investment loss cases. … We put out the word we were interested in the file and hundreds of people dove in.” Mortgage Alliance is both provincially and federally regulated financial services company and the largest arm of Montrealbased privately held M3 Financial Group. M3 claims to have $65-billion in funded loans and more than 8,500 mortgage brokers across Canada. “Mortgage Alliance failed to supervise brokers, including Claire Drage, authorized to deal or trade in mortgages on its behalf, allowed the brokers to engage in fraudulent and dishonest conduct, and profited from such conduct,” the claim states. “Generally mortgage investment scams – and we’ve worked on a number of them – always involve an intermediary between the lender and the borrower who failed to administer the mortgages the way the paper says,” said Paul Bates, a lawyer working with Mr. Milosevic, who stressed he wasn’t drawing conclusions about what happened in this case. “They mingle funds, they are always spinning the plates and trying to keep the balls in the air. To the investor, it looks like a safe and sound investment, but the monies aren’t being used the way the paper says.” An unusual court-ordered investigation into the conduct of Mr. Clark’s companies carried out by the insolvency experts at KSV Consulting Inc. found examples of millions of dollars borrowed from lenders that were transferred from the insolvent companies with little or no accounting, lavish spending on corporate travel, entertaining or gifts and in some cases allegations that funds borrowed by Ms. Drage were used not for real estate investing but simply to pay overdue interest to other lenders. Mr. Milosevic’s claim describes how for each of the hundreds of private mortgages Ms. Drage arranged for Mr. Clark’s development companies “fees were sent directly to Mortgages Alliance” which then “transferred the fees to Drage (or her companies), less 5 per cent, which Mortgage Alliance withheld as its own profit.” According to the claim, Ms. Drage’s company Windrose was so closely tied to Mortgage Alliance that it didn’t have its own corporate bank account until 2022 – more than three years after the lending spree with Mr. Clark began – and “relied solely on Mortgage Alliance to handle its funds.” Natalie Leon, partner with Forbes, Chochla and Leon LLP, is defending Mortgage Alliance against the Milosevic action said in an e-mailed statement that “Mortgage Alliance denies any responsibility for the investors’ losses and is now defending those claims in court.” Ms. Leon did offer further context for claims relating to promissory note loans that Ms. Drage arranged, which are not regulated under Ontario’s Mortgage Brokerages, Lenders and Administrators Act, but rather under Canadian securities laws which falls to the Ontario Securities Commission in this case. “Mortgage Alliance is aware of certain claims being made by some investors associated with Claire Drage and her independent business known as Lion’s Share,” Ms. Leon’s statement reads. “The investors were apparently attracted to potential profits through high-interest, highrisk lending schemes not related to Mortgage Alliance that ultimately were unsuccessful. Some of those investors are now looking to others not involved in those affairs to shift their losses.” A separate civil case brought against Mortgage Alliance by Simon Bieber of Adair Goldblatt Bieber LLP alleges many of the same facts and represents approximately 150 plaintiffs seeking more than $100-million in damages. According to Mr. Milosevic, evidence turned up in a securities or criminal fraud investigation or trial could add to the case for his clients, but he isn’t waiting for the police to finish their work. “Unfortunately, the OSC is overwhelmed; our criminal prosecution system is overwhelmed,” he said. “I do fraud cases for a living. I have on average 40 people who call me a week; they are losing their homes. It’s an absolute epidemic and the police can’t do anything about it. I’m not pointing fingers or laying blame, it is just rampant victimization of Canadians and it’s terrible.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Dingman, Shane",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 10, 2025",Mortgages; Insolvency; Stock brokers; Criminal investigations; Breach of contract; Investors; Fraud,,2025-01-10,The Globe and Mail

Former colleagues say Clark is ready for federal Liberal leadership race,2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark has been preparing for months to take a run at being the next federal Liberal leader and could announce her intentions any day now, former colleagues say. They believe that her outsider status as well as her past history of uniting a fractured caucus may give her a legitimate shot at becoming Canada's next prime minister after Justin Trudeau announced his intention to resign Monday. Most polls have Clark falling behind already established cabinet ministers such as ex-finance minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Transportation Minister Anita Anand, and Innovation and Science and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne. Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney has also been much-touted as an outsider candidate, while current Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc was viewed as a potential front-runner until he announced Tuesday he wouldn't be putting his name forward. ""I think she certainly has the potential to be a dark horse in the race,"" said Stephen Smart, general manager of Hill & Knowlton Western Canada and a former press secretary to Clark. ""I really think those who might dismiss her in this race out of the gate really do so at their own peril. She builds great teams around her."" ""She has the potential to really get people on board. She has been a member of the Liberal Party of Canada for a very long time."" While remembered in her home province as the leader of a party, the B.C. Liberals, that represented a coalition of federal Liberals and Conservatives, Clark has been consistent about where her loyalty lies when it comes to the federal stage. A member of the Young Liberals during her time at Simon Fraser University in the 1980s, Clark came by her affiliation with the party honestly as her father, Jim, had run provincially three times for the party when it was still connected to the federal brand. His daughter later joined with Gordon Wilson and others to give the provincial Liberals their independence in the lead-up to the 1991 election, but has spoken about her continuing affinity for the federal party often in the decades since. Clark also served as a staffer in the Jean Chretien administration, where she worked beside LeBlanc. The pair have remained close friends in the years since. Mike Bernier, former B.C. Liberal MLA for Peace River South, says one of the main strengths Clark brings to the table, having been the education minister for the final two years of her government, is her charisma and ability to bring people together. This will be important if she steps in as the new leader of a deeply divided federal Liberal caucus, a situation similar to the one she inherited when taking over from Gordon Campbell as leader of the provincial government in 2011. ""Christy has more charisma as almost anybody I've ever met, she has an ability when she walks in the room, you can just feel that aura,"" said Bernier. ""Others might come in with a policy or a business background. Christy puts the smart people around her, meaning she doesn't have to be the person with all of those skill sets. Her idea is just to get people excited, how to get people to be part of something."" Bernier says Clark's more conservative credentials from her time in politics could be a help as he said there remain many people in Conservative ridings such as his that hold very favourable opinions of Clark due to her focus on blue-collar issues such as resource development while serving as premier. Also of help are her frequent criticisms of Trudeau, ranging from his purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018 to his refusal to resign this summer following a shocking defeat in the Toronto-St. Paul's byelection. ""I never thought there would be a prime minister in this country who would be deciding that the things that Canadians say, as long as it's not hate speech, are unacceptable,"" she said in 2022 after endorsing Jean Charest for federal Conservative leader. ""Implicit in his handling of the truckers'convoy was this message: 'If you don't agree with me ... you're a bad person, and if you do agree with me, you're a good person.'"" Those close to Clark are divided on whether a short or long race would be more beneficial to her. While a short race would limit the amount of money she would have to spend, a longer race would give her more time to sign up new members to support her. The former premier's longtime finance minister, Mike de Jong, said that the problem for Clark if she is elected is that she will be in charge of a party that is supremely unpopular and is expected to get wiped out of government by the federal Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre. De Jong, who will be running for the Tories, likened the Liberals to ""replacing the captain of the Titanic 20 minutes after it's struck the iceberg."" B.C. Conservative Leader John Rustad, who also served as a cabinet minister in Clark's government, agreed with de Jong. He said that, despite his respect for his former boss, he will be supporting Poilievre in the upcoming election. ""I enjoyed my time working with Christie. I have a lot of respect for her as premier. If she's going to go after the leadership of the federal Liberal party, I'm really not gonna have much to say about that,"" said Rustad. ""My perspective, though, is that we need significant political change. We need to bring some common sense back to this country. We need to get rid of things like the carbon tax. And so I only see one path forward with that, and that is with the current federal Conservative party.""","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 9, 2025",Conservatism; Leadership; Scandals; Prime ministers,,2025-01-09,The Vancouver Sun

Poilievre would be as bad as Trudeau: PQ,2025.0,"While describing Justin Trudeau as one of the worst prime ministers in history because of the way he has treated Quebec, the leader of the Parti Québécois said Tuesday that the potential winner of the next election isn't any better. Paul St-Pierre Plamondon said that if Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre becomes prime minister, he will govern by putting the interests of his voter base in the West and Ontario first, leaving Quebec out in the cold in much the same way Trudeau has. ""Pierre Poilievre will govern based on the interests and concerns of the Canadian West,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said at his first news conference of 2025. ""He doesn't need Quebec to win, and so he won't consider our interests and concerns."" Insisting he's not telling Quebecers how to vote federally, St-Pierre Plamondon nevertheless lumped Trudeau and Poilievre together as bad news for Quebec on everything from immigration to health transfer payments and secularism. The PQ leader went so far as to say Poilievre reflects the same kind of contempt for Quebec's independence movement that many western Canadians hold. ""Whether it is Trudeau's leftwing multiculturalism or the conservative right of the Canadian West, the contempt for Quebec is the same and striking,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said, referring to comments made by Poilievre in a recent interview with Jordan Peterson. St-Pierre Plamondon said he called in the media because he found Premier François Legault's response to Trudeau's resignation Monday lukewarm and not a reflection of the difficulties Quebec has experienced in Trudeau's nine years as PM. On Monday, Legault stuck to the positive in his comments on Trudeau's departure. ""Although our opinions have often diverged, I want to salute today the public service of Justin Trudeau and his commitment to Canada,"" Legault said in a statement. ""We have significant challenges ahead, particularly with the arrival of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. I will continue to work with Mr. Trudeau, his successor and the current government to avoid these tariffs."" St-Pierre Plamondon had his own post-mortem of Trudeau's performance, saying he has been a ""terrible, terrible, terrible"" prime minister as far as Quebec goes. ""He was perhaps one of the worst prime ministers in the history of Canada when it comes to the way he treated Quebec,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said. He insisted his acerbic criticism was justified because the government in Ottawa is about to change and it's time to take stock. He denied showing a lack of respect. ""Remember, Justin Trudeau did not die,"" he said. ""He resigned, and not because he wanted to. He had to be forced to leave after doing everything he could to hang on. That's why this morning I am not hesitating to examine his record by trying to be as factual as possible."" St-Pierre Plamondon ran down the list of things he felt Trudeau has bungled, including out-of-control immigration, zero interest in the demands of Quebec, doubling the national debt, plus all kinds of ideological drifting. ""Trudeau was not really qualified for that job,"" he said. ""But he was very useful for many interest groups who needed someone to push through their demands."" St-Pierre Plamondon said Poilievre would give Quebec other forms of frustration, such as having to put up with the Conservatives wanting to invest in oil development projects. Poilievre, he added, has never said where he stands on immigration levels and, like Trudeau, is opposed to Quebec's secularism law, Bill 21. Poilievre also has almost zero understanding of the Quebec independence movement except to say it exists because Trudeau weakened the economy, which he would fix, St-Pierre Plamondon said. As far as Poilievre is concerned, the independence movement represents a ""threat"" and he would have no intention of giving any legitimacy to Quebec's demands for more power should he take office, the PQ leader said. St-Pierre Plamondon said the only logical conclusion in his mind is that since the system won't change, it's time for Quebec to leave it and become a separate country. ""The problem is not Justin Trudeau,"" he said. ""It's the regime; it's Canada. The system is conceived to hamper or simply ignore Quebec's interests because we only have one-fifth of the seats in the Canadian Parliament. ""The PSPP crystal ball sees nothing good in what lies ahead in the event there is a Poilievre government,"" St-Pierre Plamondon added. ""Let's get out of this - voting Conservative only to witness the contempt for Quebec, to then move on and vote Liberal to witness the same contempt for Quebec.

It has been the preferred method of transition for B.C. governments of every political stripe over the past four decades. And it has worked more often than not. 1986: Premier Bill Bennett announced retirement after 10 years in office, clearing the way for a leadership contest in the governing Social Credit party. A dozen candidates sought the job. The winner, former cabinet minister Bill Vander Zalm, was nowhere near being Bennett's choice for a successor. The distancing helped, rather than hurt. Vander Zalm's populist charm contrasted sharply to Bennett's dour corporatism. The new premier called a snap election and defeated the NDP. 1991: Vander Zalm resigned after being found guilty of violating his own conflict of interest guidelines in the sale of his Fantasy Gardens theme park. The Socreds staged another high-profile leadership contest. Socred insider Rita Johnston narrowly defeated former cabinet minister Grace McCarthy. Unlike McCarthy, Johnston was too close to Vander Zalm to restore the party's fortunes. She lost badly to the NDP under Mike Harcourt. 1995: Now it was Harcourt's turn to go. He took the fall for the Nanaimo NDP funnelling the proceeds of charity bingos into its own coffers. An NDP leadership convention picked cabinet minister Glen Clark as the next leader and premier. Harcourt had styled himself as a cool premier for a hot province. Nobody ever said that about the hard-driving Clark. Again, the contrast paid off. In the 1996 election, Clark narrowly defeated the B.C. Liberals under Gordon Campbell. 1999: Clark resigned while under investigation in a casino-licensing scandal. The winner of the subsequent leadership race was attorney general Ujjal Dosanjh, who'd broken the news to Clark that he was under investigation. Despite that bit of distancing, Dosanjh couldn't rescue the NDP from myriad fiscal and policy failures. The NDP was crushed in the 2001 election, losing all but two seats to the Campbell-led B.C. Liberals. 2010: Campbell wounded himself by introducing the harmonized sales tax after an election in which it was barely mentioned. After failing to rescue the tax, he decided to leave. The leadership race was won in early 2011 by former cabinet minister turned broadcaster Christy Clark. She was not Campbell's choice - that was second-place finisher Kevin Falcon. The contrast worked the same electoral magic as the Bennett-Vander Zalm and Harcourt-Glen Clark transitions. With two full years to put her own stamp on the party, in 2013 Clark led the B.C. Liberals to victory and their fourth successive term of office. Four years later, Clark lost her legislative majority in a campaign distinguished by overconfidence and incompetence. The new premier, following Clark, was New Democrat John Horgan, who took office in partnership with the Greens. In 2020, he ambushed the Greens, repudiated the partnership, called a snap election and won decisively. 2022: Horgan, plagued by the cancer that would claim his life last year, announced his resignation. Cabinet minister David Eby secured the leadership and the premier's office after party insiders derailed his lone opponent for the job. Eby spent the next two years squandering the fiscal surplus and goodwill he inherited from his predecessor. Still in last year's election, he managed to hang on to the NDP majority by a single seat, secured by a 22-vote margin. Six times over the past 40 years, incumbent B.C. premiers cleared the way for a successor who could lead the party to another term. Four times the new premier went on to win the next election. Twice they failed to do so. The common factor in three of the most successful transitions was a favourable contrast in leadership styles, however briefly it lasted. In 2024, the contrast was unfavourable and the new leader just managed to survive. In the two transitions that failed, the new leaders had neither the time nor the ability to distance themselves from their predecessor's record. Expect to hear more about one of the foregoing successful transitions as the race to succeed Justin Trudeau unfolds in the weeks ahead. Christy Clark is expected to seek the leadership of the federal Liberals. Though she's been out of office for going on eight years, the taste for politics, once acquired, is not easily shed. She once compared it to an old boyfriend. ""In the first few months after you leave you still remember the reasons why you left,"" she told B.C. Business magazine. ""Then a couple of years down the road, you're sitting alone at night by yourself in your living room, maybe into a glass of wine, and you're thinking 'God that guy was great! I miss him so much,'And you pick up the phone and dial."" Lately Clark has been trying to reconnect with her old flame, politics. She'd have less time to turn things around this year. Still, she'll be mentioning - in a ""been there, done that"" sort of way - how she pulled out the big win after an unpopular leader stepped down. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 7, 2025",Leadership,,2025-01-07,The Vancouver Sun
"What does PM's exit mean for B.C.?; Clark seen as well-positioned to become Liberal leader, while Eby may be 'more visible'on trade",2025.0,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he will resign as soon as the Liberals elect his replacement as party leader. Here's a look at the reaction in British Columbia: WHO WILL REPLACE TRUDEAU? Trudeau has asked Liberal party president Sachit Mehra to immediately launch a leadership race. Among the potential replacements are former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney. Former B.C. premier Christy Clark publicly stated her interest in leading the Liberals last year. After Trudeau's resignation Monday, she posted in English and French on social media, thanking him for his leadership. ""I look forward to joining tens of thousands of Canadians to choose our next leader,"" she wrote. ""This is the biggest opportunity in over a decade that we've had to grow our party and welcome new Liberals - including Canadians concerned about the future of our country."" Clark, who was leader of the B.C. Liberal party and premier from 2011 to 2017, is a long shot to lead the federal Liberals, but ""may have a ghost of a chance because she represents such a dramatic change,"" UBC political scientist Stewart Prest said. Typically, the party would go with someone more well-established, such as Freeland, but given Trudeau's unpopularity and the country's ""anti-incumbent mood,"" Clark is well-positioned as a candidate. ""If there's a path available for Clark, it would be to present herself as a relative outsider for the party, but part of the liberal movement more broadly,"" Prest said. HOW DOES TRUDEAU'S RESIGNATION AFFECT B.C.? Prest said it'll be interesting to see if some Canadian premiers would step forward to take on more of a leadership role during the interregnum, when the federal government is effectively in caretaker mode. ""(Trudeau) is staying on as prime minister, but he's encumbered and limited on his ability to speak for the country,"" said Prest, who speculated whether some premiers, such as B.C.'s David Eby or Ontario's Doug Ford, would ""become more visible at this point speaking for the country on the international scene at a pivotal time for U.S.-Canada relations."" President-elect Donald Trump has threatened a blanket tariff on Canadian goods imported into the U.S. and has repeatedly referred to Canada as ""the 51st state,"" making the dig again after Trudeau's resignation. Speaking to reporters Monday, Ford made a counter-proposal to buy Alaska and Minnesota. WHAT ARE B.C. LEADERS SAYING? Eby, leader of the B.C. NDP: ""While we didn't always agree, I want to thank Justin Trudeau for serving as prime minister during some very difficult times our country has faced. British Columbians have benefited from several initiatives started under Justin Trudeau, including the federal government's decision to partner with B.C. on lowering the cost of child care. Today, we face new challenges and serious threats. Regardless of who is the next prime minister, we must come together as Canadians to protect workers and businesses against devastating tariffs."" B.C. Conservative Leader John Rustad: ""Trudeau's resignation and the prorogation of Parliament mark a pivotal moment for British Columbia and all Canadians. It's clear that Canadians are rejecting divisive, ideological leadership and are demanding a return to common-sense government - one that puts the priorities of everyday people ahead of outof-touch policies.""","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Chan, Cheryl; Ip, Stephanie",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 7, 2025",Resignations; Leadership; Canadians; Prime ministers,,2025-01-07,The Province
"PC critic for la Francophonie left off official languages committee; But bilingual Bill Hogan will likely eventually get a turn, says interim leader Glen Savoie",2025.0,"The Progressive Conservatives have left their bilingual critic for la Francophonie off a newly created committee dedicated to examining official languages issues. In the aftermath of October's election, the PCs named Woodstock-Hartland MLA Bill Hogan their health critic, and the critic for la Francophonie. But when the names of the languages committee members were recently unveiled, Hogan's wasn't among the three available to the PCs. Instead, the party chose interim leader Glen Savoie, Carleton-Victoria's Margaret Johnson, and Kings Centre MLA Bill Oliver. Neither of the latter two are fluently bilingual. MLAs on committees are allowed to claim daily travel expenses, and are also paid $125 per day. Committee chairs also get the travel allowance, and $200 a day. When asked why Hogan was left off the committee, Savoie told Brunswick News that there was nothing unusual about the party's selections, and that the PCs will rotate who's on it over time. ""Essentially, as a group we chose who we chose, and we have a policy of regularly reviewing who's going to be on a committee,"" Savoie said. ""So that could change over time, and indeed will change over time, because that's how committee structures work. You never keep the same people on the same committee all the time. You do tend to shift things around and move them as needed."" Savoie -who said Oliver ""has taken lots of French courses"" and that Johnson ""is working on her French"" -didn't answer directly when asked whether Hogan wanted to be on the committee. ""Well, everybody wants to be on committees,"" Savoie said. ""You know, this was just the process through which we chose. And like I said, if that needs to change, it'll change. Maybe it's me that comes off and Bill Hogan goes in at some time. But this was the group that we chose to go forward with right now, and ... we'll re-evaluate that as needed. That's literally the answer, because that's how we work.""","Telegraph-Journal; Saint John, N.B.","Saint John, N.B.","Waugh, Andrew",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 4, 2025",Committees; Bilingualism; Language policy,,2025-01-04,Telegraph-Journal
"Change will take time, Poilievre says; Peterson interview",2025.0,"Even before Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre gets a chance at possibly forming Canada's next government, he's warning supporters that implementing his agenda will be a challenge. Poilievre, who enters an election year riding high in opinion polls at the same time that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's days appear to be increasingly numbered, outlined the challenges he believes a future Conservative government would face in an interview with popular right-wing podcast host and author Jordan Peterson. The 90-minute interview marks the second lengthy sit-down Poilievre has given to Peterson, with the first being during his run for the Conservative party leadership in 2022. The pair enjoy a friendly relationship with overlapping audiences, particularly when it comes to young men. Peterson has extolled Poilievre's brand of conservatism and communications style and Poilievre has touted Peterson's 2018 book 12 Rules for Life and ended their most recent conversation by commending Peterson's legal fight with the College of Psychologists of Ontario. More than an hour into their conversation, Peterson asked Poilievre about his plan should his party form the next government. After listing off familiar promises, which include slashing federal spending on consultants as well as funding that goes to ""corporate welfare,"" and cutting ""foreign aid,"" Poilievre told Peterson he anticipates doing so will be a challenge. ""It's going to be a big fight with all these things because there are so many vested interests that will be trying to hold us back,"" he said. ""So many small economic groups that have profited off the status quo, they will be fighting against me."" He continued: ""I'm going to have to put out a call to Canadians that they have to stay politically active, they can't assume that by simply voting in an election that everything is going to - all the problems are going to reverse instantaneously."" Poilievre also keeps a list of who he believes could be a thorn in a future Conservative government's side. ""I will need people to put pressure on the Senate to adopt my economic reforms. I will need people to put pressure on their mayors and local councillors and let us build homes. I will need businesses to actually do their part."" After a comment by Peterson about oil and gas companies toeing what he called the ""green line,"" Poilievre did not mince words, calling them ""idiots."" ""The big five oil and gas companies in Canada have idiot lobbyists."" Poilievre promised that should Conservatives win the next election, Canadians can expect a ""rapid introduction of the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history."" ""A massive crackdown,"" said Poilievre. Asked what that could look like, he says it means that those who are repeat offenders will be not released from jail. Trudeau's government has also sought to tackle concerns raised by premiers and police chiefs about the prevalence of violent repeat offenders by introducing a series of bail reforms to the Criminal Code last year, changes Poilievre has panned as not going far enough. Next to prosecuting Trudeau's record on the cost of living, Poilievre has poured his time into trying to convince Canadians that the anxieties they feel about crime and disorder in their cities, ranging from an increase in auto thefts and random violence on public transit, to open drug use and more visible homeless encampments, are the fault of Trudeau's government.

Crack forms in NDP pledge to oust PM; Veteran mp says he won't back poilievre's 'procedural games'aimed at toppling trudeau,2024.0,"At least one NDP MP is reluctant to bring down Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government and force a federal election if it means putting Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in power. ""I have a long and consistent record of opposing Mr. Poilievre's tactics. I do not believe he is fit for leadership and will not support his procedural games,"" said NDP MP Charlie Angus, in an email to National Post, in a reference to a Conservative ploy to use the public accounts committee to quickly bring down the government in January. Angus posted to Facebook that he would ""put country first"" and would ""not vote with Pierre Poilievre to force an election."" Poilievre's Conservatives have a massive lead in the polls and would be heavily favoured to win a majority government if an election were held today. ""Canadians deserve a plan, not political brinkmanship"" wrote Angus. The MP's position clashes with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's pledge earlier this month to introduce a non-confidence motion when Parliament returns. ""If our party brings forward a motion it would be clear to me that the Trudeau government will fall,"" said Angus, although he didn't clarify if he would personally vote for the NDP non-confidence motion. Angus, who has already announced he won't be running in the next federal election, said that Trudeau's political shelf life is likely to be limited anyway, after the dramatic resignation of former finance minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Freeland resigned hours before she was set to deliver a fall economic statement that blew past the government's fiscal targets. In her resignation letter addressed to Trudeau posted on the social media site X, Freeland said she had argued for ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" in the face of serious economic threats from the United States. ""Ms. Freeland has done enormous damage to Mr. Trudeau and it's not clear how long this government will survive,"" said Angus. Since Freeland's resignation, Trudeau has weathered increasing calls from his own caucus to resign as leader, which would prompt a Liberal leadership race ahead of the upcoming federal election in 2025. New Brunswick MPWayne Long, who has been calling for Trudeau to step down since the summer, posted a letter from the Atlantic Liberal caucus addressed to the prime minister calling on him to resign. Atlantic caucus chair and Nova Scotia MP Kody Blois signed the letter, which argues that Canada needs new leadership to respond to tariff threats from incoming U.S. president Donald Trump. Blois also points to public comments by opposition leaders that they plan to vote non-confidence in the government when Parliament resumes. ""If we are to have any chance in the next election, and prevent a Pierre Poilievre government, we need new leadership with a new vision for our party and the country,"" Long wrote on Facebook. Calgar y Liberal MP George Chahal, one of the party's two MPs in Alberta, also called for Trudeau's resignation over the weekend, posting on social media a letter he sent to the president of the Liberal party. ""Our leadership is not hearing Canadians and many Liberals are ringing the fire alarm,"" wrote Chalal. Conservative MP John Williamson said Friday he plans to introduce a non-confidence motion at the next public accounts committee meeting on Jan. 7. If that motion is successful at committee, it would be forwarded to the House of Commons and could be voted on as soon as Jan. 30, triggering an election if it passes.

"Fresh faces for council with first female mayor; Stories of the year; Block took over top job from Clark, who decided not to seek re-election",2024.0,"The StarPhoenix is looking back on some of the stories that had the biggest impact in 2024. Today: Saskatoon's municipal election brought the city its first female mayor, and a list of new city councillors. Saskatoon's 2024 civic election featured a substantial city council turnover after former mayor Charlie Clark and four former councillors did not seek re-election. Former Ward 6 councillor Cynthia Block threw her hat into the mayoral race, pitting herself against former mayor Don Atchison, former Sask. Party MLA Gord Wyant, Cary Tarasoff and Mike Harder. Voters responded by making her Saskatoon's first female mayor. ""I think representation matters,"" Block said after winning on election night. ""I want every woman and girl to know that they can lead."" Block took the lead early in the ballot count and maintained that momentum throughout the night. With each 10 or so new polling stations reporting, around 1,000 votes were added to her lead. Ten women have run for mayor in previous elections, but none finished higher than second place. It's traditional for the main mayoral contenders to appear at city hall on election night, but Atchison and Wyant stayed away. In Ward 1, former councillor Darren Hill was unseated by Kathryn MacDonald. Senos Timon became Ward 2's councillor after Hilary Gough did not seek re-election. Robert Pearce took Ward 3 after David Kirton did not seek re-election. Jasmin Parker took Block's former Ward 6. Ward 7 went to Holly Kelleher after Mairin Loewen did not seek re-election. Scott Ford took Ward 8 after Serina Gersher did not seek re-election. Troy Davies and Randy Donauer were re-elected in Wards 4 and 5, while Bev Dubois and Zacj Jefferies were acclaimed in Wards 9 and 10. Top election issues that continue to be Saskatoon's most discussed topics include the city's housing crisis, construction of the new downtown public library, expensive plans for a Downtown Event and Entertainment District (DEED) and issues around accessibility and safety on public transit. Mayoral debates often led into criticism of previous council decisions on items such as the DEED and residential zoning changes to accommodate the federal government's Housing Accelerator Fund. Voter turnout in the election was 68,762 - higher than in the 2020 election, when 58,734 people voted, but lower than the 80,262 votes cast in 2016. This election was also the first time since 1988 when an incumbent mayor did not run. Back then, Cliff Wright decided not to seek a fifth straight term. Henry Dayday won his first mayoral term that year, finishing atop a four-candidate field.","Star - Phoenix; Saskatoon, Sask.","Saskatoon, Sask.",Brody Langager,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 31, 2024",Local elections; Mayors; Females; Councils,,2024-12-31,Star - Phoenix
Crack forms in NDP pledge to oust PM; Veteran mp says he won't back poilievre's 'procedural games'aimed at toppling trudeau,2024.0,"At least one NDP MP is reluctant to bring down Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government and force a federal election if it means putting Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in power. ""I have a long and consistent record of opposing Mr. Poilievre's tactics. I do not believe he is fit for leadership and will not support his procedural games,"" said NDP MP Charlie Angus, in an email to National Post, in a reference to a Conservative ploy to use the public accounts committee to quickly bring down the government in January. Angus posted to Facebook that he would ""put country first"" and would ""not vote with Pierre Poilievre to force an election."" Poilievre's Conservatives have a massive lead in the polls and would be heavily favoured to win a majority government if an election were held today. ""Canadians deserve a plan, not political brinkmanship"" wrote Angus. The MP's position clashes with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's pledge earlier this month to introduce a non-confidence motion when Parliament returns. ""If our party brings forward a motion it would be clear to me that the Trudeau government will fall,"" said Angus, although he didn't clarify if he would personally vote for the NDP non-confidence motion. Angus, who has already announced he won't be running in the next federal election, said that Trudeau's political shelf life is likely to be limited anyway, after the dramatic resignation of former finance minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Freeland resigned hours before she was set to deliver a fall economic statement that blew past the government's fiscal targets. In her resignation letter addressed to Trudeau posted on the social media site X, Freeland said she had argued for ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" in the face of serious economic threats from the United States. ""Ms. Freeland has done enormous damage to Mr. Trudeau and it's not clear how long this government will survive,"" said Angus. Since Freeland's resignation, Trudeau has weathered increasing calls from his own caucus to resign as leader, which would prompt a Liberal leadership race ahead of the upcoming federal election in 2025. New Brunswick MP Wayne Long, who has been calling for Trudeau to step down since the summer, posted a letter from the Atlantic Liberal caucus addressed to the prime minister calling on him to resign. Atlantic caucus chair and Nova Scotia MP Kody Blois signed the letter, which argues that Canada needs new leadership to respond to tariff threats from incoming U.S. president Donald Trump. Blois also points to public comments by opposition leaders that they plan to vote non-confidence in the government when Parliament resumes. ""If we are to have any chance in the next election, and prevent a Pierre Poilievre government, we need new leadership with a new vision for our party and the country,"" Long wrote on Facebook.

""After all, he voted confidence in his boss Justin Trudeau eight times after his big stunt where he 'ripped up'their costly coalition agreement,"" the statement reads. Angus, who has already announced he won't be running in the next federal election, said that Trudeau's political shelf life is likely to be limited anyway, after the dramatic cabinet resignation of Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16.

Since Freeland's resignation, Trudeau has weathered increasing calls from his own caucus to resign as leader, which would prompt a Liberal leadership race ahead of the forthcoming federal election in 2025. Some political observers have speculated Trudeau could shut down Parliament, either to resign and allow time for a leadership race or to reset his government's agenda before the election. Trudeau told his caucus that he would use the holidays to ""reflect"" on his future with the party. During a holiday ski trip to British Columbia, Trudeau has even faced the ire of passersby on the ski slopes, including a woman who told him to ""please get thef--out of B.C.""

Conservatives plan a power play; Poilievre seeks to bring government down quickly with motion MPs could vote on by Jan. 30,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has a plan to get the ""carbon tax election"" he has been calling for sooner rather than later. The Conservatives are going to reconvene the public accounts committee on Jan. 7 and use it to ship a motion of non-confidence to the House of Commons when the holiday break ends on Jan. 27. The party believes MPs will be able to vote on the motion by the end of January. If the NDP joins the other parties and votes in favour of it, the motion would bring down the government and spark a federal election. The move means the Conservatives won't have to wait for one of its ""opposition days"" in the House of Commons, which are controlled by the government, before it can test the House's confidence in the Liberal government. The motion is also designed to capitalize on NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's recent statement that his party is now prepared to bring down the government in the new year. In the wake of Chrystia Freeland's dramatic resignation as finance minister, Singh wrote a letter saying the ""Liberals don't deserve another chance"" and that he would vote non-confidence in the next sitting. Singh's pledge means that all the opposition parties have promised to bring down the government at some point in the new sitting. A request for comment to the NDP was not returned by press time. If the motion gets to the House of Commons it will be the first test of confidence for the government since Freeland's resignation on Dec. 16 triggered new uncertainty about the future of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Some Liberal MPs called for Trudeau to resign and others lauded Freeland for her stand against the prime minister. At least one MP openly encouraged the former finance minister to run for leader of the Liberals. On Friday, Trudeau's former top adviser and close friend Gerald Butts wrote in an email newsletter that Freeland's departure could be a political death blow for the prime minister. Butts said Trudeau was ""unlikely"" to lead the party into the next campaign before Freeland's resignation and is ""now much less likely to do so."" After shuffling his cabinet last week and spending Christmas Day in Ottawa, Trudeau's itinerary now says he is in British Columbia with no public events on his schedule. The motion the Conservatives plan to put before the committee will simply state that ""the Committee report to the House the following recommendation: That the House has no confidence in the Prime Minister and the Government."" The Conservatives'parliamentary gambit is sure to set off debate among constitutional academics about whether the government can be brought down by a committee report censuring it.

The government at the time said the motion was a mere procedural motion and not a confidence vote. This time could be different: Constitutional lawyer Lyle Skinner wrote on social media that if the Conservatives can get the committee to report back to the House of Commons it should be considered a confidence vote. ""If the public accounts committee does report back to the House a report expressing non confidence, and the House adopts it, even per the 2005 precedent, it is a non-confidence motion,"" wrote Skinner. ""A lot of ifs but it is harder to argue it is merely procedural."" Mitch Heimpel, a former Conservative strategist and now policy director of the public affairs firm Enterprise Canada, said the Conservatives are putting pressure on the Liberal government and the NDP with the move. ""From a tactics perspective, it puts eyes on Parliament over the break, and it puts the Liberal backbenchers on the committee (some of whom probably want Trudeau to leave) in the untenable position of potentially having to filibuster to protect him.

Whether the prime minister intends to resign or simply reset the agenda in his party's favour, it has been widely speculated he would prorogue Parliament to do so.

Clark changing the economic game in women's team sports,2024.0,"BULLS OF THE YEAR It was a huge year for the business of sport, with Caitlin Clark and the WNBA leading the charge in a game-changing year for women's basketball. She's not alone, but she is clearly the poster child for the new economic reality for women's team sports. Clark is making everyone around her wealthier. Explosive growth in media rights fees and overall revenues reached the stage where several North American pro sports teams posted more than 30 per cent increases in franchise valuation, year over year. The television juggernaut that is the National Football League - which we've dubbed the new social network - closes out 2024 with an average franchise value of US$5.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine. When your weakest links are still worth $4 billion and have grown by about 70 per cent since the pandemic, there's no one to feel sorry for. That's especially true when recent streaming deals will only drive more NFL revenue and audience in the years to come. Amazon Prime paid $100 million for the Black Friday stream last month while Netflix offered up $150 million for the NFL Christmas Day doubleheader that averaged 24 million, peaked at 27 million for a Beyonce halftime show and rallied more than 65 million unique viewers for at least part of the two games played on Wednesday of this week. Also having bullish years in 2024: Alternate telecasts, stadium design, podcasts and collectibles. More to come on those fronts in 2025. BEARS OF THE YEAR It was already a historically bad year for the Chicago White Sox, the Major League Baseball franchise that set an all-time mark for futility despite having the advantages of operating in the third-largest market in the U.S. Yet leave it to the Chicago Bears of the NFL to give them a run for the money as one of the biggest losers in the business of sport this year. The Bears (6-3 losers to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday) have now lost a record 10 straight games after starting the season at 4-2. Outside of deep playoff runs by the New York Yankees, New York Mets and New York Red Bulls, the Big Apple has been largely rotten in 2024. The biggest media market in North America has not one but two also-rans in the NFL (the 2-13 Giants in the NFC and the 4-11 Jets in the AFC), not to mention the New York Rangers, who are an absolute mess at the Christmas break despite being the second-richest franchise in the NHL, according to both Forbes and Sportico. Meanwhile, the Oakland Athletics are no more after one of the messiest and protracted breakups in North American team sport. After more than two decades of on-again, off-again talks about a new stadium in Oakland finally collapsed, the Athletics will play in Sacramento for three seasons while they work with Las Vegas stakeholders to fund and construct a new ballpark at the site of the Tropicana Hotel. Once one of the most storied blue-collar sport markets in North America, Oakland is now a shell of its former self, with the Golden State Warriors of the NBA now playing at the Chase Center in San Francisco, the Oakland Raiders in Las Vegas and the old California Seals long ago morphed into the Cleveland Barons, merged with the Minnesota North Stars and ultimately relocated to Dallas in 1993.

Conservatives plan a power play; Poilievre seeks to bring government down quickly with motion MPs could vote on by Jan. 30,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has a plan to get the ""carbon tax election"" he has been calling for sooner rather than later.

If the NDP joins the other parties and votes in favour of it, the motion would bring down the government and spark a federal election. The move means the Conservatives won't have to wait for one of its ""opposition days"" in the House of Commons, which are controlled by the government, before it can test the House's confidence in the Liberal government. The motion is also designed to capitalize on NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's recent statement that his party is now prepared to bring down the government in the new year. In the wake of Chrystia Freeland's dramatic resignation as finance minister, Singh wrote a letter saying the ""Liberals don't deserve another chance"" and that he would vote non-confidence in the next sitting. Singh's pledge means that all the opposition parties have promised to bring down the government at some point in the new sitting. A request for comment to the NDP was not returned by press time. If the motion gets to the House of Commons it will be the first test of confidence for the government since Freeland's resignation on Dec. 16 triggered new uncertainty about the future of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Some Liberal MPs called for Trudeau to resign and others lauded Freeland for her stand against the prime minister. At least one MP openly encouraged the former finance minister to run for leader of the Liberals. On Friday, Trudeau's former top adviser and close friend Gerald Butts wrote in an email newsletter that Freeland's departure could be a political death blow for the prime minister.

"A movement, not a moment: 2024 was the biggest year for women’s sports:   From Summer McIntosh and Simone Biles on the Olympic stage, to Caitlin Clark and the rise of the PWHL, this past year was full of stories of exceptional female athletes doing unprecedented things, Rachel Brady writes",2024.0,"This was the year Summer McIntosh dominated the world in the Paris Olympic pool, the year a best-on-best women’s pro hockey league burst into existence. It was the year Caitlin Clark helped elevate women’s basketball into must-see TV and the year Toronto landed a coveted WNBA franchise. Simone Biles returned to the Olympic stage, after a mental-health layoff, and delivered a gold-medal performance that stretched the limits of gymnastics skill. Female athletes appeared more frequently on network TV and social-media feeds in 2024, as they seized medals, scored skillful goals, hit big buckets and turned their game day tunnels into fashion runways. I’ve been lucky to watch and write about sports for a living for 25 years, and a significant portion each year has focused on women. In 2024, more than any other year of my career, stories of exceptional female athletes doing unprecedented things dominated my work calendar. It will go down as the year the world began to care more widely about women’s pro sports and recognize their appeal – evidenced by record-setting live attendance and broadcast audiences for several leagues, from the WNBA to the National Women’s Soccer League, and the newly launched Professional Women’s Hockey League. One of the must-have fashion items of 2024 was a T-shirt with the words “Everyone watches women’s sports”, popularized by celebrities donning it at games. My e-mails and texts were filled with story pitches, news tips, fresh market research substantiating the business-case for women’s pro sport and press releases about new franchises, broadcast deals and sponsors jumping aboard. Can you name one person who doesn’t know who Caitlin Clark is after her unprecedented 2024? Longtime friends who have never cared about sports suddenly wanted to discuss women’s sports, especially Clark. The two-time college national player of the year out of the University of Iowa, who became a rookie star with the Indiana Fever, mesmerized audiences by repeatedly swishing audacious long-range threes. Her fire was wildly entertaining, all chest-pumping and arms stretched wide. Clark’s reach was immense. She set a women’s basketball NCAA Division 1 scoring record, then eclipsed Hall of Famer Pete Maravich’s overall mark as the NCAA’s top scorer. The college championship game between Iowa and South Carolina averaged 18.9 million viewers, the No. 2 most-watched women’s sporting event in U.S. TV history outside the Olympic Games. For the first time, a larger audience tuned in for the women’s NCAA championship than for the men’s. Drafted into the WNBA first overall, Clark set a rookie record for most points in a season (769). She also set WNBA marks for most assists – in a season (337) and in a single game (19). The 22-year-old endured hard fouls in her WNBA debut year and was left off the 2024 U.S. Olympic team, as fans and media drummed up tension around those narratives. Still, it was undeniable Clark propelled growth for the league. In July, the WNBA signed a historic 11-year media-rights deal with Disney, Amazon Prime and NBC valued at about US$200-million a year, Sportico reported. The WNBA drew a record of more than 54 million unique viewers across its broadcasts this season. Its overall attendance (2,353,735) jumped 48 per cent year over year. The Fever set the WNBA record for home attendance by a franchise, with many of their road games moved to bigger NBA and NHL rinks to accommodate the demand to see Clark. Time and The Associated Press each chose her their athlete of the year. Clark calls herself a fan of women’s sports and said during the Final Four, “I think you see it across the board, whether it’s softball, whether it’s gymnastics, volleyball. People want to watch. It’s just when they’re given the opportunity, the research and the facts show that people love it.” The PWHL illustrated that as it launched in 2024. Some 2.9 million Canadians viewed the PWHL’s first game – between Toronto and New York on Jan. 1 – across CBC, Sportsnet and TSN. It set attendance marks, especially in its Canadian markets, including the 21,105 who filled Montreal’s Bell Centre. Just barely into its second season, the six-team league has already began exploring expansion. It has increased opportunities to see top athletes – including Natalie Spooner, Marie-Philip Poulin and Sarah Nurse – that most fans only saw every four years during a Winter Olympics. Females provided many of the biggest headlines at the Paris Olympics. Biles was the Games’ most famous headliner, as she earned four medals and Performed the “Biles II”, the most difficult vault in women’s gymnastics. It was a rousing return four years after the American superstar had withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health. McIntosh, the teen sensation who swam to four medals and carried Canada’s flag at the closing of the Olympics, was another luminary to draw worldwide attention. She set two Olympic records and became the first Canadian to win three gold medals at one Games. The CBC said some 27 million Canadians watched its Paris coverage, with McIntosh’s performances accounting for some of the most-watched moments. Women’s soccer grew its audience this year, too. The NWSL averaged crowds of 11,250 during the regular season, the league’s best attendance mark. In its first season with 14 teams – up from 12 – the NWSL surpassed two million total fans for the first time in its 12-season history. Its championship game set a ratings mark for NWSL match viewership, with an average audience of 967,900 on CBS. The Northern Super League, Canada’s new women’s pro soccer league, took major steps toward its launch in April, 2025, announcing owners and branding for its six franchises, and signing its first players. And Canada landed a long-awaited WNBA franchise, which will begin play in 2026. The news conference, held in May to announce the team, was one of the largest I covered all year in Toronto. It drew an enormous crowd of media and celebrities, everyone from Drake to Kyle Lowry and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Excitement for the new team continued, as more than 10,000 people submitted ideas to name the club, before Toronto Tempo was chosen. I noticed a palpable shift in interest and image across women’s sports. Sold-out events became commonplace. The athletes became more influential and coveted by sponsors as teams and leagues elevated their game-day experiences and invested heavily in their own glossy-looking marketing content. More media turned out to report on the women. The industry is growing in all directions. There’s been a burst of new podcasts about women’s sports. Whoopi Goldberg launched an all-women’s sports network. Unrivaled, a 3x3 off-season basketball league built by players, will make its debut in January. And a new women’s pro baseball league will start in the United States in 2026. The barrage reminds me of a sentiment I heard during countless interviews in 2024: women’s sport is not having a ‘moment’ it’s a ‘movement.’","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Brady, Rachel",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 28, 2024",Franchises; Olympic games; Womens sports; Teams; Audiences; Celebrities; Athletes; Females; College basketball; Medals; Soccer,Nom: National Collegiate Athletic Association--NCAA; NAICS: 813990; Nom: Womens National Basketball Association; NAICS: 813990,2024-12-28,The Globe and Mail
"Dear Manitobans, you're welcome: Tories:   Interim PC leader claims Kinew's NDP taking credit for what unpopular government did before 2023 election",2024.0,"As Manitoba’s Progressive Conservatives head into a new year when they’ll choose a new leader, they’re patting themselves on the back for “the many ways in which Manitobans have continued to benefit in 2024 from investments and initiatives launched by the previous PC government.” In a press release Friday, the Tories highlighted measures they initiated before losing to the NDP in October 2023. “The biggest thing was to basically remind Manitobans that (Premier) Wab Kinew is the beneficiary of the previous PC government planting all these trees and they’re now bearing fruit for Manitobans… and he’s taking credit for it,” interim PC leader Wayne Ewasko told the Free Press . The PCs say their government is the one Manitobans can thank for: lower taxes in 2024, expansion of the Selkirk Regional Health Centre, more health-care training seats and rapid access to addictions medicine clinics, the opening of a new school in Morden and work on a new personal-care home in Lac du Bonnet. As well Ewasko took credit for Winnipeg Transit safety officers, infrastructure at the Port of Churchill and the Canadian Premium Sands project; he said the Tories laid the groundwork for it in 2019. “Making sure every Manitoban is benefiting from the basic personal exemption increase — that’s going to put more dollars in absolutely everyone’s pockets,” he said, referring to the tax bracket thresholds increasing Jan. 1, 2024 by 28 per cent to $47,000 and by 26 per cent to $100,000. “Wab Kinew and his government continues to pat himself on the back for the new health-care workers,” he said, referring to the oft-repeated 870 net new hires. “They don’t just pop off from the post-secondary institutions overnight. You had to plant those seeds and the trees don’t grow overnight.” The province has known for 20 years about the looming staffing crisis but did nothing to prepare for it, said Ewasko. “Under our government, we did something about it and now Wab Kinew is able to reap the rewards,” he said. The PCs’ year-end messaging is also meant to counter the common NDP government refrain that any shortcomings in its performance — especially in health care — is the result of underspending and policy mistakes by the Tories, said University of Manitoba political studies professor emeritus Paul Thomas. “After a controversial, divisive campaign leading to a sizable electoral defeat — and still trailing the NDP badly in the polls, the PCs need to achieve some positive publicity, enhance their image in the public mind and improve morale among their supporters,” said Thomas. Claiming credit for the positive benefits of programs and spending after losing the reins of power is “not a regular occurrence,” he said. “In this instance, it is meant to remind Manitobans that not everything about the (former premiers Brian Pallister and Heather Stefanson’s) period was negative,” Thomas said. Both Pallister, the fiscally conservative PC premier who won the 2016 election and Stefanson, who replaced him in 2021 then resigned as leader after the party lost the 2023 election, were deeply unpopular when they left office. The April 26 PC leadership race between Fort Whyte MLA Obby Khan and Churchill business owner Wally Daudrich has attracted little publicity and appears to have generated little excitement among party members, Thomas said. “Clearly, the party would like to generate some momentum going into the new year as the political recovery efforts get seriously underway,” he said. A provincial government cabinet spokesperson dismissed the Tories’ claim to any success in 2024. “The former Stefanson government failed Manitobans on a number of issues, from health care to affordability, leaving behind a $2-billion deficit, a crumbling health-care system and fewer social housing options,” the spokesperson said in a statement Friday. “Their legacy also includes running the most disgusting, divisive campaign in Manitoba’s history.” The party vowed to “stand firm” on Stefanson’s refusal to search a Winnipeg-area landfill for the remains of two Indigenous women who were the victims of a serial killer. Police believe they are buried there. “While (the PCs’) record is full of empty promises, we are the government that is actually implementing the policies and getting the work done for Manitobans by continuing to fix health care and making life more affordable for families,” the cabinet spokesperson said. One organization chided the Tories for describing government spending as “PC investments” and “PC measures.” “These are measures of the duly elected government at that time, paid for by Manitoba taxpayers,” said Molly McCracken, Manitoba director of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The PCs’ press materials omitted the $1.6 billion in taxes slashed by the Pallister/Stefanson government, bringing Manitoba’s own-source revenue relative to GDP to the lowest level in almost 20 years, McCracken said. The tax cuts left the Manitoba government with the largest deficit in history outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, she said “The loss of this tax revenue makes Manitoba vulnerable to economic shocks or changes in federal equalization payments,” she said. However, McCracken accused the NDP government of doing too little for the people who are struggling the most. carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipe g, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 28, 2024",Leadership; Health care,,2024-12-28,Winnipeg Free Press
Anti-woke agenda coming; No doubt Poilievre will follow Trump's anti-DEI lead,2024.0,"The recent spectacular and decisive presidential election victory by Donald Trump - a self-styled benevolent ""dictator"" swept to power with an unequivocal mandate from U.S. voters - has become what can only be described as a political tsunami for left-leaning observers. Vast change is in the offing. The political tectonic plates have shifted, prompting shattering eruptions along a number of predictable fault lines. One such fiery volcano is gender ideology, a demonstrable fantasy that, mercifully, will soon be banished from American institutions, its many purveyors quickly to be bankrupted by Trump's proposed state-assisted lawsuits brought by the swelling ranks of detransitioners. A second is education, a metaphorical marshmallow that is no longer merely the artificially-sweetened confection promised to so many young people, but has instead become more like a skewered and charred husk grilled remorselessly on the three-pronged toasting fork of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Americans need worry no longer, however. In a recent post on X, Elon Musk shared Donald Trump's radical vision of a reformed college education system - one that demands the eradication of all DEI and its apparatchiks, and even threatens uncompliant institutions with severe taxation or complete forfeiture of their sprawling endowments. Inevitably, we will witness brazen back-peddling by the cadre of top-tier administrators desperate to remain gainfully employed. Harvard's board, sitting on a treasure horde of US$53.2B (C$74.8B), will doubtless respond accordingly. How will Canadian universities survive? While plunging needles into voodoo dolls of Pierre Poilievre, the left will eschew the 'scary'stateside politics, make accusations of neo-fascism, and point to Canada as a progressive retreat, a haven for the many orphans of woke ideology who, even now, are threatening on their social feeds to lay siege to our border, waving their American passports. But what is far more likely, judging from predictions by even the state-sponsored CBC which suggest with 99 per cent certainty a Conservative win in 2025, is that the Canadian government in a year's time will follow suit. Even the dullest minds in the upper administrations of Canada's top universities must see the writing on the wall. Here is the unvarnished reality in Canada in higher education in 2024. Students are being ripped off. Their degrees have been continuously devalued by the twin cudgels of enrolment inflation, as ballooning cohorts are funnelled through our universities, and the softening of standards in the face of academic appeasement and growing accommodations. You might raise an eyebrow at that last remark. Academic accommodations are a form of concessionism where, according to a recent report at Queen's University, where nearly one in four students (22 per cent) gain some kind of benefit, usually in the shape of extended time allotments for examinations, to correct for what is often a largely imagined state of mental impairment. In short, if you get anxious, the university concedes that you deserve more time than everyone else. This hardly constitutes quality education, and it inevitably dilutes academic standards. Obsequious compassion is showered on the deserving minorities; but if you are a hard-working student with no stakes in the victimhood game, well, you just have to suck it up. Universities have consequently become expensive pre-adulthood training grounds that now choose to deride diligence, talent, and commitment in favour of equitable practices that attempt to champion anyone choosing to identify into minorities defined by inherent characteristics - gender, race, and sexuality. Indeed, their compulsive obsession with ""belonging"" - cited a mere 27 times, for example, in UofT's most recent 17-page DEI report - has all the allure of a brain hemorrhage. It will be interesting to see how they adapt to this new, inclement climate. For instance, in my own department, there are 40 staffers who support a suite of professional graduate programs. Based on published United Steel Workers'pay scales and benefit rates, this costs the university - a taxpayer funded enterprise - well in excess of $3.5M per year. For a typical program, a quarter of the allotted budget is sucked up by administrative overhead. All of the appointees would doubtless declare graduate-school exceptionalism and, in the same breath, grouse about the ever-present patriarchy. But inspection shows only 24 per cent are men, and 40 per cent are, unsurprisingly, white women. Now, sandwiched between provincial funding cuts and a collapse in international student admissions, campuses like mine will have to muster major savings as budget holes dilate in an ever-gloomier climate. Punitive financial incentives imposed by an incoming Conservative government will doubtless see a rapid turnaround as academics and administrators alike rush to gaslight everyone claiming that woke waste - characterized so effectively by journalist Charlotte Gill in Britain - was all ""unintentional."" Pull the other one. Recent propaganda sheets such as The Bulletin of the Canadian Association of University Teachers and Academic Matters, the journal of the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, which purport to represent professors like myself, are awash with racist DEI and tout a slavish fealty to obsessive and damaging social justice ideology. If you belong to the editorial team of either of these absurd political pamphlets, please drop me from your mailing list. There is hope for students. Jordan Peterson has lately launched his academy, which, though limited to the social sciences so far, has breached the universities'monopoly and comes at a bargain price. And the content is excellent, featuring such stellar authorities as Andrew Roberts, James Orr, John Vervaeke, Eric Kaufmann and a host of others. I've signed up. Time is running out for legacy universities across Canada. I have a fancy next year we will see the same wave of comedy meltdowns that followed Trump's re-election, just this time by an army of capitulating academics. ""We didn't mean to indoctrinate you with our untested ideology - Please give us more money."" Clink-clink. Too bad. It's not in the cards.

Poilievre's prison stance is normal one; PM's transgender inmates policy an open net for Conservatives,2024.0,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't have to adopt the most extreme positions within the world of social justice and completely cede the cultural mainstream to his opposition. But he did, which is how we got a statement like this from Pierre Poilievre on Sunday: ""I can't believe I have to say this: but when I'm PM, there will be no male prisoners in female jails. Period."" He was responding to a recent horror story out of Quebec. One Mohamad Al Ballouz brutally killed his wife and two sons in 2022, and last week was sentenced to life in prison with no shot at parole for 25 years. Because he now identifies as ""Levana,"" Al Ballouz has asked to serve that sentence in a women's prison, the Joliette Institution for Women. If the wish is granted, female inmates there will have to share space with a male counterpart who stabbed his wife 23 times. It would be an absurd and inhumane scenario - and it's only possible because of a 2017 policy change championed by Trudeau that requires prisoners to be sorted according to gender identity and not genitalia. Today, a fully intact criminal - rapists included - can be housed in the same facility as vulnerable women, balls and all. The first transfer, gang-related killer Fallon Aubee, formerly Jean-Paul, was moved into a women's facility in 2017 in a move that warmed hearts at CBC. It only continued from there. Trans-identifying bank robber Sam ""Steven"" Mehlenbacher was kept in a female prison and, according to another inmate, caused three women to require the morning-after pill; Mehlenbacher went on to receive a sexual assault charge, but it was eventually dismissed. Most vile is perhaps the incarceration of baby rapist Tara Desousa (Adam Laboucan) and serial pedophile Madilyn Harks (Matthew Harks) in a female facility. In 2021, a women's advocate reported to the House of Commons that both individuals had been antagonizing a fellow inmate and her child in the facility's mother-child program. People like this have no place whatsoever in a women's prison. Unfortunately, the prime minister doesn't agree. Before 2017, all pre-op trans prisoners were kept in a prison dedicated to their sex; only post-op males had a pathway to female prisons. A key factor limiting transfers was the fact that preop transgender-identifying males weren't eligible for surgery unless they'd lived for a year as a woman prior to prison. It kept the barrier to entry for female prisons high, even though it wasn't perfect. But in 2016, riding the hype train of Netflix's trans-plotline-featuring Orange is the New Black, then-minister Ralph Goodale signalled that a more accommodating prison policy was on the way. In January 2017, he unveiled the new change: prisoners would now be eligible for cross-sex surgery if they lived as the opposite sex for one year, in prison or out. It wasn't enough, however: a few days later, Trudeau was confronted at a town hall by a transgender activist who accused the federal prison system of committing ""torture"" and decried the fact that women of ""any other type"" aren't put in men's prisons. Trudeau promised to look into the matter before uttering the magic words, ""trans rights are human rights."" A week later, federal prisons were ordered to evaluate transgender transfer requests on a case-bycase basis, eliminating the old standard that restricted transfers to post-op individuals. The prime minister accelerated, exposing female prisoners to violent male offenders all because of one self-interested activist at a town hall. The rest of the country, for the most part, isn't on board with any of this. Just under 80 per cent of Canadians believe that it's ""somewhat important"" or ""very important"" to segregate prisons by sex, according to 2023 polling by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. A little more than 70 per cent believed that trans prisoners should be kept away from female inmates. And because he agrees with them, Poilievre is smack-dab in the middle of normal culture: regardless of their partisan leanings, the overwhelming support for sex-segregated prisons shows that most people are Team Conservative on this one. For the sake of women in jail, thank goodness. It's a matter of common sense, really: men are bigger and stronger than women, therefore, they present the greatest threat. Plenty of Canadians want adults to be free to live as the opposite sex - but that does not include the freedom to leer at women in a federal institution. Trudeau, on the other hand, made his party into one that will ceaselessly defend Al Ballouz's right to be housed in a female prison after stabbing his poor wife to death. Talk about cold, cruel and small.

"Houston, PC party turning page from a fruitful 2024",2024.0,"Premier Tim Houston could not have scripted a much better year than he and the Progressive Conservative party lived in 2024. The party rang in 2024 with a majority government, holding 31 of the 55 provincial seats. The PCs gained three seats before the fall snap election call after Liberals Brendan Maguire and Fred Tilley crossed the floor to join the Tory caucus and PC candidate Twila Grosse won an August byelection to claim the Preston riding formerly held by the Liberals. The late November landslide victory for Houston and his party gave the PCs 43 seats, more than any other party had ever won in a provincial election. The pressing question, however, is if Nova Scotians are better off heading into 2025 than they were when the Houston government vaulted into office in an August 2021 election. ""Certainly health care was not in a really good space,"" Houston said of the transfer of power to the PCs 40 months ago. ""We know there's work to be done but in lots of ways we kind of stabilized it,"" the premier said of health care. ""We start to see the 'need a family practice'list coming down, that's one metric that people like to look it. That's because of policy decisions we made to build capacity, that's because of policy decisions we made in looking at the scope of practice for a number of health-care professionals."" Houston said his government's hard work on several files is starting to produce some results. ""The fact that we're building more homes in this province. These things take time for sure but there are more homes being built. We're starting to see the vacancy rate nudge up just a little bit. That's an indication that some of the policy decisions we made are starting to work. That's a good thing. When you look forward for this province, there is so much potential to grow the economy. That will be a big focus of ours right now. This is a great province. We have our challenges but there is lots good happening in this province and the country is really noticing what's happening here."" As of Nov. 27, there were 119,670 Nova Scotians, 11.3 per cent of the population, on the Need a Family Practice Registry, down significantly from the 132,166 people who were unattached to a primary care provider in early November and the 160,234 people on the registry list in June. The November number is still nearly 45,000 more than the August 2021 count of just more than 75,000, when Houston and the PCs took office on the promise to fix health care. ""This is a province that was built on hard work. Nova Scotians understand hard work and they recognize those that work hard when they see it,"" Houston said when asked if progress being made in health care, housing and affordability is happening fast enough to meet Nova Scotians' expectations. ""I think with the election results, 43 PC seats, there has never been a time in this province where a government was elected with that high of a seat count, I take that as a message from Nova Scotians to our government that they recognize that we're working hard and that they expect us to continue to work hard and maybe even work harder, if that's possible."" Houston said he takes to heart the responsibility Nova Scotians have thrust on him and the PC team. ""We know there's lots of work to be done but we have the team to do it and we're committed to doing the hard work and realizing the potential of this province."" Houston defends the decision to call an early election for November despite a legislated commitment to a fixed election that would have taken place July 15, 2025. ""I didn't receive an ask from Nova Scotians saying you better do a whole bunch of things differently this time, I received a message to keep going,"" Houston said. ""You're on the right path on health care, keep going. I'm also receiving a message from across the country. I received a message on housing, keep going, housing starts are up, we're seeing more homes, vacancy stats are starting to go up, we're seeing homes built faster, keep going."" Houston said Nova Scotians looked at their options and said ""we see one team that can get it done and that's the PC team and the election result showed pretty clearly that they trust us and we feel that trust and we'll work hard to honour that trust."" Of the 43 caucus members, Houston appointed 20 to join him in cabinet and the remaining 21 PC MLAs were handed ministerial assistant appointments. ""The MLAs know that there is lots of work to be done across the files and departments and they individually bring unique perspectives, talents and backgrounds to it, so the way we're structuring it is to make sure that they can put their talents to the best use on behalf of Nova Scotians,"" Houston said of the challenge of managing such a large caucus. ""I think we found the right balance for that."" Houston is well aware of the consequences of the threat by United States president-elect Donald Trump to levy a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods crossing into the U.S. ""The U.S. is certainly a vital trading partner for Nova Scotia, they buy the largest share of our exports, everything from tires, lumber, to agricultural products, seafood, paper, so they are a very significant trading partner,"" he said. ""There are very strong family connections between Nova Scotians and New England and, beyond that, that's just a really strong relationship. The tariffs are a concern.... I'm on the Team Canada approach, we hope that we don't see those tariffs come in, we're doing everything we can to make sure that they don't and to be ready for them if they do. The premiers are on that page, we'll get the federal government there too and we'll work collectively for the best interests of Nova Scotians and Canadians."" As the calendar flips to 2025, Houston says he takes the role of premier very seriously. ""I believe very strongly in life that you get what you put in, so I put a lot into being premier,"" he said. ""I feel the weight of the job, I interact with Nova Scotians quite a bit and I listen carefully to them and when they're struggling I feel that. I take it very personally. The health-care file is still a big focus, making sure people have access to health care, but across the spectrum, people worry about the education their children and loved ones are getting, making sure people see the hope of buying a home in this province. ""These are all things that matter to Nova Scotians and, because they matter to Nova Scotians, they matter to me.""","Chronicle - Herald; Halifax, N.S.","Halifax, N.S.","Campbell, Francis",CNW Group Ltd.,"Dec 27, 2024",Provincial elections; Election results; Health care; Housing starts; Tariffs,Nom: Progressive Conservative Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2024-12-27,Chronicle - Herald
Liberals attack Poilievre in Quebec; PM's lieutenant warns Legault of 'catastrophe',2024.0,"Quebec Premier François Legault should think twice before asking for a change of government in Ottawa if he still wants money for his projects, warns Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Quebec lieutenant. ""We know that a Conservative government would be very damaging not only for Quebecers but for the government of Quebec,"" said Jean-Yves Duclos in an interview. Duclos accused federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre of being against several agreements and transfers favourable to Quebec in daycare, innovation, the Quebec tramway project and a transfer of $2 billion in housing. Poilievre has indeed promised to scrap the multi-billion dollar tramway project that has been making headlines in Quebec for years. He has also announced that he will tackle housing affordability by reducing the GST on home purchases under $1 million and that he will fund this project by cutting the Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund and the Housing Accelerator Fund. He has not, however, promised to scrap the childcare program passed earlier this year, from which Quebec will receive a total of $6 billion over five years because it already has a provincial program. ""It would be a catastrophe for the Quebec government if a Pierre Poilievre government were elected,"" Duclos said. Duclos gave a year-end interview to the National Post before his colleague, Chrystia Freeland, resigned from cabinet on Dec. 16, sparking a new crisis among the Liberals. During the interview, Duclos spoke about the Liberal meltdown in Quebec in 2024, but also about his relationship with the Quebec government. Despite the fact that Duclos was named Quebec's point person to the Quebec government on Sept. 19, Premier François Legault asked the PQ leader ""to have the courage today to ask his Bloc Québécois comrade to back down, not to support the Trudeau government"" in a confidence motion presented by the Conservative party. In Ottawa, the Liberals couldn't believe their ears. In 2021, Legault had made a similar request by inviting Quebecers to oust Trudeau's Liberals from power and to support Erin O'Toole's Conservatives. But Quebecers brushed that suggestion aside and went on to elect a majority of Liberal MPs and a handful of Conservatives. Having just replaced his colleague, Pablo Rodriguez, who had resigned from cabinet to run for the leadership of the Quebec Liberal party, Duclos couldn't believe Legault was once again attacking his party. Today, he thinks Legault understands that it was a mistake. Because at the time, Poilievre hadn't yet said he was going to cancel the housing agreement. ""Eight thousand social housing units, what a disaster it would be for homelessness and housing in Quebec if the Quebec government lost this $2-billion agreement. He didn't know it in September, now he knows it,"" he said. As a Quebec City MP and minister of the public services and procurement department, Duclos regularly deals with his provincial counterparts in a relationship that has its ""ups and downs."" This year, there have been many downs. In Ottawa, many Liberals were tired of being Quebec's easy target. Especially when it came to the asylum seeker file, which was at the heart of Legault's outburst in September. As it turns out, a letter from Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Immigration Minister Mark Miller about the federal government's plan to address the problem has clarified the situation for Quebec. Things have been looking more positive lately, but Duclos admits that dealing with his home province's government isn't easy. Quebec is constantly at odds with Ottawa on many issues, including immigration. Under an agreement between the province and the federal government in 1991, the Quebec government manages the volume of entries of its future permanent residents and economic immigrants. The federal government must take care of welcoming refugees, family reunification and all issues related to citizenship. For years, the Legault government has been asking Ottawa for more powers. Earlier this year, Trudeau was clear: ""No, we are not going to give more powers (to Quebec) in terms of immigration."" ""Maybe we don't have everything we want with a Liberal government, but it would be much worse for the Quebec government to have a Pierre Poilievre government with everything we know now,"" said Duclos.

Clark beats Biles for top AP female athlete,2024.0,"Caitlin Clark raised the profile of women's basketball to unprecedented levels in both the college ranks and the WNBA, and on Tuesday she was named The Associated Press female athlete of the year for her impact on and off the court. After leading Iowa to the NCAA championship game, Clark was the top pick in the WNBA draft as expected and went on to win rookie of the year. Fans packed arenas and millions of television viewers - ratings were up 300 per cent leaguewide - tuned in to follow her journey. Clark's exploits were far reaching, casting a light on other women's sports leagues along the way. Clark received 35 votes from a panel of 74 sports journalists. Olympic gymnast Simone Biles was second with 25. Boxer Imane Khelif finished third with four votes. Since the award was first presented in 1931, Clark is only the fourth women's basketball player to win, joining Sheryl Swoopes (1993), Rebecca Lobo (1995) and Candace Parker (2008, 2021). ""I grew up a fan of Candace Parker and the people who came before me, and to be honoured in this way is super special and I'm thankful,"" Clark said in a phone interview.

Dix-Clark may light fire under B.C. Hydro,2024.0,"When Glen Clark retired two years ago as president of the Jim Pattison Group, the former premier let it be known that he was ready, willing and able to help out the current NDP government. ""I would like to do something if I could that would be helpful on some issues,"" said Clark. ""Where I can be the most help, you know."" He further suggested that he would be a good choice to head up B.C. Housing. ""The premier's made a bunch of commitments on housing that I completely laud him for, so now they've got to execute,"" Clark told Andrew McLeod of the Tyee. Then again: ""They may feel my knowledge could be better used somewhere else, and I'd be interested in that, too, as long as it's something worthwhile that would allow me to make a difference."" There was also this testimonial from the namesake of the Jim Pattison Group, where Clark worked and thrived for 22 years. ""Glen's a good worker, a hard worker, and he's got a lot of common sense. He's decisive. We like Glen a lot,"" the legendary billionaire told John Mackie of Postmedia. That is where matters stood as of early January 2023. But as the weeks gave way to months, there was no sign that the government had taken up Clark's offer. He wasn't interested in a functionary position, and apparently that was all the David Eby government had to offer. Clark continued to serve as Pattison's representative on the boards of Canfor and Western Terminals. He became a senior adviser to Rogers Communications and CEO of the Overstory Media Group. He also offered some unsolicited advice to the premier during a B.C. Business Summit in June of this year. The Eby government should shift its attention from ""wealth distribution"" to ""wealth creation,"" said Clark. By the time the election rolled around, it was easy to forget that Clark had ever offered his services or been rebuffed. Then came Friday's news that the government had found a job worthy of Clark's abilities. The former premier and Pattison executive was named chair of the board at B.C. Hydro. ""Premier David Eby has tasked me with moving our province's clean-energy agenda forward,"" said Energy Minister Adrian Dix. ""That's why I am taking action to ensure that we have the knowledge, experience and skill set on B.C. Hydro's board of directors."" Three other directors were named as well, including Canfor president Don Kayne. But Clark was the key. There was no overlooking the deep connection between him and the energy minister. When Clark was premier in the 1990s, Dix served as his chief political adviser. The two also shared a condo near the legislature. Rare was the political issue on which Dix did not serve as Clark's eyes and ears. When Clark was accused of meddling in casino licensing on behalf of a friend, his denial was backstopped by a memo from Dix. It declared that the premier had ordered staff to ""insulate"" him from the licensing issue. Later, it came out that Dix had typed up the memo months after the order was supposedly given. Then he backdated it using the official stamp from the premier's office. Dix was fired. Clark resigned as premier not long afterward because he was facing a criminal investigation over the casino licence. He was acquitted on a charge of breach of trust, but was found to have twice violated the province's conflict-of-interest legislation. Clark was hired by Pattison while still embroiled in the criminal case. Over two decades, he climbed to the top of the Pattison Group, no small feat working for one of the most demanding bosses anywhere. Dix came back as well, winning election in Clark's old seat in 2005. He later won the party leadership, then lost the election, but bounced back to serve as health minister in the John Horgan and Eby governments. In the post-election shuffle, the premier named Dix energy minister with instructions to ""increase and expand electricity (generation) and low-carbon energy projects in B.C."" Eby says Hydro is moving too slowly: ""It takes eight to 10 years to fulfil a request from industry for the kind of electricity that they are looking for. We have to speed that up."" His government this month waived independent environmental reviews for nine new wind power projects, all the while insisting - trust them - that ""robust environmental permitting processes will remain in place."" The need is ""urgent,"" says Dix. That theme should sit well with the new board chair at Hydro. The retiring chair, Lori Wanamaker, is a career public servant. Clark is the furthest thing from a bureaucrat. As premier, Clark famously declared that ""process is for cheese."" He also branded Greenpeace and other critics of provincial forest policies as ""enemies of B.C."" Eby says all nine wind farms must be up and running by 2031. He also wants Hydro to pick up the pace with new calls for generation proposals every two years. If anyone can deliver on that timetable, it is probably the hard-driving combination of minister Dix and board chair Clark. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 24, 2024",,"Nom: Jim Pattison Group; NAICS: 424910, 441110, 541850",2024-12-24,The Vancouver Sun

Clark was named chair Friday to take over from Lori Wanamaker, a career civil servant whom Premier David Eby appointed less than a year ago and will leave the position Dec. 31, in a shakeup of Hydro's board that will see three other new directors join its ranks. In a news release, staff in the ministry of energy wrote that ""Clark brings extensive leadership, corporate relations and resource development experience"" to the position at a time Hydro is under pressure to expand the province's power supplies to meet ambitious objectives of the government's CleanBC plan. Clark retired from his high-profile job at the Pattison Group in 2022, 20 years after the firm's founder, Jim Pattison, surprised the political world by hiring the former premier who left politics in 1999 after a scandal. Clark resigned from politics after allegations were raised that he had accepted favours, renovations to his east Vancouver house and a new deck from a neighbour who happened to be involved in an application for a casino in North Burnaby. He was charged with breach of trust in the matter, but acquitted at the conclusion of a 2002 trial. Pattison hired Clark in 2001, starting him as head of the B.C. branch of his Jim Pattison Sign Group. Clark then rose through the ranks to become president and chief operating officer of the Jim Pattison Group for the last seven years of his corporate career. The province announced Clark's appointment on the same day it approved a proposed 104-megawatt solar farm in the southern Interior near Logan Lake, which will be added to the roster of nine wind energy projects intended to deliver enough electricity to power 500,000 homes. He is joined on the board by new appointees Merran Smith, a well-known environmentalist and founder of Clean Energy Canada, union leader Bryn Bourke, executive director of B.C. Building Trades, and forestry executive Don Kayne, CEO of Canfor Corp. They will replace Irene Lanzinger, a former president of the B.C. Federation, resources expert Daryl Fields, both of whom are retiring, as well as financial consultant Victoria McMillan and financial executive Amanda Hobson, whose terms are ending. depenner@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Penner, Derrick",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 21, 2024",Political appointments,,2024-12-21,The Vancouver Sun

Poilievre says Canada 'will never' be 51st U.S. state; Global journal,2024.0,"On Friday, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre rejected U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's repeated suggestions Canada could become the 51st state, stating that it ""will never happen,"" CTV News reported. Poilievre stressed his commitment to defending Canada and criticized Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, attributing Trump's remarks to Trudeau's lack of control. Trump previously made social media posts calling Canada America's 51st state and referring to the prime minister as ""Governor Justin Trudeau."" While federal officials have largely ignored Trump's comments, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and former Quebec Premier Jean Charest have rejected the idea. Poilievre addressed Trump's tariff threats, saying he would not compromise on the country's security or economy.","Telegraph-Journal; Saint John, N.B.","Saint John, N.B.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 21, 2024",,,2024-12-21,Telegraph-Journal
Singh says NDP will vote to bring down government; Trudeau Liberals in Chaos; Poilievre Skeptical,2024.0,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said his caucus will vote to bring down the Liberals'minority government when Parliament reconvenes in the new year. ""The Liberals don't deserve another chance,"" Singh said in a statement posted to social media on Friday morning. ""That's why ... we will put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons."" With Singh's announcement, all three major opposition party leaders are now calling for an early 2025 election. The first opportunity for a non-confidence vote won't come before at least the end of January as the House rose Tuesday and isn't currently scheduled to sit again until Jan. 27. If such a vote passes, it would trigger an election. Singh called on Monday for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign, after Chrystia Freeland's bombshell departure from cabinet, but didn't commit to bringing the Liberal government down in a confidence vote. He struggled to defend this non-committal position in a circuit of year-end interviews this week. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet both said earlier this week that an election must take place early next year to give a new Parliament time to deal with incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. He will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Poilievre reacted to Singh's letter by calling it a ""stunt."" ""You did the same stunt in September, claiming you'd no longer prop Trudeau up. Then you went back on your word and voted eight times against an election and for your boss Trudeau,"" Poilievre wrote on X, referring to Singh ending the supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals. After that agreement ended Singh said his party would vote on confidence matters on a case-by-case basis. The NDP voted against the three confidence motions put forward by the Conservatives this fall. Trudeau has yet to address Freeland's departure publicly but told Liberal MPs earlier this week that he will reflect on the situation and what he was hearing from them. Trudeau shuffled his cabinet on Friday to replace ministers who have left or informed him they won't run again in the next election.

Poilievre speech signals 2025 defeat for liberals; Conservative leader delivers knockout punch to government already on the ropes,2024.0,"Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre gave a test drive in the House of Commons this week to his likely stump speech for the 2025 election. I'll suggest the speech did more than just hit the spot. It went viral online because it packed the punch of an Evan Bouchard slapshot, so devastating it brought to mind the question of just how low the popularity of the Liberals will sink in the final vote count. In Canada's 44 federal elections, the Liberals have won 24 of them, giving rise to its boast that it is ""Canada's natural governing party."" But not in 2025 it won't be, not with the dislike, if not contempt, many Canadians now hold for both party leader Justin Trudeau, who might be changed out, but also for the party's platform and process, which are impossible to quickly jettison. It was one thing for the moderate, centrist Liberal political party of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin to modify or even discard policies that came out of a compromise group consensus. It is another for the remaining members of the Trudeau Liberals to reject radical party views on race, trans, crime, drugs, immigration, climate change and homelessness. Such policies evolved into sacred cows under Trudeau. He made it his calling for such policies to be seen as not just politically expedient and on-the-whole beneficial, but as morally virtuous and as existential imperatives. It will take some doing for Liberal party members to throw off such a yoke, even as many of the rest of us are desperate for change, as Poilievre made clear in his speech. Poilievre said he regularly meets two kinds of people in his travels, first those who are little better off and who bluntly tell him if the Conservatives don't win, they'll leave Canada. He said he's not worried about that group. Instead he's worried about the ones who are too poor to either move away or to make it here. He described meeting a restaurant waitress. ""She came up to me, grabbed me by the hand and said that I have to win. I thanked her and said that I appreciated her support. She said, no, it was not a compliment. Then she told me her story."" She had a full-time job and two part-time jobs to pay her bills, but she was in her late 50s and so very tired. She had cut all creature comforts out of her budget, which had allowed her to drop one part-time job, but then her car was stolen and her insurance company refused to cover its replacement value. She had to take back that second part-time job to get a new car. Poilievre then referenced Liberal political machinations around the resignation of Trudeau's ally Chrystia Freeland. ""These silly games over here are very entertaining, as is the soap opera that everyone is seized with today. That is all fine, but there are real people whose lives are on the line. We have a duty to work for them. Quite frankly, this woman does not see me or any of us as any kind of saviour. They see us all as a last hope. In fact, she does not want to be saved; she just wants her life back. She was taking care of herself just fine before her tax, her heat and her grocery bill went through the roof and her car went missing. She was doing everything right."" Poilievre mentioned a Labatt brewery worker who worked three jobs to make enough to pay rent and care for his family. ""They can barely make it. He said to me that he feels ashamed when he talks to his kids because they ask why he is never around and why they can never have a house. He feels like a failure. He did not fail. He has been failed. He has been robbed of the promise of Canada. It was a very simple promise: If we worked hard, we got a good life ... ""Politicians break promises all the time, but do we know what was bad about this promise? This promise did not belong to the prime minister. It was not his promise to break. It belonged to all of us. Our purpose is to bring home that promise for that young man, that young father, and that older female worker, so that they can take back control of their lives once again."" The record low out of 44 federal elections for the Liberals was 11 per cent of the vote in 2011. With a new leader, maybe they'll be higher than that. With Trudeau, the bottom is the limit.","Edmonton Journal; Edmonton, Alta.","Edmonton, Alta.","Staples, David",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 20, 2024",,,2024-12-20,Edmonton Journal

What is a provost? Malcolm Campbell is glad you asked,2024.0,"The first question most people have when they meet Malcolm Campbell is 'What is a provost?'The title of vice-president is clear, even though what falls under that umbrella may not be easily defined. Essentially, the sum total of the university's academic and operational functions falls to this CAO-like role. According to Google, here is what a provost might deal with: - Sets academic values, policies and practices and leads the university in academic planning. Manages the recruitment, hiring, retention and promotion of faculty. - Chairs the university's budget committee and makes resource decisions. - Assesses learning outcomes and effectiveness of academic programs. - Works to provide an outstanding student experience. - Drives research direction, creativity and innovation across departments. - Champions teaching, learning and interdisciplinary education. - Manages research enterprises and centres. - Allocates space for academic and research programs. The provost reports directly to the university president (in this case, Lynn Wells.) The provost works closely with deans, senior managers, faculty, and staff to ensure the university delivers on its promise of a quality education. Campbell also has to be very attentive to the recent history of Laurentian, its financial troubles, and pilot the organization through perhaps some still bumpy weather. ""I came from academia,"" he said. ""I had the great fortune of being raised by parents from very different backgrounds. My mum from a farming family on Prince Edward Island; my dad from a mining family in northern Quebec. They met in Montreal. My dad was in sales and my mum an academic administrator. As I grew up, I was encouraged towards both entrepreneurial and bookish routes. ""I ended up with very diverse interests. I applied to three universities and three very different programs: Carleton for journalism, U of T (University of Toronto) for English literature, and Guelph for biology. I did an undergraduate degree in genetics. Then as we had a baby, already I applied for grad school."" A biochemistry PhD took Campbell to the University of British Columbia in 1989. ""We loaded up the Oldsmobile my dad gave us and we moved cross-country,"" he recalled. ""As a runner and hiker, I loved the landscape. Mountain biking was great. ""I then worked on a large project in Europe (Toulouse, France) and our third child was born there. There I also got industrial experience combined with fundamental science. That led to North Carolina and work on issues in the forestry industry. ""How do you take a series of letters - A, C, G and T - and convert code into an organism? My work really focused on trees; specifically poplar trees for the pulp and paper industry. We were really interested in how lignin is made and the flow of water (and nutrients) in the plant. ""I got good at finding research monies. That landed me a job at Oxford in 1996. Eventually, we were repatriated to U of T."" When there was a reorganization of departments, Campbell took a leadership role. ""With formulating the new graduate program, I worked across all three U of T campuses, especially Scarborough. I worked at building consensus. I still had a lab and was research active."" Then he was called back to Guelph. ""We navigated well through the pandemic. From there I came here. I got to thinking about where I can make a difference ... making an impact. Laurentian was recruiting. I understand fiduciary responsibility."" Campbell talked about encouraging others -being in service to others -to help them realize their aspirations. ""I took the effort to become bilingual, plus a series of leadership courses,"" he said. Then there is finding funding, administrating that funding and creating outcomes and impact. ""I grasp sound financial management. I want to support colleagues and students. My whole first month was not having people coming to me but going to them. I needed to meet people where they are, in context."" Campbell added an interesting piece to the story of his awareness of Sudbury: ""I've had an amazing partner - Joan Ouellette -for 39 years. We met at Guelph. She actually grew up in Capreol."" Physically fit, Campbell covers at least nine km daily. ""I am an everyday runner. In races, I am a mid-pack runner, but I have done marathons. I cheer on my fellow competitors. When I cross the finish line, I turn around and encourage. I view the provostial role in the same way. ""How great is it to support others? I just celebrated my first 100 days. I hope to play a part in the healing process here. We have seen trauma. I want to see us restore hope, rebuild trust ... create a better future. ""The most powerful thing universities do is that they function as an insurance policy against the uncertainty of tomorrow. A university can function as a source for catalytic change; just look at the transformed Sudbury landscape today"" -a process that began with research conducted by Laurentian University academics.

Freeland's departure shows need for election: Poilievre; 'Out of control',2024.0,"Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre demanded on Monday that the government call an immediate election as the Liberals were thrown into chaos by high-profile resignations, saying there is no time to waste with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration just over a month away.

Controversies – and more importantly clicks – follow Clark deep into off-season,2024.0,"Though she bears no resemblance to him in style or content, Caitlin Clark has become the Donald Trump of sports. Everything she does or says makes someone angry. The people who are most reactive to her are her colleagues in the WNBA, all of whom stand to make more money because of her presence. Clark’s professional arrival could not be better timed in that regard. The league and players are currently negotiating a new collective agreement. Whatever additional monies flow from that – and there will be a waterfall of cash – should be referred to as the Clark Bump. But no good deed and all that. Clark’s latest misstep was trying to deflect some of the welldeserved credit that’s been sent her way. This past week, Time magazine made her its athlete of the year. That forced Clark to do the thing she likes least – a long, searching sit-down interview. In the feature that resulted, the issue of race was highlighted. For the most part, Clark has managed to avoid wandering into that minefield. In the piece, she is deferential to her Black predecessors, without being obsequious. “I want to say I’ve earned every single thing, but as a white person, there is privilege,” Clark said. It goes on like that with a lot of progressive boilerplate about appreciating and celebrating and highlighting. This sentiment is so middleof-the-road that it is tracing the median. It’s hard to imagine a statement less likely to provoke. But it’s Clark, so the alarms were sounded. Everyone to their podcasts! Launch the tweets! Fire the columns! The comments getting the most play came from Washington Mystics owner Sheila Johnson. She is unhappy that Time singled Clark out. “We have so much talent out there that has been unrecognized,” Johnson told CNN. “And I don’t think we can pin it on one player.” Yes, we can. That’s why they call it Athlete of the Year, and not Everyone of the Year. Nearly 50 years ago, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television with her then husband. They turned a niche cable channel into a multibillion-dollar business. All to say, she is an experienced campaigner. Yet here she is sounding like she just discovered there is a thing called media, and doesn’t understand why it can’t be nice to everyone. Johnson’s comments prompted Clark’s defenders to pile in, amplifying a debate spun from nothing. The WNBA just did what their male counterparts wish they could do more often – turn a made-up story into a real one. It’s at this point that I call shenanigans. I no longer believe that everyone in the WNBA is irritated by Clark, who is about the most anodyne great star in sports history. If she was strutting around picking fights, maybe. But this kid? She wouldn’t say boo to a goose. This is the person who upsets you so much? Nuh-uh. I refuse to accept it. Instead, I think that everybody in the WNBA – Clark, Johnson and everyone else – has reached an instinctive and unspoken consensus on what sells. For 20 years, the WNBA tried to break through by highlighting the abilities of its players. That didn’t work. People laughed at them. Worse, they ignored them. Incremental gains were being made, but advancing by increments in sports is like moving backward in any other business. It’s either boom or bust. Then Clark showed up. Coming out of college, she was the biggest thing ever. She’s gotten bigger since. To say she should be more deferential to her predecessors is a bit like saying Michael Jordan should never have done an interview without thanking Jerry West. It’s a nice thought, but let’s get real. Unlike most other newbies, Clark came packaged with a ready-made rivalry against LSU standout Angel Reese. The two have history going back to college. Clark is white and Reese is Black. Everyone in the WNBA must have noticed that Clark vs. Reese got mainstream outlets talking about the league like nothing before ever had. So instead of doing what it had always done – accentuating good vibes – the league embraced conflict. That the conflict was mostly made up didn’t matter. Soon, people had taken sides. Some think Clark’s the greatest. Some think she’s surfing on the accomplishments of others. Despite zero evidence to support the thesis, some think she’s a racist. Some think she’s a scapegoat. The truth of it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re interested. That’s brand new, and is plainly intoxicating to those who’ve been involved in the league for years. It’s why they can’t stop saying silly things. The trick is stoking this conflict just enough that it neither becomes an uncontrollable blaze nor gutters out. So far, so good. If they stick with the playbook here, we know how this should go. Eventually, Clark earns the grudging respect of her peers. They come to understand that despite superficial differences, they are all more alike than not. Maybe after years of animosity, Clark and Reese end up as respectful acquaintances. Not friends, exactly. That comes later. But valued colleagues. Maybe they become the Statler and Waldorf of sports. Bicker theatrically, go through contentfriendly tribulations and eventually play together. Maybe once it’s all over, they can do a documentary together. This show has been done before. They called it Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. That worked out pretty well for the two of them. It worked out even better for the NBA. The league’s modern brand is built on a white guy and a Black guy who strongly disliked each other until they were forced to talk. The players prospered and the league went stratospheric, but no one got more out of that racial conflict than the team owners. It took them from struggling multimillionaires to thriving billionaires. Were you in their spot today, I’m guessing that you too would go on CNN and say just about anything to keep the conversation bubbling.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Kelly, Cathal",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 16, 2024",,Nom: CNN; NAICS: 516210; Nom: Womens National Basketball Association; NAICS: 813990,2024-12-16,The Globe and Mail
N.B. musician Andrew Clark brings players together for Christmas album; Producer Paul Milner used virtual studio technology to include performances by musicians in different countries,2024.0,"Saint John musician Andrew Clark and producer Paul Milner used modern recording technology to bring a group of accomplished artists together for an album of original songs called ""Wake Me Up on Christmas Day."" Clark is an English-born Canadian citizen, singer-songwriter. Born in Derby, England, he trained as a doctor while learning to play various musical instruments, telling stories and writing songs since the age of 17. He lived in Newfoundland and Halifax and played with many other musicians along the way, some of whom he was able to convince to play on his album. He plays guitar, banjo, ukulele, mandolin, Irish bouzouki, penny whistle and piano. Clark said this 12-song album has been in the works for more than two years and will soon be released to online music platforms and radio stations. A CD launch is planned for sometime in 2025. ""The album is all about Christmas and features an eclectic mix of my compositions ranging from a song about angels, a Nativity song, a song about family and Christmas, one about Santa, a rock song about Ebenezer Scrooge, and then an old arrangement of the classic 'Auld Lang Syne,'"" Clark said. The album features guest musicians from Canada, the United States and Italy, performing their own contributions remotely to Paul Milner's Trillium House Studio in Saint John. It started out with basic guitar and vocal tracks, and then they went out looking for other musicians to contribute to it. He said the guest musicians include Tommy Emmanuel, J.P. Cormier, Muriel Anderson and Parker Hastings, the Chops Horns from New York, Kevin Fox, Italian guitarist Alberto Lombardi, and others. ""These are very experienced musicians who have been doing this for a long time and I'm lucky to have been able to contact them,"" Clark said. The title track, 'Wake me up on Christmas Day,'was written for Clark's father-in-law, who lost his wife a few years ago. He thought about how sad he would be waking up on Christmas morning without her, for the first time in 60 years. Clark said he wrote 'Cold, Cold Christmas'while living on the south coast of Newfoundland, thinking about fishermen out on the ocean on Christmas Day. The song 'Merry Christmas to You'was written during a trip to Disney World. The 'Angel Song'and 'Baby Jesus Mine,'are about the Nativity, while ""Christmas Angel"" has been released as a single on Internet radio stations across North America. Paul Milner, who operates the Trillium House Studio in Saint John, is a Juno-winning producer who has worked with such well-known artists as Keith Richards, Rush, Queensryche and Glass Tiger. Milner said he uses a program called We Transfer to e-mail music tracks to musicians around the world, creating a virtual studio environment. This technology got a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic when people weren't able to travel or gather in groups. ""I create a sub-mix for each instrument called stems,"" he said. ""We create stems for the song, with one for the drums, bass guitar, electric guitar, any other instruments, and the vocals. Those stems are then sent by e-mail to musicians around the world. They import them into a digital work station and then record their part against those that are already there, then export the file. ""They send it back to me and I bring it into my main recording unit in the studio for final mixing,"" Milner said. ""There are also computer programs that allow musicians around the world to record together in real time and see them on video. Technology has changed the game. Essentially, anybody with a computer and the software has a recording studio at their fingertips.""","Telegraph-Journal; Saint John, N.B.","Saint John, N.B.","Cochrane, Alan",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 14, 2024",Musical instruments; Radio stations; Musicians & conductors; Musical performances; Christmas,,2024-12-14,Telegraph-Journal
21-member PC cabinet sworn in; Private ceremony staged at convention centre,2024.0,"Premier Tim Houston and his 21-member Progressive Conservative cabinet were sworn in Thursday at the Halifax Convention Centre. In the ceremony presided over by Lt .-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc, Houston said the larger cabinet was ""designed to drive growth and prosperity so our province can continue to flourish."" In 2021, Houston's cabinet featured 19 members. Notably absent from the swearing-in ceremony was the media, as the government cited space issues at the convention centre. A Communications Nova Scotia news release on Wednesday stated, ""Capacity is limited, and the event is not open to the media.""

"In a defining year for women's sport, clark led the way; No other athlete had such an individual impact on their games and businesses",2024.0,"The most significant game-changing, sport-changing athlete of 2024 was paid US$76,535 in salary - nothing like Juan Soto money - to play basketball for the Indiana Fever. Really, there's never been an athlete in any sport, at any time, who has altered the landscape the way Caitlin Clark did in 2024. The year women's professional sports - and maybe women's sport in general - changed forever. That this gangly, Iowa-born, aw-shucks, almost Gretzky-like basketball savant could fascinate the public and carry the money loser that has been the WNBA into near mainstream status is beyond illogical. But it happened, in the same year that teenager Summer McIntosh dazzled global audiences with her accolades in Paris, in the same year that the Professional Women's Hockey League opened in North America and began to flourish, in the same year that the Northern Super (soccer) League announced its arrival in Canada. There have been other game changing athletes in other years. Tiger Woods was one in golf. That didn't happen immediately. Mike Tyson had that effect years after Muhammad Ali in boxing. Also neither happened overnight. The Big Three in tennis became an acquired taste. But not even the Michael Jordans or the Steph Curry; the Gretzkys or the Mario Lemieuxs; the Patrick Mahomes or the Tom Bradys have had the singular individual impact to their games and to their businesses the way it has all come together with Clark. In a recent Indianapolis Star article, she was deemed to have been responsible for 26.5 per cent of all WNBA business. One player. Television audiences in the WNBA were up 300 per cent this season in the U.S. and 45 per cent of that audience was attributed to Indiana Fever games. WNBA merchandise sales grew by 500 per cent.

The new television deal the WNBA has signed will pay it US$200 million, which is three times more than they were paid in the contract that is about to expire. Before Clark played her first WNBA game, her legend had already begun. Her four years at Iowa University were mammoth. The 2024 NCAA tournament - the women's tournament tends to get a public shrug when compared to that of the men's tourney - was the most watched ever on American television. Clark played in that event, then played in the most watched WNBA season, for the most watched team in history, the Fever. In between all that, she signed all kinds of corporate marketing deals with Nike and Wilson and others that will pay her the kind of life-changing money that WNBA players tend not to attract. In fact, the rookie contract she signed with the Fever, which is a standard entry level deal by the Players'Association, will average out to $84,514 over four seasons. On a dollar-for-dollar scale, she has already become sport's most underpaid player. The PWHL, with three Canadian teams and three American teams, and looking to expand next year, doesn't have a Caitlin Clark. It is hard to sell individual hockey players the way you can sell basketball players. Individually, basketball players impact games far more significantly than single hockey players do. They will play upwards of 35 minutes of a 40 minute game. A great hockey player plays 20-some-minutes of a 60-minute game. A great basketball player is easily visible - we see their faces, their expressions, their emotions, their human frailties. A hockey player plays beneath a helmet and a face mask. We see their faces only in interviews. In its second season, the PWHL needs breakout stars, needs someone who can do something even similar to what Clark has managed in her first WNBA season, a player to relate to, a player to become ours. The way Wayne Gretzky was able to do that becoming a breakout star in the NHL, when he dominated scoring in the 1980s the way no one had dominated before. Gretzky was traded from Edmonton to Los Angeles and the NHL changed forever.

Councillor nominated as PC candidate in Carleton,2024.0,"Osgoode ward Coun. George Darouze has been nominated as the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario's candidate for Carleton in the next provincial election. ""I am extremely honoured to announce that I am officially the PC Party of Ontario candidate for the riding of Carleton, with a landslide victory winning 96% of the vote,"" Darouze wrote Dec. 8 on Facebook. Premier Doug Ford commented on the nomination in a Dec. 8 release from the party. ""George Darouze is a champion for the people of Carleton and a seasoned leader,"" Ford said. ""George's track record of advocating for better infrastructure, supporting local businesses, and delivering on community priorities makes him the ideal candidate to represent Carleton. I'm excited to have him on our team as we continue to build a stronger Ontario."" Darouze has represented Osgoode for three terms, since 2014, hanging on to the rural ward in the 2022 election by a mere 238 votes. In the PC release, the party said Darouze ""brings years of proven leadership and a strong commitment to his community. As a current Ottawa City Councillor, he has consistently worked to enhance rural and suburban life, improve infrastructure, and deliver results for Carleton residents. From his work in community safety to advocating for better public services, George's dedication to his constituents is unwavering."" The announcement came amid speculation that Ford could call an early spring election. Goldie Ghamari represents the Carleton riding, but Ford kicked her out of the Progressive Conservative caucus in late June after what he called repeated and serious lapses in judgment. Shortly before that, Ghamari had taken a virtual meeting with Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the far-right English Defence League. After Ghamari posted on social media about the meeting, the National Council of Canadian Muslims called Robinson an Islamophobe and urged Ford to remove Ghamari from his caucus. Ghamari still holds a seat in the legislature as an independent.","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 11, 2024",Provincial elections; Nominations; Leadership; Election results; Social networks,,2024-12-11,The Ottawa Citizen

Clark calls for singlepermit ATV trail system,2024.0,"Local MPP Steve Clark has tabled a motion calling for a single-permit all-terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system across Ontario. The motion is scheduled to be debated at Queen's Park on March 4, 2025. In a Member's Statement last week, Clark, the MPP for Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, said his motion follows a trail tour he did with members of the Thousand Islands and Johnstown ATV Clubs, and the Ontario Federation of All-Terrain Vehicle Clubs (OFATV) earlier in the fall. ""I saw the passion riders have for maintaining trails, their respect for property owners, how they support small businesses, and raise funds for community groups,"" said Clark. ""But they told me there is so much more potential for ATV'ing. The missing piece is what exists for Ontario's 30,000 kilometres of snowmobile trails: a one-permit trail system. This would allow users - whether from Ontario or from beyond - to purchase one annual pass to access thousands of kilometres of trails,"" said Clark. The MPP said a one-permit trail system is supported by the majority of ATV clubs in Ontario, including the Johnstown and Thousand Islands clubs, but his motion provides the ability for individual clubs to opt out. Ontario is the country's second-largest province for ATV use, with more than 300,000 insured vehicles, however, it is the only province without some sort of comprehensive trail permit system in place, added Clark. He said a single-permit system would simplify the process for ATV riders from across Ontario and beyond to get access to trails, and would create a source of revenue that could be used to enhance trail systems. ""These investments will increase rider safety and the responsible use of trails, which is a benefit to property owners and municipalities,"" Clark added in a prepared statement. The OFATV welcomed the move. ""By working with industry to implement a unified system, the government of Ontario will position this expanding sector for exponential growth, benefiting riders, individual clubs, and local economies throughout the province,"" said the organization's executive director, Shari Black, in a prepared statement of her own. ""OFATV applauds the initiative of MPP Clark for raising this motion, and eagerly awaits a government decision on the matter. Our team is more than willing to be an active partner in informing, designing, implementing, and operating a unified trail system.""

"For Poilievre, politics trumps unity on tariffs; Sunday Op-Ed; Conservative leader's rhetoric after Trudeau's sit-down with Donald Trump can only hurt his almost-certain win in the next federal election",2024.0,"Pierre Poilievre can see his Christmas present, an election victory, perfectly gift-wrapped sitting right there under the tree. After nine years under a Liberal government - which has struggled through complicated economic times and in delivering basic federal services to Canadians - polls show a decisive Conservative election victory is there for the taking. But if Poilievre wants to ultimately open his gift, he shouldn't be trying to grab it too hastily or too greedily. He must start being more careful in showing that his preoccupation is first and foremost the best interests of Canadians and not his own electoral fortunes. His actions of the past week don't help that perception. Despite his poll numbers, many Canadians are having trouble warming to Poilievre himself. He appears snarky and sarcastic at times, rhyming off slogans and unduly focused on blaming Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for everything, rather than offering tangible solutions for the future. Highlighting government shortcomings succeeds in consolidating support between elections and from those who are staunch detractors of the incumbent. During a campaign, however, the light shines much more brightly on the main contenders. To maintain or expand his base, Poilievre will have to start acting more statesmanlike and try to temper his overt partisanship. In response to Donald Trump's boisterous threat about slapping 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports, which would devastate our economy, Trudeau was able to quickly score a face-to-face dinner with the U.S. president-elect to discuss the situation. In his reaction to Trudeau's meeting, Poilievre appeared somewhat shell-shocked. He went on - robotically, it seemed - that Trudeau had come back empty-handed and hadn't made any gains, adding that Trudeau is a weak prime minister who's lost control of border security, immigration, crime, drugs and our economy. Trudeau's meeting with Trump was a first step. It could turn out to be a major victory if he somehow succeeds in having Trump back off. If he fails and the tariffs fully materialize, it could be the last nail in the coffin for Trudeau's leadership. Poilievre's comments, however, seemed politically selfish and potentially reckless. He could have risen above partisan politics, as part of Team Canada, like the premiers, by offering his support to the prime minister in hoping for him to succeed on behalf of all Canadians. Instead, his comments trying to belittle Trudeau, who is negotiating on our behalf, compromise our position. It also places Poilievre himself in a lose-lose situation. Based on some of what we've heard from the meeting so far, it's already an uphill battle for Trudeau. His admission to Trump that the tariffs would cripple our economy prompted Trump's questionable comment about Canada ""ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion"" a year, joking (supposedly) that we should become the 51st state. If Trudeau fails, yes, it may benefit Poilievre's electoral fortunes, but to the severe detriment of our economy. And if Trudeau manages to succeed, Poilievre will reek of sour grapes compared to the impression he would have left had he taken a more statesmanlike position in multilateral support of his prime minister, acting in Canadians'best interests against an external threat. Also last week, after months of the Conservatives having paralyzed the House of Commons with a filibuster related to their demand for documents about alleged misspending of a now-defunct green technology fund, they announced intentions to proceed with more non-confidence motions to try to topple the minority Liberal government. The last thing Canadians probably want now before the holidays is for the government to fall and to be thrown into a divisive election. If Poilievre isn't more careful, he may end up ultimately returning the gift that Trudeau so neatly wrapped for him.

"Conservatives forced to blindly follow their leader, Sudbury MP says; 'What is happening in the CPC party is profoundly concerning'",2024.0,"I believe in this oft-cited maxim: Blind belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth. A CBC story broke last week about how Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) MPs are being tightly controlled by leader Pierre Poilievre. MPs told the CBC, ""Everybody is being watched. What we say, what we do, who we talk to."" Another MP said: ""The leader comes first."" The only thing that surprised me about the story is that it took so long to come out. The tension in the CPC party is palpable. We have witnessed the actions described in the article, including MPs being punished for doing the right thing or being forced to do or say things against their own values and better judgment. What is happening in the CPC party is profoundly concerning. It goes against the fundamental principles of how our parliamentary system works. The idea that ""the leader comes first"" should be rejected outright. The people of Sudbury elected me and they are the ones who come first for me in Ottawa. It is their needs I put first -always. Contrast that with what happened last week when Conservative MPs who had been advocating for their communities to receive housing funding were forced to withdraw their advocacy efforts. Poilievre's MPs described it as extremely frustrating. ""MPs are being stopped from helping their cities for partisan reasons. This is no time to play politics with housing,"" said one. It is important to note that all CPC MPs are required to follow the rules under Poilievre's leadership. Sudbury's CPC candidate would be forced to blindly follow the leader. What would this mean for Sudbury? Well, consider the more than $100 million in federal funding the city has received for housing. This funding has led to good-paying construction jobs and the creation of 500 new homes for people. Without your local MP advocating for this funding, it wouldn't happen. The consequences of leader-first thinking are on display daily in the House of Commons where CPC MPs are forced to vote against the best interests of their communities. For example, CPC MPs were forced to unanimously vote against sending much-needed military support to the people of Ukraine. Some of those MPs have large Ukrainian communities in their riding, just like Sudbury does, and they care deeply about the ongoing war. MPs are also forced to endlessly, even childishly, chant slogans in the House of Commons instead of raising important issues for their communities. CPC MPs describe a point system, where the more often they recite Poilievre's slogans, the more time they are allotted in the House of Commons. But even then, they must recite the slogans in the questions they ask or in the debates they make on the floor of the House of Commons. Poilievre is running to be the next prime minister of Canada. Under his autocratic leadership, one wonders who he would select to be his cabinet ministers and whether they would be allowed to perform their duties. Would the minister of Labour be allowed to give voice to the protection of workers against the Conservative party's big corporate donors? Would his Environment Minister be required to back the interests of Pierre's oil and gas supporters to the detriment of our fragile, threatened environment? CPC members say they are censured by a leader who claims he will make Canada ""the freest country in the world."" What is free about a country in which represented leaders cannot stand and be heard? One thing I know is that my party is at its best when we connect with our communities. It is those connections that drive what we do. It is unfortunate that my CPC colleagues cannot say the same.

"Indigenous deaths spark call for policing inquiry; 'System itself needs to change'following fatalities in Campbell River, Prince George",2024.0,"First Nations have called for a national inquiry into ""systemic"" racism in policing after a mounting death toll in interactions with police in the past decade, including high-profile cases in B.C. The Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution Tuesday at its special chiefs assembly in Ottawa calling for the national inquiry, and held a news conference to answer questions on Wednesday. Speaking at the news conference, Terry Teegee, the regional chief of the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, pointed to the deaths in the province of Jared Lowndes in 2021 and Dale Culver in 2017 after interactions with Mounties, and the death of Everett Patrick in 2020 in his cell in RCMP custody. Teegee noted that Patrick was a relative of his. There have been a spate of Indigenous deaths in interactions with police this year across Canada, including six in a two-week span in August and September, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick. ""The list goes on and on. And it must stop,"" said Teegee. ""It's really important that this is highlighted at the highest level. There needs to be systemic change in policing. Not only for First Nations peoples, but the system itself needs to change."" The AFN resolution maintained that despite 20 individual inquiries and commissions into the police and justice system since 1989, the federal government has failed to make substantive changes to address systemic racism within the RCMP and other agencies. The resolution also called for the demilitarization of police forces and the establishment of a national intervention team across Canada that can support people in crisis. In an interview, Teegee said the inquiry needs to examine how to rebuild a ""broken"" policing system where too many interactions with police end in violence. It also needs to examine how more First Nations can police themselves and how to incorporate different approaches that include the use of mental-health specialists, for example, on calls such as wellness checks. Teegee noted that Indigenous Peoples have a long history of poor relationships with police, including with the RCMP, a force that helped take children away to residential schools. He noted that, in his language, the word for police is ""those who take us away."" Lowndes, 38, from the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in northwest B.C., was killed in an RCMP shooting that took place at a Tim Hortons in Campbell River on July 8, 2021. Culver, of the Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Nations, died in police custody after being arrested by Mounties in Prince George on July 18, 2017. Patrick, from the Lake Babine Nation, was arrested after a breakand-enter at a sporting good store in April 2020 in Prince George. He was medically cleared at a hospital, before being brought to jail cells in Prince George, where he was later found in medical distress. The B.C. Prosecution Service didn't file charges in the Lowndes and Patrick cases, and has stayed almost all charges in the Culver case. In all three cases, B.C.'s Independent Investigation Office, which probes deaths resulting from use of force by police, had found that there were grounds to believe an officer may have committed an offence and sent reports to the prosecution service asking for charges. AFN National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak said she wants all federal political parties to support the inquiry. She said she has had discussions on the need for policing reform with both the federal Liberals and the Conservatives, including with leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is expected to win next year's federal election. In a statement, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc's office said the RCMP is co-operating with independent police oversight bodies that are looking into the deaths. ""We recognize that recent officer-involved fatal incidents in Indigenous communities have been incredibly difficult for community members, and most of all the loved ones of the deceased. Our thoughts are with them,"" the statement said. - with Canadian Press files ghoekstra@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Hoekstra, Gordon",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 5, 2024",Press conferences; Fatalities; Native North Americans,,2024-12-05,The Vancouver Sun
Poilievre dares Freeland to reveal 'true number'of the budget deficit; Economy; Finance minister pressed to table fall statement,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is challenging Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland to table her fall economic statement after she accused him of delaying the process. ""We'll give her two hours out of our Conservative opposition motion day on Monday for her to stand on her feet and tell us how much she's lost control of the nation's finances,"" said Poilievre on Wednesday. Poilievre's comments come after the minister suggested Tuesday afternoon that the government was ""keen to deliver an economic statement in the fall"" but has been unable to do so because the Conservatives are filibustering the House of Commons with a question of privilege. ""That has real consequences in terms of the government's ability to do the work that we need to do for Canadians,"" said Freeland during a news conference. The government is not required to present an economic statement to the House of Commons, and for many years the previous Conservative government presented it outside of Parliament. But Freeland was clear about her intention to continue her habit of introducing it on the floor of the House of Commons ""where the work of Parliament is done."" In October, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux Poilievre said the delay suggested the minister may be hiding the real numbers, pointing to Freeland's commitment to a $40-billion cap on the federal government's deficit. ""Why won't the finance minister tell us the true number? What's she hiding? Is she hiding that Trudeau lost control of the deficit this year, just like every year?"" he asked. ""Maybe they're fighting over how big and out of control the deficit actually is. Once again, such a fight said his analysis showed that the government ""will not meet its fiscal commitment"" to keep the deficit below $40 billion, and that it had reached $46.8 billion in 2023-2024. ""We'll present a full fiscal picture when we present the fall economic statement,"" she said, insisting that it would be presented in the fall, which means it would have to be tabled before Dec. 21. would be a loss of control by the prime minister,"" he added. Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet believes that the problem lies elsewhere. ""I have the impression that the government does not currently have a complete, real and credible reading of the economic situation,"" he suggested on Parliament Hill. Minutes after Poilievre reached out, government House leader Karina Gould appeared surprised by the gesture. ""Oh, OK, I'll have to think about it,"" she said before entering the Liberal caucus meeting. She quickly added that the Conservatives should end their two-month filibuster rather than offer a few hours here and there. Meanwhile, Treasury Board President Anita Anand dismissed the idea that Freeland would ""respond"" to Pierre Poilievre's request for a fall economic statement. ""I don't think that Pierre Poilievre offer is going to be what moves her to present her financial update and the fall economic statement to Canadians. She's working hard on it, and she'll do it when she's ready,"" Anand said. Poilievre said Conservatives will be ready to clear some time for Freeland if she accepts the offer. ""So the challenge is over to Chrystia Freeland and Justin Trudeau. Stand on your feet Monday at 4 p.m. We'll clear the deck, so you can do it and tell us how badly you've lost control of the nation's finances,"" he said.

"Holt's HST stance 'doesn't sound like a good deal to me': Savoie; 'Double hit' coming to New Brunswick, interim PC leader warns",2024.0,"Spending provincial money on projects and programs jointly funded by New Brunswick and the feds in a bid to recoup HST revenue lost from Ottawa's temporary tax holiday would be a big mistake, according to interim Progressive Conservative Leader Glen Savoie. Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a tax holiday on a range of products including beer, wine, restaurant meals, diapers, and children's clothing. The holiday begins on Dec. 14., and will run for two months. The feds have confirmed it means the entire HST will be removed in New Brunswick, as Ottawa collects both the provincial and federal sales tax together. It means a 15 per cent break for New Brunswickers, and an estimated $62-million hit to the province's coffers. Initially, Premier Susan Holt said she expected Ottawa to make up that shortfall. But on Monday night, she suggested the province might be compensated in other ways. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Saint John, Holt said her government is ""in constant conversation with the feds about how they can make it up to us."" ""Those conversations are going well,"" Holt said. ""They're really keen to come to New Brunswick these days and to come and try to get photo shoots with every member of my team and make announcements and we're keen to get every last drop of federal investment that we can, while we can, for the benefit of New Brunswickers."" On Tuesday, Savoie poured cold water on the idea, noting that the feds usually require provinces to chip in on any new projects or programs. ""I find that very sad because those HST revenues were revenues from people spending money in our province, that the federal government would remit back to us,"" Savoie said. ""What the premier is talking about is us spending even more money to get money from the feds for projects or for other issues. ""So here we've got revenues that rightly belong to us, that we are foregoing, and the trade-off is supposed to be that we're going to get 50-cent dollars in return on projects. Doesn't sound like a very good deal to me."" Holt is learning a harsh lesson early in her mandate, Savoie said. ""We're going to lose tax revenue, and then somehow we're supposed to do better because we're going to spend 50-cent dollars on programs that the federal government is going to make available to us?"" Savoie asked. ""It's a double hit and I would question ... how many of these programs will we actually need? What benefit will we actually get for the 50-cent dollars that we're going to have to spend that are supposed to replace dollars that were rightfully ours to begin with?""

What does that mean? Dec. 1 The reaction from president-elect Donald Trump regarding Hunter Biden's pardon was predictable. Himself a convicted felon, Trump is preparing to pardon criminals convicted of crimes committed during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection once he takes office. A man who has told a plethora of lies is pointing his finger as he looks down his nose, which grew an immeasurable length during the presidential campaign. One standard for Joe, another for Donald. Julia Bowkun, Toronto Poilievre should offer solutions Poilievre accuses Trudeau of coming home empty-handed after Trump, PM hail 'productive' Florida meeting, Dec. 2 Pierre Poilievre should be ashamed of himself. He is not fit to be leader of the Conservative party. So far, he has only offered criticisms and silly slogans and they have become tiresome. As leader of the opposition his role is to criticize but he should, at least occasionally, offer a solution. Canada has a potential problem in Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Justin Trudeau is attempting to get the premiers onside to project a unified front on the tariff issue. He even took the initiative of meeting with Trump. This would have been an opportunity for Poilievre to show some statesmanship and support the prime minister in his efforts to avoid the punitive tariffs. Instead he called him weak and incapable of dealing with Trump. That shows that Poilievre puts a shot at political gain over the national interest and, in my mind, makes him unfit for his roles as a party leader and leader of the opposition. Gordon Simpson, Toronto Where's the affordable housing? Will a rebuilt Golden Mile be a thriving neighbourhood? That might be up to our kids, Dec. 1 While the plan for a new community of 56,000 residents is exciting and important city-building, it is also a boon to the developers securing increased density at the Planning Tribunal. I'm still combing the article for any mention of how many of the new units will be required to be ""affordable."" Surely, in the midst of the housing crisis, the settlements should mandate developers to provide a meaningful percentage of units at below-market rates, in purpose-built rental formats for extended periods of time, including partnerships with non-profits. Victor Doyle, Toronto Private sector can handle mail Postal strike a difficult yet necessary labour disruption, Dec. 3 I totally agree with letter writer Mr. Palansky that snail mail is almost obsolete. The longer this strike lasts, the more Canadians will realize we do not need Canada Post and its entitled workers. The private sector can offer a much more efficient service at a much lower cost. Private companies who handle parcel services could also handle letters. The bulk of physical mail today comes from flyers, which are also becoming obsolete as merchants prefer online flyers. Postal workers should be thankful they have a job at all. Claude Gannon, Markham Leading Ontario down wrong path Ontario spent highest-ever amount on government ads, auditor says, Dec. 3 As a senior who has lived in Oshawa my entire life I am appalled at the current provincial government. I am muting the television when Premier Doug Ford's ads come on. Who pays for these ads? I have been in gas stations and watched people buying a couple of cans of beer at 8 a.m. I don't think they are keeping them until they get home at night. A clerk in one told me their busiest time for alcohol sales is 7 to 9 a.m. Our premier's desire to be the King of Toronto is annoying to everyone; the rest of the province can sink or swim. The list goes on. Cancelling a great revenue maker in licence plate stickers was ridiculous. But I guess he got a few votes. And I imagine he will win in a landslide next time, fuelled by his $200 bribe. People are literally dying for medical tests or to see a doctor. Food banks are overwhelmed. Just imagine what could have been done with that licence sticker money and those $200 ""rebate cheques."" If he is elected for four more years there will be more ridiculous spending. Fellow Ontarians, please look at the bigger picture. Patricia Holland, Oshawa Many students are struggling 'They do what they want when they want': Ontario students became ruder in class after the pandemic, study suggests, Nov. 8 No one is talking about lingering post-pandemic issues. It's as if we moved on and don't want to look back. But, unfortunately, our kids don't have that privilege. They lost three years of their lives and as a result are behind in their education. But the government hasn't put additional supports in place to get them caught up, our teachers are struggling and our kids are failing grades, especially kids who had Individual Education Plans. My son is 18 and has an Individual Education Plan. The pandemic hit him hard, as resources were not available. Those resources are not available now. We will see the effect of this for years to come. Mary Hart, Toronto Border issues aren't one-sided Trump says he had a 'productive meeting' with Trudeau after leaders met for surprise dinner in Florida, Dec. 1 So the Trudeau-Trump meeting, in the president-elect's view, was not just a fine feed spoiled by tedious talk. Less than clear is how Canada alone can stop the flow of fentanyl, which Trump himself blames on the cartels and China. But let's all hope Canada does its part to help eliminate what Trump rightly terms a ""terrible devastation of U.S. families."" And while we're on the topic of foreign-caused devastation of families, how about our feds ask the U.S. to put an end to the tsunami of illegal American guns flooding into Canada? Studies say more than 85 per cent of guns used in crimes here are smuggled from down south. According to Statistics Canada, from 2019 to 2023, illegal American guns were used in the deaths of approximately 251 Canadians every year. That's a lot of devastated families too, wouldn't you say Mr. Trump?

HARPER GRANTED PERMISSION TO PROROGUE PARLIAMENT,2024.0,"People who care about such things still debate the prorogation of 2008. An overconfident minority Conservative government, fresh off its second election win, refused to run deficits to counter a worsening recession – but did cut funding for political parties in its economic statement. Furious, Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion and NDP Leader Jack Layton, supported by the Bloc Québécois, agreed to defeat the Conservatives and form a coalition government. To stop them, Stephen Harper asked Governor-General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue Parliament for several weeks, to let tempers cool and allow the government to prepare a budget replete with a huge deficit.

"Temporary supportive housing opens in Campbell River, near site of former tent city",2024.0,"Times Colonist A 40-unit supportive-housing facility in Campbell River is up and running not far from a municipal park that used to host a tent encampment. The temporary Homewood facility is a short walk from Nunn Creek Park, where overnight encampments were removed by the city several times last year. Residents began moving into the five prefabricated eightplexes at 1299 Homewood Rd. on Nov. 21. The complex has on-site washrooms, showers, laundry and a dining hall operated by the Lookout Housing and Health Society. It has an annual operating fund of about $1.8 million from the province. The organization is providing around-the-clock on-site staffing, as well as daily meals, skills training and other services for residents. People who have stayed in local shelters and encampments and have lived in the Campbell River area for at least two years will have priority for shelter at the site. The property at 1299 Homewood Rd. is owned by the City of Campbell River, which is leasing the land to the province for a nominal fee. The city funded all civil works and site preparation costs, while the buildings were built by B.C. Housing for about $2.4 million. The project is expected to operate for three years while the province, B.C. Housing and city build more permanent supportive-housing facilities in the region. In a statement announcing Homewood's opening, Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon said the homes would allow people sheltering outdoors to access supports to stabilize their lives. Campbell River Mayor Kermit Dahl said Homewood represents an important step in addressing homelessness in the city. ""Providing safe housing options and support services for people experiencing homelessness is one way Campbell River city council is enhancing health and safety for all residents,"" he said in a statement. When the facility was first announced in February, Dahl said he hoped the pre-fabricated facility would be operating as early as May 1. Homewood was originally named HEARTH Village, after the province's HEARTH program, which stands for Homeless Encampment Action Response Temporary Housing program. A point-in-time count conducted in the city last year found 197 people in Campbell River were experiencing homelessness, up from 116 in 2021. mjlo@timescolonist.com","Times - Colonist; Victoria, B.C.","Victoria, B.C.","Lo, Michael John",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 3, 2024",Homeless people,,2024-12-03,Times - Colonist
Configuration of N.S. legislative chamber will change with large PC majority,2024.0,"The massive sweep by the Tim Houston-led Progressive Conservatives in Nova Scotia's election last week has likely led to minor headaches for both the party and legislature officials. ""Similar to what the House of Commons does if you have too many government members, or for that matter too many opposition members, to all fit on one side of the House,"" said James Charlton, chief clerk of the Nova Scotia legislature. ""You have what is referred to as a rump on the other side,"" Charlton said. ""It's a continuation of the government or the opposition caucus. An example of when you would have an opposition rump on the government side would be the 1998 (Nova Scotia) election when there would have been 19 Liberals, 19 NDP and 14 PCs."" Liberal Russell MacLellan had taken over as Liberal premier in 1997 from John Savage, who was elected in a landslide 1993 victory but lost significant political traction through cuts to the province's health and education systems and the imposition of the 15 per cent HST to merge the provincial sales tax with the federal goods and service tax. MacLellan took provincial voters to the polls in March 1998 but gained only 19 of the 52 seats, well shy of the 27 required to form a majority government. NDP Leader Robert Chisholm and his party also picked up 19 seats and the Progressive Conservatives claimed 14. The disconfigured House returned to normal 16 months later when the fragile Liberal government was replaced by a majority PC government with John Hamm as premier. ""We do have a couple of occasions in the past, for example, if you look back at 1984 or 1993 when there were very large majorities under John Buchanan and John Savage, where there were 40 or more members of the government caucus and they had a number of members seated on the other side of the House,"" Charlton said. ""The practice that we follow, very similar to the House of Commons, is basically we go to the government caucus first and ask them to determine their seating arrangements, pick where they want to sit and they'll fill up the government benches first, and then if necessary they'll move over and take up some of the opposition space,"" he said. ""The convention is that if there is a government rump they sit closest to the Speaker. They'll take over some of the benches, and we also sort of follow a bit of a convention that you're entitled to the same percentage of front-bench seats as the percentage of seats you hold."" The overflow of PC caucus members, then, won't be stuck in the back row of the opposition benches. ""They will be in several columns coming down from the Speaker so they'll have some front-bench S seats and fan back from that."" Charlton said that from there it goes to the official opposition, in this case the NDP with nine seats, to select their seats and then to the third party, the Liberals with two seats, and then the independent, Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin of Cumberland North, gets slotted in wherever there is space. The PC rump is considerable. The party roared to a second consecutive majority by electing 43 members, the most seats won by a single party in the history of the Nova Scotia legislature. There have been 55 seats in the House since 2021 so the PC seat haul in Tuesday's election in winning 78 per cent of the seats does not constitute the highest percentage of seats ever won in a Nova Scotia provincial election. That bragging right goes to the Liberal party in each of the 1867 and 1901 elections which won 36 of the 38 seats for 94.7 per cent of the seats. The Conservatives took 40 of 43 seats in 1916 for victory in 93 per cent of the seats. Houston and the PCs will likely not have to worry about the rump configuration until sometime before the legislature sits again, likely in spring. But the minor, although probably welcome, headache for the PC leader will be to immediately decide on cabinet choices before the new government is sworn in within the next couple of weeks. Tim Houston and his giant band of MLAs, as Opposition Leader Claudia Chender described the 43-member PC caucus on election night, includes Houston and 16 other re-elected cabinet ministers. Notably absent is a finance minister as Allan MacMaster, the Inverness MLA who held the finance portfolio since 2021 and had been deputy premier, announced just before the provincial election that he was resigning his cabinet post to seek the Conservative nomination in the federal riding of Cape Breton-Canso-Antigonish in the next federal election.","Chronicle - Herald; Halifax, N.S.","Halifax, N.S.","Campbell, Francis",CNW Group Ltd.,"Dec 3, 2024",Provincial elections; Legislatures,,2024-12-03,Chronicle - Herald
Poilievre slams Trudeau over meeting with Trump,2024.0,"As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. president-elect Donald Trump hail their surprise meeting in Florida on Friday night as ""productive,"" federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Trudeau came home empty-handed for Canada. Poilievre made the comment Sunday in response to a reporter's question about the Trudeau-Trump three-hour dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. The pair talked cross-border issues including Trump's threat to slap massive 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian products being imported into the U.S. ""While I'm a critic of Mr. Trudeau's, I did feel badly that he went in with such a position of weakness,"" the Conservative leader said. ""Normally when a prime minister goes to the United States to meet a president they're looking to make gains. What gains did we hear from Mr. Trudeau? None."" Trump posted on social media that he had ""a very productive meeting"" with Trudeau and ""made it very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic."" Trump, who is announcing appointments and other moves to prepare for his Jan. 20 return to the White House, added that ""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families."" Trudeau - whom sources told the Star initiated the visit that included Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc and advisers, as well Trump's interior secretary and commerce secretary nominees, other advisers and their wives - also called the meeting ""productive"" and shared a photo of him and Trump together, both smiling. ""I look forward to the work we can do together, again,"" Trudeau posted. A spokesperson told the Star the pair ""shared a productive wide-ranging discussion over dinner (Friday) night, centred on collaboration and strengthening our relationship."" None of that was enough for Poilievre who suggested the prime minister should have flown home with substantial commitments or exemptions from the president-elect, who has not backed off his threat of import surcharges that would have a devastating impact on Canada's energy, auto and manufacturing exports. He contrasted the dinner talk with former prime minister Stephen Harper's cross-border negotiations on so-called ""Buy American"" protectionist policies and the 2012 Softwood Lumber Agreement, adding that Trudeau is ""a weak prime minister who's lost control of our borders, lost control of immigration, lost control of crime and drugs, and lost control of our economy."" During Sunday's press conference, Poilievre shared a number of demands for the Liberal government bolster the U.S.-Canada border - one the key asks in Trump's tariff threat - including measures to increase patrols and technology to crack down on illegal drug trafficking, as well as the tightening of visa rules and working with provincial law enforcement. He also said Canada should also cap the number of asylum seekers as it faces a significant influx in refugee claims. Ontario Premier Doug Ford had a more positive response to the meeting, posting on X that he was glad Trudeau went to Trump to learn more about the president-elect's concerns. ""Now we need the federal government to show us how they'll honour their commitment to all premiers to make our border more secure,"" said Ford. A source told the Star's Tonda MacCharles that Trudeau, Trump and their teams discussed trade, border security, fentanyl, defence matters including NATO, Ukraine and icebreakers (Canada, the U.S. and Finland recently agreed to a trilateral pact to rebuild their icebreaking fleets). Other topics on the table included China, energy issues and pipelines, including those that feed Canadian oil and gas into the U.S. like Keystone XL, Line 5, as well as the Trans-Mountain project and Canada's liquid natural gas export capacity. The leaders also discussed next year's G7 meeting, which Canada will chair in Kananaskis, Alta. It will be held seven years after Trump left the 2018 G7 at Charlevoix, Que., and called out Trudeau for making ""false statements"" in his opposition to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, the Star previously reported.

"Poilievre more 'in sync' with Trump, says Smith",2025.0,"On March 8, the American right-wing news site Breitbart published an interview with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith that barely made a ripple in Canada. In the interview, Smith blamed former prime minister Justin Trudeau for making Canada look weak in a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago after the U.S. vote. Smith made a comment that would resurface on the first day of the election campaign on Sunday. With the Liberals up in the polls after Trump's tariff threats, Smith told Breitbart she was urging the administration to pause tariffs as Canadians hold an election because ""it seems to be benefiting the Liberals. "" ... Because of what we see as unjust and unfair tariffs, it's actually caused an increase in the support for the Liberals ... Let's just put things on pause so we can get through an election,"" said Smith. Smith argued that Poilievre would be more ""in sync"" with the Trump administration. On Saturday, the eve of the writ drop, the interview resurfaced on social media. For Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, it was an unwelcome addition to questions from reporters on Sunday. He didn't address Smith's U.S. interview, but he did reference comments from Trump about his preference for a Liberal leader in Canada. ""My response is that the president has said that he thinks it would be easier to deal with a Liberal, and with good reason - the Liberals have weakened our country,"" said Poilievre in Gatineau, Que. Liberal Leader Mark Carney said at a news conference Sunday: ""With respect to the premier's comments, I take note of her alignment of Mr. Poilievre with Mr. Trump, and would note that that's one of the decisions that Canadians will have to make: whether they want a government that is unifying, that's standing up for Canada and is taking focused action to build a better economy, or they want division and Americanism.""","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Thomson, Stuart",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 24, 2025",Canada-US relations; Political campaigns; Tariffs,,2025-03-24,The Province
Poilievre promises he'll be 'respectful and firm' against Trump; Tory Kickoff,2025.0,"OTTAWA . Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre launched his campaign Sunday promising to deliver change, and contrasting himself to the man his Liberal opponents are expected to try and paint him as over the next 36 days: U.S. President Donald Trump. Appearing at the Museum of History across the river from Parliament Hill, Poilievre said he shares the anger and anxiety Canadians are feeling because of Trump's words and the current trade war Canada finds itself in with its closest ally.

That's what it means when I say let's put Canada first for a change."" Liberal Leader Mark Carney wasted no time arguing that Poilievre was stealing his policy ideas from Trump's administration. ""That's the choice for Canadians: a Canadian Trump or a government that unites the country and focuses on action in order to build a strong economy that works for all Canadians,"" said Carney, in French, at a news conference outside Rideau Hall on Sunday. Poilievre launched his campaign as public opinion polls show his two-and-a-half-year 20-point lead over the Liberals collapsing into a dead heat between the two parties, with concerns about the cost-of-living taking a back seat to Trump's tariffs and his comments about annexing Canada. The Conservative leader, who has spent the preceding months championing affordability issues, is now trying to thread the needle between voters' fears about threats coming from the U.S., and the economic situation Canada finds itself in. Asked about Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's comments made to the far-right outlet Breitbart, where she said Trump's trade war was helping the Liberals politically and that her message to administration officials was that Poilievre would be more aligned with its direction, Poilievre sidestepped her comments, instead referring to an interview Trump gave where the president said it would be easier to work with a Liberal in power. Trump is nonetheless expected to loom large over the campaign and, next week, the president's deadline for new tariffs on Canada will arrive. Poilievre spoke on Sunday about half an hour before Carney was scheduled to ask Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament and send Canadians to the polls next month. ""I will protect this country and put Canada first,"" said Poilievre, in a speech that excoriated the Liberal government's record of a ""lost decade."" Poilievre also used the speech to introduce himself to Canadians, explaining that he ""was born to a 16-year-old single mother who put me up for adoption to two school teachers."" Those ""humble beginnings"" gave him a sense of why Canada is special, said Poilievre. He appeared alongside his wife, Ana, along with their two children, Valentina and Cruz. He smiled and waved with his family, afterwards introducing his son to reporters as well as his stuffed toy penguin, whom Poilievre confirmed was named Penguin.

"Parties promise tax cuts but voters won’t be wowed easily:   Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre both promise tax cuts for the middle class, but Canadians may not be blown away by the actual amounts",2025.0,"Everybody’s got a tax cut. But does anyone have a wow factor? By day two of the election campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised a middle-class income-tax cut, targeted at the same demographic and the same tax bracket. Most Canadians will happily keep the money – a maximum of about $400 per person with the Liberal promise or about $900 with the Conservative proposal. Are you blown away by what it means for you? Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre set the expectations high before the campaign started, insisting he would unveil ""massive"" tax cuts. This proposal is a centrepiece of the Conservative campaign, and it’s a significant cut for many. It is more than double the Liberal’s promised cut. It’s pretty big. But it’s not massive. One dead giveaway that this cut is not quite as big as advertised is that the Conservatives felt the need to mislead voters about its size from the get-go. Mr. Poilievre announced it as a 15-per-cent cut to income taxes. But it will only cut the amount of federal taxes you pay by that proportion if you happen to earn the optimal amount: $57,375. Those who earn more, or less, would see their federal taxes cut by a smaller share. If you care about the details, both the Liberals and Conservatives are proposing to cut the tax rate paid on the first income bracket between $16,129 and $55,867. The Liberals would cut the rate to 14 per cent from 15 per cent, while the Conservatives would cut it to 12.75 per cent. Now the political question is whether voters think the difference between those tax cuts – a maximum of about $500 – means enough to them to swing their votes. A great deal of Mr. Poilievre’s campaign strategy is based on the belief that they will. There’s no question that many voters will find tax cuts appealing. But they also tend to discount politicians’ promises – that’s why some, such as Ontario Premier Doug Ford, have moved to send out cheques to individuals before the election, rather than promise the money will come later. There are, of course, always questions about who will get the tax breaks – and what will have to be cut to pay for them. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh immediately called both the Liberal and Conservative promises ""tax cuts for millionaires,"" which is a good political line but economically illiterate. He argued wealthier Canadians would receive the same amount of dollars as working folks. But a cut that saves millionaires the same $900 (or $400) as a worker who makes $60,000 isn’t particularly regressive. Mr. Singh said he will offer his own tax-cut proposal later – but he seems to be musing about GST cuts that would probably be more regressive. The bigger question is the cost to the treasury. Liberal Leader Mark Carney’s tax cut would lower revenues by $5.9-billion per year, and Mr. Poilievre’s by $14-billion. ""We can’t afford it,"" said Kevin Page, the president of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Democracy and former parliamentary budget officer. He noted that the federal government is already running deficits regularly above $40-billion per year, and although that’s not high compared with other countries, U.S. tariffs and a global slowdown could make things worse. Mr. Poilievre is promising a big tax cut, Mr. Page said, but not as extensive as the series of cuts that prime minister Jean Chrétien’s government laid out in its 2000 budget, after eliminating the budget deficit. In this case, Mr. Poilievre’s tax cuts would require spending cuts to avoid a far bigger deficit and the spending reductions. And the spending cuts Mr. Poiilievre has identified so far are relatively minuscule. He promised Monday he will spell them out – later. Politically, this is Mr. Poilievre’s big thing, so he had to go bigger than Mr. Carney. But the political problem with promising tax cuts is that any pledge to save people a few hundred dollars that applies to 25 million taxpayers is going to take an enormous amount of money out of government coffers. And even then, you can’t be sure voters will take note. So Mr. Poilievre made an expensive $14-billion promise. Will offering $500 more than Mr. Carney sway voters? Mr. Poilievre is gambling a lot of his campaign on it.

Did Danielle Smith lobby the U.S. to help Pierre Poilievre? Sure looks like it:   An interview with Breitbart reveals some troubling partisan actions taken by the Alberta Premier,2025.0,"When Alberta Premier Danielle Smith went down to Florida earlier this year for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, the mission was met with a fair degree of cynicism. It appeared she was off freelancing to negotiate her own sweet deal with Mr. Trump – in other words, when it came to tariffs, perhaps he could give Alberta oil and gas an exemption. It didn’t seem to be aligned with the ""Team Canada"" approach the country expected from its leaders. Ms. Smith, of course, insisted her overture to the President and meetings with other administration officials were on behalf of the entire country, not just her province. We were led to believe she was blind to the political allegiances of those she was helping back home. She was there for all of us! Well, maybe not so much. In a recent interview with the American right-wing news outlet Breitbart, the contents of which resurfaced on Sunday, Ms. Smith revealed what was truly going on during her missions south. In the on-air discussion, she expressed regret that the tariff issue had revived Liberal Party fortunes, at the expense of the federal Conservatives. She told the host that she feared the longer the tariff dispute dragged on, the better it would be for the Liberals. ""So, I would hope that we could put things on pause, is what I’ve told administration officials. Let’s just put things on pause so we can get through an election."" To recap: the tariff issue was helping the Liberals and hurting the Conservatives. She worried the longer it went on the better it would be for the Liberals. So, she urged U.S. administration officials to pause the tariff threat until after the election. Now, I don’t know about you, but that looks like a Canadian Premier asking a foreign government to do something to alter the outcome of an election campaign in order to help the party and the federal leader she supports. That’s the other thing, Ms. Smith told Breitbart: the perspective that Pierre Poilievre’s federal Conservatives bring, ""would be very much in sync with, I think, the new direction in America."" So, hold off on the tariff threat if you want a prime minister and a federal government more aligned with the views and philosophy of the Trump administration. Consider this hypothetical: If a provincial premier met with officials of the Communist Party of China, which was in the process of trying to destroy this country with brutal tariffs, and asked them to halt those economic threats until after a federal election campaign was over in order to better guarantee the result the premier was hoping for, there would be national outrage. Ms. Smith, not surprisingly, is disputing all this. Her press secretary, Sam Blackett, said that any suggestion she was trying to ask the U.S. to interfere in Canada’s election was ""offensive and false."" Well, people aren’t stupid and they can add things up for themselves. Her words are her words and she can’t now take them back. Look, it’s been clear for some time Ms. Smith doesn’t want Mark Carney and the Liberals to win. She recently met with the Liberal Leader in Edmonton and presented him with a long list of demands she said needed to be met within six months of his party forming government, should that be the outcome. Her demands are best summed up thusly: give me everything I want or I will make life as miserable as possible for you. Actually, she said if her terms aren’t met she will incite an ""unprecedented national unity crisis"" in this country. Her list includes unfettered access to build pipelines across the country and the removal of emissions caps on the oil-and-gas industry. (Pollute, baby, pollute). Oh, and one more burning issue: eliminate the prohibition of single-use plastics. Alberta wants its plastic straws back, or the country goes under. Ms. Smith said her laundry list of grievances and ultimatums applies to whichever party forms government. But we know these demands will be ripped up if Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives get in – they are effectively in a partnership. When Mr. Poilievre was asked about Ms. Smith’s stipulations, he said he had no problem with any of them. Of course he wouldn’t: It’s clear that he is Ms. Smith’s first choice for prime minister. It’s a really ugly situation when a sitting Premier is trying to insert herself into the outcome of a federal election the way Ms. Smith appears to be. It’s offensive and wrong. It’s certainly no way for a provincial leader in Canada to behave in the midst of a national crisis. In fact, it’s just the opposite.

"Mark Carney is offering voters the other guy’s ideas, without the other guy:   The Liberal Leader has adopted some of Pierre Poilievre’s best policy positions, minus the polarization",2025.0,"If the last near-decade has proven any adage true, it’s that the Liberals are terrible at governing, but exceptional at campaigning. Campaigns are when you get to announce things; governance is when you’re supposed to follow through. Unfortunately for Canada, the Trudeau Liberals conflated the former with the latter, behaving as if announcing a plan – a framework for a plan, a timeline for a framework for a plan – constituted actual action on a promise. But when the time came to ask Canadians for their support, the Liberals managed to gloss over their failings by promoting a message that worked: Andrew Scheer is a shadowy social conservative; Erin O’Toole is a flip-flopper who would kowtow to anti-vaxxers; and now, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre can’t be trusted to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump. The Liberals’ strategy at the outset of this campaign is a shrewd one: narrow the policy differences such that the election becomes one of competing impressions – a vote about who Canadians feel, in that mushy spot inside their tummies, would be better suited to represent Canada’s interests at home and abroad. To do so, Liberal Leader Mark Carney has adopted some of Mr. Poilievre’s best policy positions, but he offers them without the baggage, the smarm, the polarization that comes with the Conservative Leader. It’s the other guy’s ideas, without the other guy. Mr. Carney’s first action as Prime Minister was to ""axe"" the carbon tax, which had been Mr. Poilievre’s central refrain and promise if he was able to form government. Mr. Carney took that rallying cry and neutered it. Then he announced that his government would not move ahead with the planned hike to the capital-gains inclusion rate, which the Conservatives opposed last June and Mr. Poilievre said he would stop if he became prime minister. Mr. Carney met Mr. Poilievre’s promise of a tax cut by announcing his own (though Mr. Carney’s cut is less substantial: a 1-percentage-point reduction on the marginal tax rate for the lowest bracket, compared to Mr. Poilievre’s 2.25-percentage-point reduction) and has said he will eliminate federal duplication of provincial processes to expedite major project building, which is something that Mr. Poilievre has long said his government would do. Mr. Carney also repackaged one of Mr. Poilievre’s housing promises – no GST on homes under $1-million – though Mr. Poilievre’s pledge would apply to all buyers, whereas Mr. Carney’s would only be applicable to first-time homebuyers. There are still differences, obviously. Mr. Carney has said he will keep the emissions cap on oil and gas, for example, and we will likely see gaps emerge on topics like immigration, the war in Gaza and perhaps some social issues. But on the big stuff – income-tax cuts, infrastructure building, carbon taxes, housing, etc. – Mr. Carney and Mr. Poilievre appear generally aligned (which Conservatives and Liberals will both huffily protest is not true, alas). That works in Mr. Carney’s favour, and to Mr. Poilievre’s detriment. If there isn’t much daylight between the Liberal and Conservative policy approaches (daylight that is perceptible to the average voter, that is; I’m not sure how many normal people with busy lives know Mr. Carney has kept the carbon tax on industry), the campaign will be primarily focused on who appears to be the better leader. And at the moment, Mr. Carney easily wins that title. A recent Angus Reid poll asked Canadians which of the two leaders they believe would best handle a variety of issues, from ""the ‘trade wars’ between Canada and the United States,"" to ""Trump’s threat of annexation,"" ""relations between Ottawa and the provinces,"" and ""reducing the cost of living."" Mr. Carney swept the board; he polled higher on all of them. An Abacus poll showed more Canadians think of Mr. Carney as ""smart"" (61 per cent) compared to Mr. Poilievre (50 per cent), and that he ranks five percentage points higher than Mr. Poilievre when respondents were asked who they see as a ""strong leader."" An Ipsos poll asked Canadians who they think would ""roll over and accept"" Mr. Trump’s demands – 43 per cent said Mr. Poilievre would, compared to 22 per cent for Mr. Carney. That’s devastating for the Conservatives, especially if the question of who can best counter Mr. Trump continues to be the ballot question for the next five weeks. Plenty of things can and will change before April 28. Indeed, there are a handful more of their own past policies the Liberals have yet to come out and repudiate, and Conservative policies they can still adopt as their own. But the Trump factor isn’t going anywhere, and on that, Mr. Poilievre is decidedly weak. And if there’s one thing Liberal campaigners do exceptionally well, it’s exploiting an opposition leader’s weakness.

What this election has to be about: a strong and free Canada:   Canadians are waiting for Mark Carney or Pierre Poilievre to articulate a sweeping strategy for building a more resilient country. Neither is yet delivering,2025.0,"The two party leaders with a plausible shot at becoming Canada’s next prime minister did their best on Sunday to define the stakes in the election now set for April 28. With the cloud of U.S. President Donald Trump’s rhetoric hanging over the country, neither had anything particularly surprising or inspiring to say. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre framed the vote around the same message he has been delivering for two years: that Canada can’t afford to give the Liberals a fourth term. He listed off all the well-known negatives – the housing crisis, the affordability crisis, the immigration crisis – and tried to place them squarely on the shoulders of Liberal Leader Mark Carney. ""A Liberal is a Liberal,"" he said. Mr. Carney argued that there are Liberals, and then there are other Liberals. He said that, in the nine days that he served as prime minister, his government ended the much unloved Liberal carbon fuel tax and stopped an unpopular Liberal increase in the capital gains tax from coming into force. The former central banker and businessman also took a jab at Mr. Poilievre, a career politician. ""It’s easy to be negative about everything when you’ve never fixed anything,"" Mr. Carney said, without naming his opponent. ""It’s easy to be negative about everything when you’ve never built anything. When you’ve never had to make a payroll."" A disastrous Liberal record that had the Conservatives leading the Liberals by more than 20 points in the polls last fall, or a fresh Liberal leader with global business experience so buoyed by Mr. Trump’s outrageous attacks on Canada that the race is now a dead heat: those are the ballot questions as the two party leaders see them. But this election has to be about so much more than that. Canadians are ready for their leaders to be bold. They are united about what needs to be done: lowering taxes, rebuilding the military, forging new military alliances, making Canada more open to investment, exploiting its natural resources and, above all, reducing this country’s reliance on the U.S. for trade and defence. Where was the grander and inspiring vision of a new, independent, powerful Canada at a moment its citizens are ready to follow its leaders there?

This library that straddles the U.S. and Canada border was created as a symbol of our nations' friendship and co-operation for more than 100 years. The library is located close to my home and, for many years, provided both communities books in French and English, films, live operas, community theatre, concerts of all sorts and various public gatherings that were social, cultural and political in nature. Politicians will gather here and claim the need to defend this heritage of peaceful coexistence. I presume the glorious leader on the other side of the border will use this symbolic gesture to garner a better position in his renegotiations of the tri-country Free Trade Agreement CUSMA. After all, he made electoral promises to the middle-class workers of the faltering mid-west industrial complex. This may all sound so grim and maybe makes us helpless as we walk the food isles and choose Canadian over U.S. made products. But I propose that this is just a hiccup in U.S. politics. These are growing pains for a country in desperate need of a revamped constitution that could and should reflect its changing socio-cultural makeup. This act, intended to induce media hype, is clearly part of the hubris of an empire that has reached its peak and now suddenly realizes and fears the path down the steep and deathly slope to reality, maturity and ultimately melancholy.

Vic Tyrer, Oshawa Time to rethink mineral demand Poilievre wants 'shovel ready zones' with pre-approved construction permits, March 20 It's time to cool Ring of Fire rhetoric and bring some critical thinking to critical minerals. Where are Ontario's critical minerals? What do we need? How can we get at them in a timely way and in a manner that respects Indigenous decision-making, protects our environment and doesn't jeopardize our path to net zero by 2050? Timmins and Sudbury have bigger nickel deposits. The Crawford Nickel project just north of Timmins is more than 150 times the size of Eagle's Nest in the Ring of Fire and is located near existing infrastructure. The Crean Hill project in Sudbury is also bigger and located in a brownfield area. Some people might argue, what about the chromite? Well there's more than enough shipping grade chromite in the world to ""meet conceivable demand for centuries."" That's from a 2025 United States Geological Survey report. It's time to rethink mineral demand and build a circular economy. Let's examine options in brownfield sites (and in other places that have already been mined) and prioritize sites closer to existing infrastructure with community acceptance and avoid damaging peatlands with deep rich carbon stores that have been cooling the planet for thousands of years. Anna Baggio, conservation director, Wildlands League, Toronto Bike lane plan may bring more injury and death It's spring and people are excited to get outside and become more active again, particularly on their bicycles. This year, I predict there will be even more injuries and deaths than usual, especially if the province goes forward with removing bike lanes in Toronto. I've been biking for transportation in Toronto for 25 years. Back then it was mostly young guys on bikes and you had to be confident, skilled, and sometimes aggressive to get anywhere in this city on a bike because we didn't have bike lanes to protect us. In the past 10 years, we've seen an explosion in the number of people getting around on bikes in Toronto thanks to the proliferation of bike lanes and bikeshare. Most of the folks I see on bikes today wouldn't consider themselves ""cyclists."" They don't wear Lycra, they don't weave between cars or bunny hop over curbs and potholes. They're just trying to get around as cheaply and efficiently as possible. Some never would have felt comfortable biking in Toronto 25 years ago. If the province goes through with its plan to remove bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University, these newer cyclists will continue to ride their bikes, but they won't have that protection from drivers. I think we're going to see a significant increase in the number of collisions, resulting in life-altering injuries and disabilities, as well as deaths, if the province's plan goes forward. Their own studies said as much. I've asked the minister of health to intervene because the health-care costs are going to be enormous. We will see more people with chronic pain, disabilities and brain injuries as a direct result of removing bike lanes. Our health-care system can't handle what's coming.

"U.S. threats on front burner:   All leaders focused on Trump heading into April 28 election Carney, Poilievre trade jabs amid trade war uncertainty Green co-leader: 'Vote like your country depends on it'",2025.0,"Donald Trump's shadow fell across the start of the 45th federal election campaign Sunday, marked by bitter partisan jabs and an early $6-billion Liberal promise to slash income taxes as the major parties made competing cases for who represents the change Canada needs. The U.S. president was mentioned in every campaign speech as political leaders laid out how they would address American economic aggression and reject Trump's repeated desire to make Canada part of the United States. Those dangers featured prominently as party leaders hailed the chance to win votes over a five-week campaign that will conclude on April 28. The Trump factor also coloured how each political leader portrayed - or ignored - the other, with Liberal Leader Mark Carney describing the Conservatives' Pierre Poilievre as a ""Canadian Trump."" Poilievre, in turn, accused the Liberals of leaving Canada ""weak"" (yet avoided his usual description of the country as ""broken"") in the face of Trump's tariffs. And NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh alleged neither could be trusted to protect everyday people from the pain of the ongoing trade war. Fraying Canada-U. S. ties will form the emotional backdrop of the Liberals' pitch Monday as Carney heads to Gander, N.L., where 38 planes carrying hundreds of Americans landed after U.S. airspace was closed on 9/11, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Poilievre headed quickly to the crucial battleground of the GTA Sunday, while Singh plans to rally supporters in Toronto after a trip to Montreal. But on Day 1, after triggering the election on Sunday, it was Carney who came out with a surprise policy announcement, revealing details of the ""middle class"" income tax cut he teased during the recent Liberal leadership race. It was part of an effort to bill himself as an agent of action who has already put the federal government on a different course nine days after he replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister. Carney checked off an action list that included dropping the federal consumer carbon price, cancelling a planned tax increase on capital gains and a plan published Friday to slash red tape and accelerate construction of major projects like pipelines, high-speed rail and new electricity grids. Describing this as a ""tremendous amount of change,"" he argued he needs a ""strong, positive mandate"" to keep governing in the face of Trump's ""unjustified"" tariffs and annexation threats. ""President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen,"" Carney said. Carney also took aim at Poilievre, alluding to his career as a politician and alleging he has a negative political style that doesn't fit the needs of the moment. ""It's easy to be negative about everything when you've never fixed anything. It's easy to be negative about everything when you've never built anything, when you've never had to make a payroll,"" Carney said. He also framed the election as a choice between Poilievre, a ""Canadian Trump,"" and ""a government that unites our country"" and grows the economy for all Canadians. Across the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Que., with the spires of Parliament Hill as his distant backdrop, Poilievre was accompanied by his wife, Anaida, and their two children to launch his campaign with a blistering attack on the Liberals' record in government. Like Carney, he emphasized change, but argued it is the Conservatives who will really offer ""hope"" and ""put Canada first for a change."" Voters should question whether the Liberals deserve to stay in power after almost a decade in which crime, grocery prices and the cost of housing climbed, Poilievre argued. ""A Liberal is a Liberal is a Liberal,"" he said. ""It's the same old Liberal MPs, the same Liberal ministers, the same Liberal advisers, the same Liberal elites, the same broken Liberal promises of the last 10 years. We cannot afford another lost Liberal decade."" He blamed the Liberal government for pushing investment into the U.S. by failing to approve major resource development projects, and accused the Carney-led party of harbouring a ""radical, post-national, borderless and globalist ideology"" that left Canada vulnerable to Trump's threats of annexation and trade tariffs. ""I know a lot of people are worried, angry and anxious - and with good reason - as a result of the president's unacceptable threats against our country,"" Poilievre said. ""I will protect Canada and I will always put our country first."" Poilievre promised to lower taxes, including by scrapping the entire federal carbon pricing regime designed to significantly slash greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. He repeated long-standing promises to remove a planned cap on emissions from the oil and gas sector - which Carney would keep - and speed up approvals of pipelines and other resource projects to ""break our dependence"" on the U.S. Asked whether he respects Trump, Poilievre said he respects the ""office"" of the president and any prime minister must work in such a spirit with any U.S. leader. But, he said he rejects the way Trump has been treating Canada. ""I will insist the president recognize the independence and sovereignty of Canada. I will insist that he stop tariffing our nation,"" Poilievre said. Neither Carney nor Poilievre alluded to the New Democrats on Day 1. But Singh launched his campaign by firing salvos at both, and painting a picture of Canadians struggling with rising costs made worse by Trump's trade war. Targeting Carney's integrity without backing up his allegations, Singh suggested the Liberal leader will make decisions ""to advance his personal wealth,"" alluding to his employment with Brookfield Asset Management after he was governor of the Bank of Canada and later the Bank of England. He also criticized Carney for dropping a planned increase to capital gains tax, which the Trudeau government had said would rake in billions of dollars in revenue from the wealthiest Canadians. ""You deserve a prime minister you can trust to make decisions in your best interest,"" Singh said. ""That's not Mark Carney. He has spent his whole career serving the interests of billionaires, of shareholders and CEOs."" Singh took shots at Poilievre, too, alleging the Conservatives would cut government programs in pursuit of lowering taxes that Singh argued would benefit the rich. ""I won't let anyone in this election tell Canadians that the only way to beat Donald Trump is to become more like his version of the United States, where billionaires rule and everyday people pay,"" he said. Carney, however, said he would drop the tax rate for the lowest income bracket from 15 per cent to 14 per cent, a move Liberals say would save roughly 22 million Canadians up to $412 in taxes this year, and cost the federal treasury about $6 billion in foregone revenue. Senior economist David Macdonald of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said although the proposed tax cut sounds like it will help people in the lowest tax bracket, or the lowest earners, in practice ""basically no low-income households will see any benefit from this,"" because they already have an array of tax breaks and tax credits available, and end up not paying any taxes. Only those who claim taxable income of $55,867 or more will get the full benefit of a percentage point reduction - or $412 as the Liberals calculate it. It is middle-class and higher-income earners, Macdonald said, who will benefit most. ""If you've got billions to spend, and maybe they think they do ... you can deploy that in a much more targeted way to have a real impact on poverty rates, which is one of the things that would spike in a tariff war"" as prices rise for essentials like food and energy, Macdonald said. In Montreal, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet predicted Trump's threats will be at the centre of this election campaign, and argued Quebecers would be best protected in Ottawa by the separatist party. Meanwhile, also in Montreal, Green Party co-leaders Elizabeth May and Jonathan Pedneault said Canada is stuck in an unfair system that enriches people at the expense of the majority of Canadians. Pedneault, running for a seat in Montreal, said Canada has the resources to improve people's lives, and called for voters to elect, honest and visionary MPs. ""Vote like your country depends on it. Vote like your planet depends on it,"" May added. ""Vote like your future depends on it. Let's have the highest voter turnout in the history of Canada. Take that, Trump! We're a country, we vote. We're proud citizens, and we will stand together.""

Poilievre in need of a new strategy,2025.0,"Last week, Pierre Poilievre announced a plan for ""shovel-ready zones"" across the country to accelerate development projects. Apparently, in these zones, projects come pre-approved. Neat! Getting stuff done is hard in this country - too hard. What a shovel-ready zone is or how it'll work isn't clear, but from the Conservatives, it's still great to see. Because they're finally not talking about a carbon-tax election. And this is a recent change: just a few days ago, Poilievre held a rally where he stood behind a lectern with a big AXE THE TAX sign on the front. Even as the ground shifted dramatically under the Conservative leader - Justin Trudeau out, Mark Carney and Donald Trump in - he had insisted on running essentially the same campaign that he's been running since 2022. It's not working. After establishing and then holding on to a massive lead, the Tories have been dropping for a month. They're now tied with the Carney Liberals, at best. More than one poll shows the Liberals in the lead. Promising to axe the tax even harder doesn't seem to be a way forward. What might? So far, the Tories have been focusing on Carney himself. That's fine. Politics is a rough sport - ""elbows up,"" to borrow a suddenly popular phrase. Carney is untested. He's been shielded from the media as much as his party has been able to get away with, and based on some of his early interactions, you can see why. So by all means, go after him. Call him nicknames. Ask about any conflicts of interest he might have. Fair! But. Ahem. That's not working either. The attacks are underway. The CPC keeps dropping. Let's insert the mandatory ""campaigns matter"" observation here. Let's also grant that we live in remarkably unsettled times and it's not at all clear how Carney will handle a sustained race. There's no reason to count the Tories out yet. Anything can happen. They still have a great shot, especially if - and it's a big if - the younger voters who've been drifting toward the CPC over the past few years stay there and show up on election day. But it seems increasingly clear that they're going to have that shot only if they adjust their campaign, and in a big way. We've already seen some shifts. More talk about ""Canada First."" Proposals to make Canada stronger, including those shovel-ready zones. Some guarded pushback against U.S. President Donald Trump's talk of annexation. This shows that Poilievre and his top advisers get it. Sort of. They understand that this isn't a race against what remained of Justin Trudeau, on issues where Trudeau was weakest. And they're trying to adjust strategy accordingly. The problem is, they're doing so in timid, incremental steps. Sending out the leader this week to talk about axing the tax - the industrial carbon tax, you see, the industrial one - is a sign that there's still a degree of denial or bargaining or some other phase of grief going on at CPC HQ. The Liberals are benefitting from two things, and two things only: The first is Trudeau's departure, and beyond the odd ""Just like Justin"" quip, there isn't much the CPC can do about that; the second is that the Liberals are seen as being stronger on Trump. A series of polls have shown this. As long as that's the ballot-box question, the CPC is in deep trouble. They don't necessarily need to beat Carney on that question. But they can't be way behind. If the CPC can go hard on Trump - and it's not clear that they'd be willing to risk alienating some portion of their voters to do this - they might be able to at least eat into Carney's lead on the Trump issue. This ought to be easy for Poilievre. Just have him show as much contempt for Trump as he has the former PM and random journalists. But (and here's the rub) you can't do it only once. A statement won't do. A speech won't do. A few tweets won't do. It has to be constant. Every day. The carbon tax, cost of living, stopping crime and building homes - those are now secondary issues. The primary issue, the only one that seems to matter, is who can best stand up to Trump. It's not the election the Conservatives wanted, but it's the one they're getting. The sooner they figure this out, the better off they'll be. Matt Gurney is a Toronto-based journalist, broadcaster and freelance contributing columnist for the Star.

Poilievre runs as 'change' candidate:   Conservative leader aims to end decade of Liberal rule,2025.0,"""For a change."" That was how Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre launched the most pivotal moment of his 21-year political career: the first day of an election campaign that could end with his installation as prime minister or see him relegated to the list of Tory leaders who successively failed to overthrow years of Liberal rule. For Poilievre, the challenge of this campaign is about more than just ushering in a change of government. The ground on which he crafted all of his punchy, pre-election messaging has also shifted, given U.S. President Donald Trump's expansionist and protectionist threats and former prime minister Justin Trudeau's exit. ""A new Conservative government will restore Canada's promise - the promise that anyone from anywhere can do anything, that hard work gets you a great life, in a beautiful home, on a safe street, under a proud flag,"" Poilievre said at a news conference in Gatineau, Que., on Sunday. ""To preserve that flag and uphold its promise, we must work together, fight together and win together for our people, for our land, for our home, for Canada first, for a change."" Later in the day, when Poilievre attended a campaign launch event in Carleton, his Ottawa-area riding, supporters waved Canadian flags instead of party-branded signage to herald his arrival. That wasn't the case in North York Sunday evening, where more than 2,000 supporters - based on party estimates - bedecked in Conservative party ball caps and ""Pierre for PM"" T-shirts snaked around Toronto's Pan Pacific hotel and packed the lobby, before cramming into an overheated ballroom and an overflow room to bask in Poilievre's glow. The leader was introduced by his wife, Anaida Poilievre, who talked about the struggles she faced when her family moved to Canada from Venezuela, and her husband's roots in Calgary, where he was adopted by two schoolteachers. Poilievre then took to the stage, which was surrounded by his party's candidates in the GTA, a seat-rich region held primarily by the Liberals that the Conservatives consider critical to their path to victory. ""For three terms, (the Liberals) provided weak and out-of-touch leadership. Three terms, they drove up costs and crime. Three terms, they sent our drugs south and pushed our economy under the American thumb,"" the Conservative leader said. ""My little boy understands something the Liberals do not. Which is in baseball, and in politics, it's three strikes and you're out."" At his news conference earlier in the day, Poilievre said the U.S. president had been ""very blunt that he wants a weak Canada that he can target, and Liberals, after the lost Liberal decade, have made our economy and our country weaker and more divided, just like Trump wanted."" Because of that, Poilievre said handing the Liberals a fourth term would erode Canada further. The Conservative leader said the Liberals had simply ""swapped"" Trudeau for the party's new leader, former central banker Mark Carney, and shared a list of commitments he would see through if elected prime minister: ""Axe taxes, reward work, unleash entrepreneurs, harvest our resources, make things here, build homes for our youth, secure our borders, rebuild our military, honour our history and raise our flag."" He also touted his ""bring it home tax cut on work, investment, energy and homebuilding"" to ensure Canadians ""bring home more of their paycheques,"" something he said starts with dismantling the entire federal carbon pricing system. Carney recently put an end to the consumer price on carbon - a chief policy irritant for Poilievre - but not the industrial price on heavy emitters. Poilievre has pledged to ditch the whole regime, and would instead expand existing tax credits for clean technology and investments in clean manufacturing. Adi, a Brampton resident who attended Poilievre's Toronto rally Sunday night and preferred not to provide his last name, told the Star that Poilievre needs to abandon issues like the consumer carbon price and the capital gains tax hike because Carney has already dealt with cancelling those policies. ""Focus on other stuff like immigration, focusing on crime, continue focusing on actual things you could do with the economy, with oil, with unleashing the potential in our economy,"" the 28-year-old said, wrapped in a Canadian flag. ""Talk more about the tariffs. Distance yourself from the Liberals when it comes to how you're gonna deal with Trump."" The Conservative leader plans to remain in the GTA for the next two days of the campaign.

Poilievre and Carney agree on one thing: This federal election is about change:   Conservative and Liberal ambitions are no longer separated on the polling graphs but are pretty much braided together. It’s up to voters to pull the thread,2025.0,"They say that in politics, timing is everything. On Sunday, as the long-awaited federal election campaign finally kicked off, there was a funhouse-mirror quality to the way everyone played with the notion of time. Liberal Leader Mark Carney made the ritualistic visit to Rideau Hall to ask the Governor-General to kill off this Parliament and send Canadians to the polls, and then he stepped to a lectern just outside the front doors to speak to the media. There, he offered a gauzy, nostalgic nod to the launch of his leadership campaign in an Edmonton hockey arena – exactly two months ago. He also highlighted the work of his government, including kiboshing the consumer price on carbon, measures to help workers hurt by U.S. tariffs and, newly pitched on Sunday, a tax cut aimed at middle- and low-income Canadians. This is, of course, the standard stuff of incumbent-government campaigns: Here are all the nice things we did, perhaps you’d like some more? Less standard is the lifespan of the specific government getting the retrospective treatment here: Nine whole days since Mr. Carney was last at Rideau Hall to be sworn in as Prime Minister with his new, svelte cabinet. ""What’s important is that the government has a mandate from the Canadian people to finish the job,"" he said on Sunday. ""To finish the job of building that Canadian economy, to finish the job of diversifying our trading partners, and to have a strong mandate to stand up to Donald Trump and the Americans and negotiate the best deal for Canadians."" A few kilometres away, on a terrace at the Canadian Museum of History, perched above the Ottawa River, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre started his own launch speech slightly before Mr. Carney’s, accompanied by his wife, Anaida, and their two small children. He offered a few remarks of empathy for how ""worried, angry and anxious"" Canadians were feeling about Mr. Trump’s threats to tariff Canada into the ground. And then he went back to the same argument he’s been making since he became Conservative Leader: that the Liberals have broken everything within reach, and that everything that’s wrong is their doing. It was as though Mr. Poilievre had retreated to his own time warp, one in which no one big and loud and papaya-hued had done anything major in the past few months. ""We cannot afford another lost Liberal decade,"" the Conservative Leader said. ""We need to put Canada first for a change with a new Conservative government to axe taxes, reward work, unleash entrepreneurs, harvest our resources, make things here, build homes for our youth, secure our borders, rebuild our military, honour our history and raise our flag."" Maybe it was the weather that was making people’s mental clocks weird. Ottawa is currently in the devious embrace of false spring, when the sunshine and colour of the air whisper of flowers and green shoots, but the wind will shear the exposed skin right off your bones. Once they’d both laid out their campaign cases, in fairly desultory fashion, it was clear that the Liberal and Conservative leaders agree heartily that this is an election about Canadians seeking change – they just disagree deeply on which one of them gets to wear that sash. Mr. Poilievre positions himself as a corrective, in both substance and tone, to everything people feel went off the rails during this past decade of Liberal rule. Mr. Carney, meanwhile, is attempting the trickier jujitsu move of being something new and distinct. This, despite wearing the same partisan sweater as a government so wildly unpopular a few months ago that the Ottawa bubble spent time in the fall contemplating whether it could even survive as a political party. But that was then and this is now. The red and blue lines on the polling graph are no longer separated by 20 points but instead pretty much braided together – life comes at you fast. For weeks, the widely rumoured election date was either May 5 or April 28. In the end, Mr. Carney opted for the shortest campaign permitted by Elections Canada – 36 days from the launch on Sunday – and so Canadians will vote at the end of April. Asked why he was sending people to the polls now, with Mr. Trump ready to lurch into attack mode at any moment, the Liberal Leader talked about the need to seek immediate marching orders from voters in order to deal with the existential threat. As always in politics, there’s the outside-voice noble reason to do something and then there’s the real reason. The polls are smiling on the Liberals at the moment, so it’s no wonder that Mr. Carney, with the incumbent’s power to decide when to pull the chute, is trying to trap this moment in amber. But here’s what’s great about wild political swings, beyond the crass entertainment value: They’re not caused by wind patterns or random-event generators. They’re fed by people who are paying attention. Canadians might be scared or enraged or incredulous or exhausted by the aggression from the south that caused all of this. They’re probably all of those things, in fact – but they’re also clearly listening and watching closely. What voters think and want is what’s caused this frantic blur of change across the political landscape for the past few months, and they will almost certainly set more of that into motion over the next 36 days. And then the decision is theirs.

Poilievre highlights trade war with U.S. in campaign kickoff,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre sought the leadership of the Conservative Party nearly three years ago saying he was running to be prime minister – and on Sunday, he began that bid in earnest with the start of the general election campaign. He began the first day with a Parliament Hill backdrop, the place he’s called his professional home for more than 20 years. But he ended it with a rally in the vote-rich Greater Toronto Area, where support for his party is crucial should he wish to move from the opposition benches and back into government. The Conservative Party rally at the Pan Pacific Hotel in northeast Toronto started late because of the size of the crowd, which crammed the hotel’s main ballroom. Organizers estimated that more than 2,400 people attended the event. Mr. Poilievre arrived on stage with his threeyear-old son Cruz in his arm and pointed out that his child was wearing a baseball jacket. The Conservative Leader then hit on his main message of the night, saying the Liberal government’s record shouldn’t be rewarded with a fourth term. “My little boy understands something those Liberals do not: In baseball and in politics, it’s three strikes and you’re out.” The fight Mr. Poilievre has on his hands in this campaign is markedly different than his leadership bid, where he batted away all opponents with ease. For a time last year, it appeared that the general election would be a cakewalk too – he drove his party to dominance in public-opinion polls thanks to Canadians’ frustration and fatigue with the Justin Trudeau Liberals and Mr. Poilievre’s promise to restore order to a country he kept telling people was broken. But then Mr. Trudeau quit and Mark Carney became Liberal Leader. In his maiden campaign remarks Sunday, Mr. Poilievre took aim at Mr. Carney and acknowledged that there’s another foe: U.S. President Donald Trump, whose threats to use economic force to annex Canada have created an unprecedented amount of uncertainty for the country as a whole, and for Canadians personally. “I share your anger and I share the worry for our future, but I also draw great resolve in knowing that we can transform the anxiety and anger into action,” he said, standing on the rooftop of a building next to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, his family watching from a nearby bench. Polls suggest the anxiety among Canadians is being channelled into support for the Liberals, something that Alberta Premier Danielle Smith – an ally of Mr. Poilievre’s – told an American conservative news outlet she expressed to the Trump administration. But, she said to Breitbart, if the administration is willing to wait, it may find that a Poilievre government would be more in sync with its aspirations – comments that sent Conservatives cringing and hurrying to point to the times in recent days that Mr. Trump has disparaged the Conservative Leader and said he’d prefer a Liberal running Canada. That Canadians see negative parallels between Mr. Trump and Mr. Poilievre – both pledge to end “woke” culture, both promise major cuts to foreign aid and to the public service – was put to Mr. Poilievre on Sunday. He was asked what he would say to them. In French, he answered, “I’m Canadian.” In English, Mr. Poilievre said that when he promises to cut taxes, increase naturalresource production and create jobs, it is “bad news” for the President, because it means Canada will become more self-reliant and sovereign. But Conservatives fear that the linkage will endure throughout the campaign. An early attack ad from the Liberals featured Mr. Poilievre’s comments and approach to the media juxtaposed against Mr. Trump’s own. The Conservatives will seek to neutralize those attacks with the argument that Mr. Trump is preying on a weak economy created by the Liberals. In the weeks before the start of this campaign, the Conservatives had blanketed the airwaves with ads in English, French and other languages in an early attack on Mr. Carney. Now, the groundwork begins in earnest. After spending the first few days in the Greater Toronto Area, Mr. Poilievre is expected to tour Quebec and then head west, with British Columbia being a similarly important battleground. His focus isn’t just in keeping the Liberals out of power, but also driving NDP voters to his side, especially in rural regions and the B.C. Interior. But a sign of how quickly the ground appears to be is shifting for the Conservatives could be found locally in Ottawa Sunday. Mr. Poilievre went to his home riding of Carleton to open his campaign office, and paid tribute to local candidates from the Ottawa area. In particular, he singled out Barbara Bal – who has spent well over a year campaigning for the party in the Ottawa riding of Nepean. The party thought the riding could be a simple pickup from the Liberals, especially after the MP, Chandra Arya, was kicked out of the Liberal leadership race and then told he couldn’t run for the party this campaign. Late Saturday, Ms. Bal discovered who her new opponent was: new Liberal Leader Mark Carney.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Levitz, Stephanie; Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 24, 2025",Conservatism; Political campaigns; Canadians; Negative campaigning; Political leadership; Political parties,,2025-03-24,The Globe and Mail
Alberta Premier asked the U.S. to pause tariffs to help Poilievre win,2025.0,"Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says she asked the Trump administration to pause its tariff actions until after the Canadian federal election in hopes of seeing a win by Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives. The Premier made her comments in an interview with Breitbart News Saturday on March 8. They resurfaced on the weekend, with the official kickoff of the campaign on Sunday. “Because of what we see as unjust and unfair tariffs, it’s actually caused an increase in support for the Liberals,” Ms. Smith told Breitbart News Washington bureau chief Matthew Boyle. “So that’s what I fear. The longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture, and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now. I would hope that we could put things on pause, is what I’ve told administration officials.” Ms. Smith did not specify to whom in the administration she made her remarks, or what response she received. Her comments drew criticism that she was issuing an invitation to meddle in the electoral process. Naheed Nenshi, Leader of Alberta’s New Democrats, accused Ms. Smith of being happier to placate U.S. President Donald Trump than to work with Canadians. “Calling for a pause on tariffs to politically benefit one party or another isn’t the right approach,” Mr. Nenshi said in a statement. “But standing firm for Canada is.” Sam Blackett, press secretary to Ms. Smith, said any suggestion that the Premier is asking the U.S. to interfere in Canada’s election is “offensive and false.” Ms. Smith said in a statement that she has been working to convince U.S. officials at all levels of just how damaging the threatened tariffs would be to both Canadians and Americans. This has included asking those same officials to refrain from placing tariffs on Canadian goods until a proper renegotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement can be held after the election, with a Prime Minister who has won a mandate from Canadians, she said. “Now that an election has been called, I would reiterate my hope that the U.S. would refrain from placing tariffs on their closest ally and largest trading partner during the middle of the election,” she said. Mr. Poilievre did not directly answer a question from The Globe and Mail about the appropriateness of Ms. Smith’s comments. Instead, he said there is good reason why Mr. Trump said it would be easier to deal with Canada if the Liberals formed the next government: because Liberals have weakened the country. Liberal Leader Mark Carney said it will be up to voters to decide whether they want a unified government standing up for Canada or one that wants “division and Americanism,” which he said is what Mr. Poilievre seems to be offering, and Ms. Smith is endorsing. In another part of the interview, the Premier suggested that Mr. Poilievre’s policies would most closely align with Mr. Trump’s. “Pierre believes in development. He believes in low-cost energy. He believes that we need to have low taxes, doesn’t believe in any of the woke stuff that we’ve seen taking over our politics for the last five years,” Ms. Smith said. “There’s probably still always going to be areas that are skirmishes or disputes about particular industries when it comes to the border, but I would say, on balance, the perspective that Pierre would bring would be very much in sync with, I think, the new direction in America. I think we’d have a really great relationship for the period of time they’re both in.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Woo, Andrea",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 24, 2025",Political campaigns; Tariffs,Nom: Breitbart News Network; NAICS: 516210,2025-03-24,The Globe and Mail
Pierre Poilievre launches his campaign by returning to his 'underdog' political roots,2025.0,"OTTAWA - As Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre sets off on the biggest fight of his political career, he began by reminiscing about his first. Standing on a platform surrounded by volunteers and candidates in his Ottawa-area riding of Carleton on Sunday, Poilievre recalled the former location of his first campaign office when he was successfully elected as a member of Parliament back in 2004. ""Remember they said we had no chance?"" the 45-year-old said. ""We were the underdogs, but we got into it then for the very same reason we're in it now. We're here to bring home Canada's promise."" With public opinion polls showing Conservatives locked in a dead heat with the incumbent Liberals after the departure of Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war collapsing the party's nearly 20-point lead, Conservative supporters are counting on Poilievre to apply the same energy, ambition and skill over the next 36-day campaign as he did when he was a fresh-faced twenty-something in his first race. Bill Donaldson, his campaign manager from that 2004 contest, recalls he had a knack for getting people excited even then. Before taking the role, Donaldson had only met Poilievre briefly, first at a convention for the Reform Party, which later merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the current Conservative party, and later when Poilievre turned up on his doorstep as he was campaigning for the party's nomination. ""We had six people vying for the leadership, and one of them was this gangly youth called Pierre Poilievre,"" he told National Post in an interview ""People didn't know how to pronounce his name,"" Donaldson said. ""He was new, and he didn't look 23, he looked 20, maybe 19."" What Donaldson remembers most about his nomination win was that he was the only candidate to bring supporters to their feet. ""I wouldn't call him anywhere at the time a polished speech maker, or speaker, but he managed to enthuse about half that hall into standing up and clapping."" Poilievre enters Canada's 45th election pitching himself as the leader representing change after nearly a decade of Liberal rule, calling the preceding years the ""lost decade."" While newly elected Liberal Leader Mark Carney is his main opponent, Poilievre is being forced to navigate a campaign where Trump's tariffs threat and the president's comments around wanting Canada to become a state loom large. It comes after having spent the past two years championing cost-of-living issues and preparing to fight what he called a ""carbon tax election."" Following a deliberate message shift, Poilievre is now trying to thread the needle between voters' fears about threats from the U.S., while tying it back to the economic situation Canada finds itself. Before his stop in Ottawa on the day the election kicked off Sunday, Poilievre appeared at the Museum of History across the river from Parliament Hill, where he said he shares the anger and anxiety Canadians feel under Trump. ""I respect the office of the President of the United States and we have to show respect to other world leaders,"" Poilievre said, when asked whether he respects him. Given the two countries' trading relationship and the fact Trump will be in office for the next four years, he said Canada's next prime minister will have to work with him. ""You can be respectful and firm, and I believe we have to be both. I will insist the president recognize the independence and sovereignty of Canada. I will insist that he stop tariffing our nation."" ""At the same time,"" Poilievre says, ""I will strengthen our country so that we can be capable of standing (on) our own two feet and standing up to the Americans, where and when necessary. That's what it means when I say let's put Canada first for a change."" Carney wasted no time on Sunday arguing Poilievre was stealing his policy ideas from Trump's administration, as he stood in front of Rideau Hall, having just asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament, triggering an election set for April 28. The Liberals have spent years trying to plant the seed with voters of Poilievre being Trump-like, taking particular aim at his aggressive political style, both in Parliament and when dealing with media. Appearing at his campaign launches on Sunday, Poilievre was all smiles, waving for the cameras, accompanied by his wife, Ana, and their two children, Valentina and Cruz. Poilievre also made a point during his speeches to introduce himself to Canadians by speaking about his upbringing, recounting how he was raised by two schoolteachers after being put up for adoption by a 16-year-old single mother. Those ""humble beginnings"" gave him a sense of why Canada is special, Poilievre said at his event in Gatineau. As far as political beginnings go, Gatineau is where Poilievre lived when he arrived on Parliament Hill two decades ago to work as a staffer before taking a shot at elected politics, coming to Ottawa from Calgary where he got his first taste in politics as a teenager. Donaldson recalls Poilievre's stamina as a rookie candidate when it came to door knocking. ""He had a really good way with people."" Not only would he stay out until 11:30 p.m., hollering at people in an apartment block on their balconies, there was one day he turned up on doorsteps sopping wet from the rain - a state that earned the young candidate an invite inside to warm up with tea. ""He was athletic and long-legged, and he could jump over driveways without touching a blade of grass. It was like an antelope. I got tired just watching him stand still sometimes,"" Donaldson said. In terms of lessons from that first campaign, Donaldson said Poilievre learned the importance of appreciating volunteers. The first group he ever had would go on to throw him a birthday party, he said. During that race itself, Donaldson said he advised Poilievre against his instincts of wanting to attack his opponent at the time, former Liberal cabinet minister David Pratt, who was well-liked in the riding. Poilievre appears to be heeding similar advice for his current campaign, given his sparse mention of Carney on Sunday and in recent public announcements. Since Poilievre became party leader in 2022, Donaldson said he has attended three of his rallies and the pair still greet each other warmly. When he watches him now, he sees in him about ""90 per cent"" of the candidate from that first race. ""Definitely more mature, a little more laid back. Careful.""

"Terry Newman: Carney tries, and fails, to turn himself into Poilievre at election launch",2025.0,"On Sunday, freshly minted Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Governor General Mary Simon at Rideau Hall triggering a federal election which will send Canadians to the ballot boxes on April 28. Parliament is now dissolved. Monday's previously scheduled return to the House of Commons for MPs is now cancelled. Carney, who appeared shaky at his pulpit on the steps of Rideau Hall, has a temporary respite from a skills test in the House against Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Instead, Carney's been catapulted into the ultimate test, a federal election shadowed by unresolved questions about his financial assets, possible conflicts of interest, copy-pasting of Conservative policy promises, and the fact he's yet to attempt negotiations with Trump. If the polls are to be believed, the Liberals have performed a magic trick. They've managed to maintain virtually the same party, taking it from the very dismal 16 per cent popularity to overtaking the Conservatives in the latest Ipsos poll by 42-36, all by replacing their leader. Nanos Research pollster Nik Nanos has suggested this fight between the Liberals and Conservatives will be akin to ""a knife fight in a telephone booth."" There was some speculation that this telephone booth might be located in Edmonton Centre, a riding that if Carney chose to run in, could have signalled affinity for Alberta. Much ado was made of Carney, who is from Edmonton, making a hometown comeback. He participated in an on-ice activity with the Oilers before a game on Thursday. On the social media platform X, Carney shared a polished campaign video of himself in an Oilers jersey with the number 24, nodding to the fact that he's the 24th prime minister, skating on the ice and hanging out in the team's dressing room. Terry Newman: Mark Carney's climate obsessions will put Trudeau to shame Terry Newman: How fast will Carney flee if he loses election? Comedian Mike Myers, who left Canada for the U.S. 36 years ago, also showed up at the rink to support Carney, and to apparently dispel any concerns that living in the U.S. (or elsewhere) makes one less Canadian. Carney's recent lack of habitation in Canada is really no big deal, you see. What's really important is not that Carney has spent so much time living outside of Canada, but that he knows the names of Mr. Dressup's two puppets, Casey and Finnegan. That's quite a low bar for prime ministerial suitability. Internal polling must have suggested this wasn't Carney's best shot, because we now know he'll be running in Nepean, ON., where there he will face off with Conservative MP candidate Barbara Bal, a staff sergeant who's been in law enforcement for over 27 years and has received a police exemplary service medal. Of course, the bigger fight is with Poilievre, whose policies Carney has, for the most part, copied and pasted. And Sunday's announcement of the election was no exception. Poilievre has promised to cut income taxes, and on Sunday, Carney pledged to reduce income tax in the lowest bracket by one per cent up to $57,375, leading to a savings of about $825 per year for a two-income family. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks at a news conference to launch his campaign for the federal election, in Gatineau, Que., on Sunday, March 23, 2025. Poilievre promised to axe the consumer carbon tax. Up until recently, the Liberals attacked him endlessly for this. Carney has since reduced it to zero. It is not actually cancelled, despite claims by the Liberal party. That would require legislation, so the tax is still officially on the books. Poilievre promised to scrap both the consumer and the industrial carbon tax, preferring to use tax credits to reward companies that lower emissions. In other words, unlike Carney, he's chosen to use positive rather than negative incentives. Poilievre promised to speed up approvals for energy projects. Mark Carney recently promised the same, saying he'd create a ""one-window"" approval process, but failed to explain what he'd do about the Liberals' existing regulatory regime that has spooked investors up until now, leading to projects being cancelled Carney's been caught speaking out of both sides of his mouth, depending on the language being used and where he's located. Carney wrote in his 2021 book Value(s) that 80 per cent of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground to meet 2050 net-zero targets, saying even Greta Thunberg could do the math. Does this seem like someone who will be interested in pipelines? Poilievre said he'd reverse the Liberal's proposed capital gains tax hike from 50 to 66.7 per cent. Mark Carney has cancelled the capital gains tax increase Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Poilievre promised to cap immigration and tie it to housing construction rates. Carney promised a temporary cap on immigration until numbers return to pre-pandemic levels The only problem with that is there was already a housing crisis at that time. Carney commented Sunday that the crisis was a post-pandemic issue. This kind of knowledge requires being steeped in Canada, not simply recalling the names of Mr. Dressup's puppets. Carney began his election announcement by telling the assembled crowd he knew our country needed to act to fix our economy, to fight the Americans and to deal with Donald Trump's tariffs. He told Canadians he will end all provincial trade barriers by July 1st to create one Canadian economy, a welcome change that shouldn't have required the threats of Donald Trump to happen. He said, ""This past week, we acted to protect workers, using the proceeds of our retaliatory tariffs against America's unjustified trade actions. We acted to unlock major infrastructure projects and get them moving rapidly including clean and conventional energy, critical minerals, and new trade corridors with reliable trading partners. We acted to create new supports for farmers and businesses during this trade war. We expanded dental care for millions of more Canadians."" ""We acted,"" is being used very liberally here, as Carney has been prime minister for all of nine days. Where and what are these major projects that are now ""unlocked""? He continued. ""We can't control the U.S. president, but we can control our destiny,"" he said. ""And the best way we can deal with this crisis is to build our strength here at home and to help people who will be hit hardest by these tariffs. That's the right thing to do. That's the fair thing to do. That's the Canadian thing to do,"" he said. The question remains as to whether retaliatory tariffs and this workers' program are the necessary thing to do. As one reporter pointed out, Carney hasn't even bothered to engage in negotiations with Trump yet. Carney's financials, potential conflicts of interest and his climate obsessions hung like a shadow over his head as he announced the, shortest possible, 36-day election. Reporters below the steps who had waited over an hour and a half for him to give his speech appeared to have sensed these insecurities and went for his jugular, one asking why he'd throw Canada into an election during a trade war before giving Canadians a chance to test drive him, his answer wasn't convincing, and can be summed up as, ""We've been busy, and we've changed.""

Poilievre launches his campaign promising to be 'respectful and firm' against Trump,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre launched his campaign Sunday promising to deliver change, and contrasting himself to the man his Liberal opponents are expected to try and paint him as over the next 36 days: U.S. President Donald Trump. Appearing at the Museum of History across the river from Parliament Hill, Poilievre said he shares the anger and anxiety Canadians are feeling because of Trump's words and the current trade war Canada finds itself in with its closest ally. ""I respect the office of the President of the United States and we have to show respect to other world leaders,"" Poilievre said, when asked whether he respects Trump. He said given the two countries' trading relationship and that Trump will be in office for the next four years, Canada's next prime minster will have to work with him. ""You can be respectful and firm, and I believe we have to be both. I will insist the president recognize the independence and sovereignty of Canada. I will insist that he stop tariffing our nation."" ""At the same time,"" Poilievre said, ""I will strengthen our country so that we can be capable of standing (on) our own two feet and standing up to the Americans, where and when necessary. That's what it means when I say let's put Canada first for a change."" Liberal Leader Mark Carney wasted no time arguing that Poilievre was stealing his policy ideas from Trump's administration. ""That's the choice for Canadians: a Canadian Trump or a government that unites the country and focuses on action in order to build a strong economy that works for all Canadians,"" said Carney, in French, at a press conference outside Rideau Hall on Sunday. Poilievre launched his campaign as public opinion polls show his two-and-a-half-year 20-point lead over the Liberals collapsing into a dead heat between the two parties, with concerns about the cost-of-living taking a back seat to Trump's tariffs and his comments about annexing Canada. The Conservative leader, who has spent the preceding months championing affordability issues, is now trying to thread the needle between voters' fears about threats coming from the U.S., and the economic situation Canada finds itself in. Asked about Alberta Premier Danielle's Smith comments made to the far-right outlet Breitbart, where she said Trump's trade war was helping the Liberals politically and that her message to administration officials was that Poilievre would be more aligned with its direction, Poilievre sidestepped her comments, instead referring an interview Trump gave where the president said it would be easier to work with a Liberal in power. Trump is nonetheless expected to loom large over the campaign and, next week, the president's deadline for new tariffs on Canada will arrive. Poilievre spoke on Sunday about half an hour before Carney was scheduled to ask Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament and send Canadians to the polls next month. ""I will protect this country and put Canada first,"" said Poilievre, in a speech that excoriated the Liberal government's record of a ""lost decade."" LIVE: Canada First - For a Change - Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) March 23, 2025 Poilievre also used the speech to introduce himself to Canadians, explaining that he ""was born to a 16 year old single mother who put me up for adoption to two school teachers."" Those ""humble beginnings"" gave him a sense of why Canada is special, said Poilievre. He appeared alongside his wife, Ana, along with their two children, Valentina and Cruz. He smiled and waved with his family, afterwards introducing his son to reporters and well as his stuffed toy penguin, whom Poilievre confirmed was named penguin.

Raymond J. de Souza: Poilievre must pivot from his apple munching ways,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre often stresses that the Liberals are seeking a fourth consecutive term, implying that four is simply too many. It certainly is for Conservatives, who have never won four in a row since Sir John A. Macdonald, who won four consecutive majorities (and six of the first seven Canadian federal elections). For the Liberals, contrariwise, four is, as in golf, par for the course. Sir Wilfrid Laurier won four consecutive majorities himself. His successor as Liberal leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King, won three consecutive minorities in the 1920s, and then three more elections in 1935, 1940 and 1945. Together with his successor, Louis St. Laurent (majorities in 1949 and 1953), they won five straight. After the John Diefenbaker interlude, Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau won another five straight elections (and six out of seven) from 1963 to 1980. Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin then won another four straight elections from 1993 to 2004. If Prime Minister Mark Carney were to win a fourth after Justin Trudeau's three, it would fit a 125-year pattern. A fourth Liberal mandate would be wholly unremarkable in Canadian history. What is remarkable is that the day before yesterday Poilievre was cruising along, confident - perhaps even complacent - of a thumping majority. Then cometh Trump and goeth Trudeau, presenting the possibility that cometh Carney may mean goeth Poilievre. After leading by wide polling margins for two years, Poilievre still has the advantage. The voters' settled judgment in his favour is being reconsidered now, but reconsideration is not followed inevitably by reversal. Reconsideration may lead to reconfirmation. That happened in 1984 and 1993. Aside from his Ottawa relaunch rally - at which Poilievre not only wrapped himself in the flag but even put on a suit - the opposition leader has not been campaigning vigorously; all the attention has been on President Donald Trump, Premier Doug Ford and now Carney. Perhaps Poilievre is preparing to follow the pattern of Stephen Harper's first victorious campaign, when he unveiled a new policy each day for thirty days straight. There is much yet for Canadians to see and judge. Yet one thing will have to change. Poilievre will have to leave behind the politics of humiliation. It is a key part of Trump's appeal; he delights in humiliating others. His tribe delights in watching him do so. And it is a source of his power. He humiliates his allies. If they refuse to accept it, Trump turns on them. But if they compound their humiliation with self-abasement, Trump rewards them. Canada is now the target of Trumpian humiliation. Canadians have not chosen self-abasement. Carney demonstrates in his (historically) astonishing decision to have no direct contact with the American president in the first weeks of his premiership. He says that he will speak with Trump when the ""disrespect"" stops. He does not offer pre-emptive obeisance. For the moment Carney's distance from Trump, who is massively unpopular with Canadian voters, poses something of a challenge for Poilievre. There is no indication that Poilievre would abase himself before Trump, and Carney was wrong to claim as much in his victory speech. Nevertheless, as Canadians reject the politics of humiliation, Poilievre has a problem. He has practised it. Despite more than two years as Conservative leader, making his agenda clear, including some significant policy proposals, a critical first, and lasting, impression for many was his apple-chomping interview in British Columbia. He was not going into battle with the titans of Canadian journalism; he was talking to the local, leftist editor of a community newspaper printed in Osoyoos. He humiliated him; the apple-chomping emphasized that he was not even worth interrupting a snack. It was rude and a bit cruel. It was also massively popular. Many people like that sort of thing. There are many foreigners who know nothing else about Poilievre - and love him for it. It was not a one-off. While Poilievre is endlessly gracious with those who come to his rallies, his dealings with the media are often dismissive, offering a snarl instead of a smile. The politics of humiliation can be darkly fascinating, even appealing in a mildly sinister way - when it is others who are being humiliated. In the 1990s a rather innocent program was launched, a sort of precursor to reality TV, America's Funniest Home Videos. It ran for some 35 years in total. Viewers would send in videos of people falling off ladders, dropping a birthday cake, forgetting to set the parking brake, that kind of thing. Good for a laugh on video. But in real life, we don't laugh when someone falls off a ladder. It's even less funny if you are the one falling. The MAGA element finds it amusing to see their dear leader insult Canada. Canadians don't. Therein lies a difficulty for Poilievre. A vocal minority of his supporters rather like the politics of humiliation, even as Canadians have, in this moment of maximum Trump, emphatically soured on that approach. Carney, smiling with the King, skating with the Oilers, has deliberately offered the contrast of an understated pride, a comforting presence. More smiles than snarls. His minor missteps have come when he been snarky with reporters. The politics of humiliation is driven by the desire to tear others down, to destroy. Not for nothing, then, was Carney's leadership campaign slogan ""a time to build."" Whether it is enough to construct a fourth electoral victory we shall soon see.

"Mark Carney defends launching early election campaign, with more U.S. tariffs expected:   The Liberal Leader framed both Trump and his main opponent, Pierre Poilievre, as threats to Canada",2025.0,"Liberal Leader Mark Carney defended launching an election campaign in the midst of an escalating trade war with the United States, in which more punitive U.S. tariffs are expected within 10 days, by saying he wants Canadian voters to sign off on his plans to fireproof the Canadian economy against the threat posed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Speaking at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, shortly after asking Governor-General Mary Simon to dissolve Parliament, Mr. Carney told reporters he needs a strong mandate for dealing with Mr. Trump and for changes he’s proposing. These include a one percentage point income tax cut to the lowest tax bracket and efforts to diversify the economy away from the United States. Mr. Trump has already imposed several punitive tariffs on Canadian imports, including 25-per-cent levies on steel and aluminum, and has promised more are coming April 2 – a further economic hit that Mr. Carney as prime minister will be forced to address in the midst of this five-week election campaign. The Liberals and Conservatives are roughly tied in the polls at the outset of this campaign – a reversal of fortune for the governing party since then-leader Justin Trudeau announced his resignation and as Mr. Trump has stepped up attacks on Canada, repeatedly talking of his desire to make this country the ""51st state."" On Sunday, Mr. Carney framed both Mr. Trump and his main opponent, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, as threats to Canada. ""President Trump claims that Canada isn’t a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us,"" he said at the outset of the campaign. ""We will not let that happen."" The Liberal Leader told reporters that Mr. Poilievre offers ""division and Americanism"" like Mr. Trump’s administration. He noted the Conservative Leader has vowed to cut foreign aid, just like the White House has in the United States with significant reductions to the U.S. Agency for International Development. In February, Mr. Poilievre promised he would fund a military base in Iqaluit and ""dramatically cut"" foreign aid to pay for it. The promised income-tax cut announced Sunday by Mr. Carney would reduce the marginal tax rate on the lowest tax bracket by one percentage point. His campaign said it would cost roughly $6-billion a year on forgone tax revenue. Mr. Carney said it would save a two-income family up to $825 a year. The Liberal Leader, who succeeded Justin Trudeau as prime minister after winning his party’s leadership race, has made a slew of announcements since taking office – several of which copy proposals first made by Mr. Poilievre. At a campaign rally in St. John’s Sunday night, Mr. Carney once again derided his opponent as a Trump copycat and said Mr. Poilievre ""would kneel down before"" the U.S. President. ""Our new government has done more than Pierre Poilievre could imagine in his lifetime of politics – if he had some imagination and didn’t just mimic Donald Trump."" ""His division isn’t strength,"" the Liberal leader said of his Conservative opponent. ""Because we know negativity isn’t going to win a trade war. Negativity won’t pay the rent or the mortgage. Negativity won’t bring down the price of groceries."" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has taken criticism for an interview she conducted with U.S. news outlet Breitbart News in which she revealed she had asked the United States administration to pause its tariffs during Canada’s federal election campaign because this trade action was benefiting the country’s governing Liberals in the polls and hurting Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives. ""I take note of her alignment of Mr. Poilievre with Mr. Trump,"" Mr. Carney said of the Alberta Premier. ""And would note that that’s one of the decisions that Canadians will have to make, whether they want a government that is unifying, standing up for Canada and is taking focused action to build a better economy,"" or whether they want Mr. Poilievre. The White House calls the coming levies ""reciprocal"" tariffs and says they are meant to match the taxes or duties that other countries place on U.S. goods, as well as nontariff barriers that supposedly disadvantage U.S. companies. In the case of Canada, Mr. Trump’s administration has pointed to dairy products, the goods and services tax, lumber and the digital-services tax Ottawa imposed last year. Mr. Carney on Friday announced a tariff relief package for workers and companies hurt by trade conflict both with the United States and China. Beijing has imposed steep tariffs on Canadian pork, canola oil, peas and seafood in retaliation for Ottawa slapping levies on Chinese-made electric vehicles last year after the United States did the same.

Pierre Poilievre kicks off Conservative election campaign under shadow of Trump’s trade war:   The Conservative Leader’s double-digit polling lead over the Liberals has shrunk to within the margin of error since Trump’s election,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre ran for the Conservative Party leadership nearly three years ago saying he was running to be prime minister – and on Sunday, he began that bid in earnest with the start of the general election campaign. Standing on a rooftop adjacent to the Canadian Museum of History on a cold Sunday morning in Gatineau, Que., Mr. Poilievre cast back to his roots as the adopted son of two schoolteachers who raised him on a promise of a country that he now believes is at risk. His theme for this election is to restore that promise. He’ll campaign under the slogan of Canada First, and a drive to ensure that the Liberals do not win a fourth term with their new leader Mark Carney. But the ground underneath his long-standing argument that Liberal economic, social and environmental policies have done more harm to the country than good has shifted markedly in recent months. His double-digit polling lead over the Liberals has shrunk to within the margin of error with a new Liberal leader and a trade war with the United States. The ballot-box question that Mr. Poilievre thought he’d campaign on in 2025 – the Trudeau Liberals’ record – has been cast aside and replaced by a question centred on which party leader is best to take on the Trump administration and stand up against the U.S. President. Mr. Poilievre acknowledged the fears and anger that Donald Trump has caused. ""I share your anger and I share the worry for our future, but I also draw great resolve in knowing that we can transform the anxiety and anger into action,"" he said in his opening remarks. He said he respects the office of the President of the United States, and noted that Americans buy 75 per cent of Canadian goods. Whoever is prime minister, he said, will have to deal with Mr. Trump, because he is going to be around for four years. ""You can be respectful and firm, and I believe we have to be both. I will insist the President recognize the independence and sovereignty of Canada,"" Mr. Poilievre said in answer to reporters as his wife, Anaida, and son Cruz looked on from a bench on the rooftop. ""I will insist that he stop tariffing our nation. And at the same time, I will strengthen our country so that we can be capable of standing on our own two feet and standing up to the Americans where and when necessary. That’s what it means when I say, ‘let’s put Canada first for a change.’ "" Mr. Trump has said in recent days that he believes he’d be better off with a Liberal in power, and has said Mr. Poilievre is no friend of his. Vice-President JD Vance, however, is close friends with Conservative MP Jamil Jivani. But polls suggest that Canadians do see points of comparison between Mr. Trump and Mr. Poilievre, and in a recent interview with American conservative news outlet Breitbart, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith listed off ways she thinks Mr. Poilievre and the Trump administration align. She also told the outlet that the trade war was benefiting the incumbent Liberals and said she asked the U.S. administration to back off for the duration of the election and wait for Mr. Poilievre to get elected. ""The perspective that Pierre would bring would be very much in sync with, I think, the new direction in America,"" she said, according to a recording of the interview. ""And I think we’d have a really great relationship for the period of time they’re both in."" Mr. Poilievre didn’t directly answer a question Sunday about whether her interventions were appropriate. He was also asked what he says to Canadians who look at Mr. Poilievre’s promises such as cuts to foreign aid and cuts to the public service and see negative parallels to some of Mr. Trump’s controversial agenda. In French he answered, ""I’m Canadian."" In English, Mr. Poilievre said that when he promises to cut taxes, increase natural-resource production and create jobs, it is ""bad news"" for the President, because it means Canada will become more self-reliant and sovereign. Mr. Poilievre followed his opening news conference with a trip to his home riding of Carleton to open a campaign office, and from there was expected to travel to the Toronto area for the first rally of his election campaign.

"Is Poilievre the new Trudeau?:   In a recurring feature, Susan Delacourt, a small-l liberal, and Matt Gurney, a small-c conservative, bring their different perspectives - and shared commitment to civil disagreement - to the political debates of the moment.",2025.0,"MG Well, here we are. Yay, I guess. There goes our April. For the one or two readers who haven't heard, Susan and I are writing this when an election call is believed to be imminent. This will probably hit the presses as one is called. There's so many angles to get started with, but here's one I'm not sure will get a ton of attention: the NDP is facing a catastrophe, if the polls are accurate. We'll have weeks to chat Liberals and Tories, but let's take a minute now at the outset, to ask, hey, Jagmeet Singh, how'd that confidence and supply deal work out with the Liberals? SD I'm actually looking forward to this election, so yay for real. Singh may be feeling a bit like Bob Rae did back in 1997 when, as the Ontario NDP leader, he worked with the provincial Liberals in a formal accord after the 1985 election. Ontarians rewarded the Liberals with a majority. I'm not saying a Liberal majority is in sight, but you're right that the NDP is probably very nervous about the polls. But who isn't? I'm trying to figure out which party should be more afraid of this crazy volatility in the polls these past weeks, the likes of which pollsters tell us they've never seen before. MG The Conservatives are obviously unhappy with their numbers. I've never seen anything like this. It's like Pierre Poilievre casually let slip around five weeks ago that he was an al-Qaeda second-in-command that the U.S. drones had somehow missed. The polling reset is brutal on its own, but it's the directionality that's really alarming if you're the Tories - it's not clear they've hit bottom yet. The Liberals, though, are probably about as baffled as Poilievre is - they can't be confident that Mark Carney's numbers are as robust as they seem to be. The risk they've chosen to take is that even if they aren't, it'll take longer than four or five weeks for us all to find out. Could work! But it's a massive risk. SD Do you think the Liberals have a chance of winning? I confess, whenever I hear this, I remain skeptical. MG Oh wow, we're doing a bit of role reversal here. Gotta keep the editors on their toes. I can see them now, going, ""Did we get the Gurney and Delacourt grafs mixed up?"" But yes, the Liberals can absolutely win this. I'm not going to bet the family farm on it, but I believed the polls showing Poilievre ahead, and I believe the polls showing Carney overtaking him. I also believe - and he'd hate to hear this - that Poilievre has actually become a lot like Trudeau in a way that may be his undoing. SD I'm curious to hear more about that. And yes, to revert to my old self, I have long believed, based on deeper poll reading, that some of the Conservative lead was parked votes among people who just couldn't vote for Justin Trudeau anymore. There was no Poilievre-mania sweeping the nation. So all that volatility in the opinion standings is evidence of voters getting unparked, and a lot of them at the same time. Now tell me how Poilievre is like Trudeau. MG Well, first let me say, I do think there was actually some Poilievre-mania. I'm probably going to regret saying that. It'll get clipped on social media and thrown at me for years to come. But the Conservatives did open up huge leads in unusual demographics, and the rallies Poilievre was holding were, according to much older political animals than me, unusually large and excited. That's a data point. But here's how Poilievre is like Trudeau: he's slow to recognize danger and slower still to respond to it. In the end, I think that's what wrecked Trudeau's government. It may be in the middle of wrecking Poilievre's electoral prospects right now. SD You know how Poilievre is like Trudeau these days? He's talking to Premier Doug Ford! It's well known that Ford had a much better relationship with Trudeau than he did with Poilievre. We've been told the two leaders don't even know each other and there's lots of tension between federal and Ontario conservatives. When I learned this week that the federal Conservative leader did outreach with Ford, I thought, OK, that seals it. Poilievre is very nervous. MG I saw that story. I laughed. It brought to mind an old saying I heard once: ""When you're on top of the world ... don't pee."" Poilievre and his team don't think much of Ford and haven't really ever tried to hide it. You're right. That call wouldn't happen if the Conservative party wasn't nervous. And the premier's apparently muted response also tells us something about how Ford assesses the state of play, no? SD Absolutely. Now let me slip on my Gurney disguise again and say why the Liberals should be nervous, too. This poll surge for Carney has to be great for morale, but it's also a cautionary tale: easy come, easy go in this climate. Carney and his team have to pull off a campaign that's almost mistake-free to finish as high in the standings as they seem to be now. But mistake-free campaigns are rare, as you and I both know. MG And we've already seen Carney underperform under questioning. Let's be blunt. He's a rookie who's about to go up against a group of seasoned opponents at a time of absolute political and geopolitical chaos. There's about a million ways he could screw this up, or have something screw it up for him, absolutely. But even a month or two ago, the idea that that kind of luck would be something the Conservatives would be praying for would have seemed nuts. Maybe it is nuts. We're all just going to have to keep up as best we can. SD But we finally have an election. Yay! MG Yeah. Yay. There goes my golf trip. Thanks, Carney.

"Kelly McParland: Sorry folks, but Poilievre's fate rests with Ontario",2025.0,"Let's say, if just for the sake of argument, that the outcome of the federal election depends on how the vote goes in Ontario. Because that's the way it usually goes, and nothing in the dynamics of this campaign suggests there's a compelling reason to expect it to be different. Conservative Leder Pierre Poilievre can sweep all of Alberta and the best he'll pick up is two Liberal seats. Ontario has 74 Liberals, more than three times the total for all of western Canada. That being the case, Poilievre has considerable work to do to if he wants the province to help make him prime minister. An Ipsos poll taken last June showed Poilievre's forces with an overwhelming lead among voters. Nationally they boasted 42 per cent support, against 24 per cent for the Liberals and 18 per cent for the NDP. A reading by the same firm this month has the Liberals at 42 per cent, Conservatives at 36 per cent and New Democrats at just 10 per cent. Other polling firms reflected similar findings. The web site 338Canada, which projects results based on a range of data, now has the Liberals winning 178 seats, six more than needed for a majority. The numbers are startling by any reckoning, but particularly so for Ontario, where Conservatives led by 18-20 points in June. That was the month of the St. Paul's byelection, a supposedly safe Liberal seat the Tories snatched in a result the CBC deemed ""stunning,"" ""unexpected"" and ""far-reaching."" And thus it was. That same month, a majority of Canadians said they still expected Justin Trudeau to fight the next election. By December he was toast, announcing his resignation after being abandoned by finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who oversaw the fight in St. Paul's and suffered an internal party whispering campaign for her efforts. Ontario figures now show Liberals and Tories in a dead heat, with New Democrats falling off a cliff. Polls, of course, are not holy writ, but the uniformity of the findings across so many surveys suggests its safe to conclude Poilievre's standing in Ontario was never a love affair, but the result of a marriage gone sour. Ontarians didn't favour Poilievre so much as they'd come to detest Trudeau. They wanted him gone, and if supporting Conservatives was the best way to achieve his departure, they'd make do with Conservatives. But Trudeau is gone now. The boil has been lanced. A Trudeauless Liberal party doesn't annoy Ontario the way his ongoing presence did. Poilievre has to accept that reality, and retool his message appropriately if he aims to regain lost ground. Even as the election begins, there's no real evidence he's willing to do that. Tory messaging remains consistent: Liberals are all the same, a Carney government would be a continuation of the Trudeau government, Carney is just like Justin, after nine years of failure and disappointment why vote for more of the same? It's an argument that worked well as long as Trudeau was around to act as target, but has yet to prove effective against Carney. For one thing, there are too many glaring differences between the men. Trudeau was born into Canadian aristocracy, a wealthy princeling who lived off inherited wealth and the fame of his father. Carney comes from authentic middle class, the son of a high school principal and a homemaker mother, born in the Northwest Territories, raised in Edmonton. Trudeau dabbled for a living, teaching a bit, giving speeches, studying here and there, never really finding a career until entering politics largely on name recognition. Carney earned his way up the ladder in the private sector. His wealth is his own, the result of his own efforts, though he needs to do a better job of explaining what he has and where it comes from. Trudeau was glitz and glam, Carney definitely is not. Trudeau at a microphone was bafflegab and avoidance, much verbiage with little content. If anything, Carney seems to suffer from a compulsion to actually answer questions, which comes across as dullness and gets him into trouble in the form of snippiness when he gets impatient. The longer the exposure to Trudeau, the shallower he seemed. Carney is an egghead, lacking his predecessor's photogeneity but perhaps also the triteness that came to go with it. I could be wrong, but I don't think efforts to smear Carney in campaign ads or on the stump will be enough to garner the votes Tories need in Ontario, where the overwhelming issue is no longer Trudeau, it's Trump. Premier Doug Ford was just re-elected to an overwhelming third majority while leading a high-profile battle against the threats and insults pouring forth from Washington. Through regular appearances on American television, blunt denunciations of Trumpism on the president's favourite networks, pledges to shut off electricity exports to U.S. customers, personal lobbying of U.S. authorities and a high-priced ad campaign denouncing the threat of tariffs, Ford has established himself as easily the most high-profile Conservative anti-Trumper, despite the president himself declaring he'd rather face a Liberal government than deal with Poilievre, who he says is ""stupidly no friend of mine."" While Poilievre and Ford have never been close and the premier has shown no interest in involving himself in the federal campaign, he met with Carney in his first week on the job, sharing breakfast with the new prime minister at a Toronto neighbourhood grill. He is also famously friendly with Freeland, inviting her to his house for coffee and inviting her as a special guest to his latest swearing-in ceremony. Poilievre has few friends in the corporate towers around Toronto's Bay Street, making clear his disdain for ""suits"" over ""boots,"" denouncing bankers and business types as ""gutless executives"" forever ""sucking up to anti-resource, high-tax, big-government politicians,"" attending pointless luncheons and flooding the capital with useless lobbyists he refuses to meet. Nothing says you have to be popular with corporate chieftains to win an election, but Ontario sees itself as the financial heart of the country and views events in Washington as overwhelmingly the election's most pressing issue. If the economy is the key to this election, and the U.S. is the greatest threat to it, a prime minister who can't get along with Canada's most powerful business leaders, entrepreneurs and employers may not be the the obvious choice. Like it or not, Poilievre needs the province in his win column. In particular he needs to steal Liberal ridings in the narrow corridor bordering Lake Ontario from Niagara Falls to Oshawa that might as well be renamed the Liberal Horseshoe for all the presence Conservatives enjoy. Half the province lives there and is the reason Liberals have dominated Ottawa for so long. If Poilievre hopes too best Carney, he'll have to find a way to do it there.

"How Poilievre is trying to keep the election about the Liberals, not Donald Trump",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump upended Canada's trade relationship with its closest neighbour, but also the affordability fight Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants to have in the next election. Soaring Conservative confidence has now been tempered by the departure of Justin Trudeau and the upheaval south of the border, two events that have collapsed Poilievre's 20-point lead in the polls, with some surveys now suggesting he is trailing Prime Minister Mark Carney. In the lead up to Sunday's election call, anxiety and confusion has set in among some Conservatives, including within Poilievre's office, over how the leader is navigating the current moment and what an election campaign overshadowed by an unpredictable U.S. president may bring. How much that post-Trudeau reality has sunk in - and will stick - for Poilievre remains an open question, given his long held confidence that he can drive his own message and the brand he has built for himself as having unchanged views in politics after 20 years. ""I believe that the biggest challenge for Mr. Poilievre is focusing on all those things that he is going to do and focusing less on Mark Carney,"" said Dimitri Soudas, a former director of communications for Stephen Harper, the country's most recent Conservative prime minister. ""This is a change election. So truly, all you need to do is lay out your change agenda and all you need to say is, 'You know, these guys have had 10 years.'"" To understand where the party finds itself and what it must do to win, National Post spoke with more than a dozen Conservatives, including strategists, party activists, MPs and veteran campaigners. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly about the situation. For the past two months, there have been internal debates around the merits of Poilievre sticking with his call for a ""carbon tax election"" and pushing his ""axe the tax"" message, which some Conservatives believe has staying power as a larger rallying cry for cost-of-living issues. Last month, Poilievre debuted his response to Canadians worried about the Canada-U.S. relationship at a packed ""Canada First"" rally in downtown Ottawa. He delivered a speech linking the economic situation the country finds itself back to the past nine years of Liberal rule. He has kept hammering that point since, while at the same time not abandoning the slogans and pocketbook issues Conservatives have successfully championed, including the carbon tax, which he revisited earlier in the week, even after Carney announced he was reducing the consumer tax rate to zero, beginning April 1. Poilievre's announcement that he would scrap the industrial carbon tax came after his office had in fact been considering keeping it. The Conservative leader himself had offered support for Alberta's model in past speeches in the House of Commons. The politics of the moment, however, changed the calculation. Should gas prices fall by 18 cents a litre as estimated once Carney's change takes effect in April, the push to ""axe the tax"" will lose its effectiveness, some sources say. ""It just seems like they're very unsure of themselves,"" one insider said. ""There's no narrative."" All of this has led to some members of his entourage recently making it clear to Poilievre: He is no longer in the lead. That, one senior Conservative source suggested, has pushed the 45-year-old leader to reach out to people outside his tight circle of usual confidants to seek advice on how to best take on Carney. Poilievre has sought input on his campaign pitch from multiple caucus members, former advisers and even Ontario Premier Doug Ford, which resulted in a media report that Ford had rebuffed Poilievre but that both men disputed on Friday. Poilievre has also been working the phone with candidates who have been out door knocking and helping produce the slickly made videos the party plans to release with each new policy promise. In public, Poilievre has adopted a less biting tone and ratcheted down his attacks against Carney, who the party has running been ads against, painting him as ""sneaky."" Campaign material sent to candidates still features familiar attacks against the new Liberal leader, branding the party the ""Carney-Trudeau Liberals,"" saying they are responsible for ""out-of-control immigration"" and support for ""job-killing carbon taxes."" Poilievre's main tag line for the campaign remains ""bring it home,"" with the material featuring other well-known slogans of ""stop the crime"" and ""fix the budget."" Overshadowing the Conservatives' point that the Liberals are responsible for the economic vulnerability Canada faces and the price of food and housing remaining too high, especially for those under 40, is that, in the shadow of Trump, voters may choose to stick with what they know and deliver the Liberals a fourth mandate - a rarity in Canadian politics. ""In times of crisis, people like incumbencies,"" said Scott Lamb, who served as the Conservative party's president from 2016 to 2021, comparing the situation to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is noise in the system because people will be distracted, ultimately, from the things that they're unhappy with for only so long."" Getting Canadians to focus on the Liberal record instead will be Poilievre's task for the campaign. Election day could either be April 28 or May 5, with it widely anticipated that the Liberals will opt for the shortest legally allowed timeframe to take advantage of the party's surge in the polls. In advance of that, Poilievre has begun pitching himself as the agent for change by calling the preceding years ""the lost Liberal decade."" Nova Scotia Sen. Michael MacDonald suggest Liberals prefer to run against Trump, which is serving as a distraction. He also dismissed Trump's comments on annexing Canada as simply ""rhetoric."" ""The election's about the economy, it's not about Donald Trump,"" he told National Post. ""Donald Trump's not running Canada,"" he said. ""Donald Trump didn't run Canada into the ground."" Heading into the campaign, the Liberal party released new ads pitching Carney, a two-time central banker, as having the economic experience to stand up against Trump's tariffs, countering Poilievre's ""Canada First"" message with Carney's pledge to keep ""Canada Strong."" Behind-the-scenes, the Conservatives, who have long called for an election, have been busy staffing up a war room, with exact jobs still being defined, and dispatching Parliament Hill staffers to act as campaign mangers for candidates. In battleground ridings, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, which is key to win for forming government, the focus is also on the plummeting support for the NDP, as their supporters look to the Carney-led Liberals. A two-way race between the Tories and Liberals could spell trouble for the Conservatives, which have historically depended on New Democrats splitting the left-of-centre vote for victory. Jenni Bryne, Poilievre's top adviser, and the Conservatives' national campaign director, notified media this week that reporters would not be permitted to travel with Poilievre on the campaign, breaking with longstanding tradition of how media outlets provide federal election coverage for Canadians. (They pay their own way.) As Poilievre prepares to hit the hustings, a complaint mentioned on the doorsteps and in calls MPs have been making to voters has been around his tone, especially for older voters, wary of Trump. He has also received feedback that he is not talking enough about the U.S. president. When confronted with concerns about Poilievre and Trump, one candidate said they point to how Trump himself has said Poilievre is not a ""MAGA guy"" and suggests that his style may be exactly what is needed to go toe-to-toe with Trump. It is the explanation Poilievre himself has given to voters, at least to those in Quebec through a new ad where he admits his style is seen as ""too direct"" and ""too blunt."" The Conservatives were quick to embrace Trump's most recent comments that he would rather have a Liberal in office than Poilievre. Speaking at an event on Friday, Poilievre also made it clear what he sees as the question Canadians will answer in the coming election. ""Do we want a fourth term of Liberals who block resources, tax our people, drive up our costs, unleash crime in our community and make us weak and defenceless facing the Americans, or do we want put Canada first for a change."" Poilievre will soon find out.

Poilievre says Smith's energy asks 'reasonable'; But no promises,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Friday that a list of energy-related demands put out by Alberta Premier Danielle Smith was ""very reasonable"" but wouldn't commit to meeting them all if he becomes prime minister. ""You'll have to see the rest of our platform roll out in due course,"" Poilievre told reporters, speaking at a campaign-style announcement in suburban Ottawa. Smith released a list of nine non-negotiable demands concerning the province's oil and gas sector shortly after meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney in Edmonton on Thursday. She warned that whomever becomes Canada's prime minister after the imminent federal election must meet the demands within the first six months of his mandate or face an ""unprecedented national unity crisis."" ""Albertans will no longer tolerate the way we've been treated by the federal Liberals over the past 10 years,"" wrote Smith, addressing all federal leaders. Poilievre has already said he'd meet some of Smith's demands, such as scrapping the federal cap on oil and gas emissions and ceding total control over industrial carbon pricing to the provinces.

"Poilievre, Ford deny report on call for help; 'Not Accurate'",2025.0,"OTTAWA . Both Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford are denying a report suggesting the federal leader asked the premier for help on the forthcoming election campaign, but was rebuffed. ""The report is not accurate,"" Poilievre told reporters during a news conference at a union local in suburban Ottawa Friday morning. In French, he added that he had an ""excellent"" conversation with Ford. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers when they want to talk, and we talked about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production, and reversing the lost Liberal decade,"" he added, reprising many of his recent policy announcements. A Toronto Star report on Thursday cited unnamed sources who said the Conservative leader called Ford on Monday and asked him for advice on the approaching federal election. According to the Star, Ford declined to provide any guidance and told Poilievre he was focused on leading Ontario and would stay out of the federal race. The Star story said there has been no love lost between the two camps for years, with many in Poilievre's entourage saying Ford's Progressive Conservatives don't govern enough from the right. Later on Friday in Toronto, Ford went even further than Poilievre, and said the federal leader did not ask him for advice and the Star story was wrong. ""It was the first time I ever spoke to him. I guess what was reported was not accurate at all,"" Ford said. ""He didn't ask me for help ... so I don't know where they came up with that story."" Both leaders dodged questions about the revelations that the tone of the call was ""stilted and awkward,"" and that Ford's entourage was annoyed Poilievre did not congratulate the premier for his election win on Feb. 27. ""I want to see how each leader is going to protect Ontario. Are they going to get the Ring of Fire moving forward. Are they going to get out of the way and make sure we get into the critical minerals?"" Ford told reporters. ""Times have changed now. We're in an economic war with the largest country in the world and we have to get to those critical minerals as quickly as possible,"" he added. During his Friday news conference, Poilievre announced a Conservative government would maintain a $4,000 apprenticeship grant that helps apprentices cover the cost of training in their trade. He also promised funding for union training halls to help cover the cost of equipment and programs. A third promise was to create a ""special rapid class"" of employment insurance that would accelerate applications for tradespeople who step away from their work for additional training. ""Right now, they have to wait weeks on end without any money coming in as they're training up, and that puts them in a tough spot paying the rent,"" Poilievre said. The Conservative leader also took a swipe at Prime Minister Mark Carney, accusing him of being a ""union buster "" because of the actions of certain divisions of Brookfield Asset Management while he chaired the company's board of directors. ""Mark Carney will never stand up for the working people. He will only stand up for the millionaire and billionaire global elites. That is all he has ever done,"" Poilievre charged. The prime minister has not yet responded to Poilievre's ""union buster"" insult, but was expected to address the media after he meets with the premiers Friday night in Ottawa. Carney is expected to visit Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Sunday to request that she dissolve Parliament so he can launch a snap federal election.

"Poilievre keeping it about the liberals, not trump; Election",2025.0,"Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump upended Canada's trade relationship with its closest neighbour, but also the affordability fight Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants to have in the next election. Soaring Conservative confidence has now been tempered by the departure of Justin Trudeau and the upheaval south of the border, two events that have collapsed Poilievre's 20-point lead in the polls, with some surveys now suggesting he is trailing Prime Minister Mark Carney. In the lead up to Sunday's election call, anxiety and confusion has set in among some Conservatives, including within Poilievre's office, over how the leader is navigating the current moment and what an election campaign overshadowed by an unpredictable U.S. president may bring. How much that post-Trudeau reality has sunk in - and will stick - for Poilievre remains an open question, given his long held confidence that he can drive his own message and the brand he has built for himself as having unchanged views in politics after 20 years. ""I believe that the biggest challenge for Mr. Poilievre is focusing on all those things that he is going to do and focusing less on Mark Carney,"" said Dimitri Soudas, a former director of communications for Stephen Harper, the country's most recent Conservative prime minister. ""This is a change election. So truly, all you need to do is lay out your change agenda and all you need to say is, 'You know, these guys have had 10 years.' "" To understand where the party finds itself and what it must do to win, National Post spoke with more than a dozen Conservatives, including strategists, party activists, MPs and veteran campaigners. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly about the situation. For the past two months, there have been internal debates around the merits of Poilievre sticking with his call for a ""carbon tax election"" and pushing his ""axe the tax"" message, which some Conservatives believe has staying power as a larger rallying cry for cost-of-living issues. Last month, Poilievre debuted his response to Canadians worried about the Canada-U.S. relationship at a packed ""Canada First"" rally in downtown Ottawa. He delivered a speech linking the economic situation the country finds itself back to the past nine years of Liberal rule. He has kept hammering that point since, while at the same time not abandoning the slogans and pocketbook issues Conservatives have successfully championed, including the carbon tax, which he revisited earlier in the week, even after Carney announced he was reducing the consumer tax rate to zero, beginning April 1. Poilievre's announcement that he would scrap the industrial carbon tax came after his office had in fact been considering keeping it. The Conservative leader himself had offered support for Alberta's model in past speeches in the House of Commons. The politics of the moment, however, changed the calculation. Should gas prices fall by 18 cents a litre as estimated once Carney's change takes effect in April, the push to ""axe the tax"" will lose its effectiveness, some sources say. ""It just seems like they're very unsure of themselves,"" one party insider said. ""There's no narrative."" All of this has led to some members of his entourage recently making it clear to Poilievre: He is no longer in the lead. That, one senior Conservative source suggested, has pushed the 45-year-old leader to reach out to people outside his tight circle of usual confidants to seek advice on how to best take on Carney. Poilievre has sought input on his campaign pitch from several caucus members, former advisers and even Ontario Premier Doug Ford, which resulted in a media report that Ford had rebuffed Poilievre but that both men disputed on Friday. Poilievre has also been working the phone with candidates who have been out door knocking and helping produce the slickly made videos the party plans to release with each new policy promise. In public, Poilievre has adopted a less biting tone and ratcheted down his attacks against Carney, who the party has running been running ads against, painting him as ""sneaky."" Campaign material sent to candidates still features familiar attacks against the new Liberal leader, branding the party the ""Carney-Trudeau Liberals,"" saying they are responsible for ""out-of-control immigration"" and support for ""job-killing carbon taxes."" Poilievre's main tag line for the campaign remains ""bring it home,"" with the material featuring other well-known slogans of ""stop the crime"" and ""fix the budget."" Overshadowing the Conservatives' point that the Liberals are responsible for the economic vulnerability Canada faces and the price of food and housing remaining too high, especially for those under 40, is that, in the shadow of Trump, voters may choose to stick with what they know and deliver the Liberals a fourth mandate - a rarity in Canadian politics. ""In times of crisis, people like incumbencies,"" said Scott Lamb, who served as the Conservative party's president from 2016 to 2021, comparing the situation to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is noise in the system because people will be distracted, ultimately, from the things that they're unhappy with for only so long."" Getting Canadians to focus on the Liberal record instead will be Poilievre's task for the campaign. Election day could either be April 28 or May 5, with it widely anticipated that the Liberals will opt for the shortest legally allowed time frame to take advantage of the party's surge in the polls. In advance of that, Poilievre has begun pitching himself as the agent for change by calling the preceding years ""the lost Liberal decade."" Nova Scotia Sen. Michael MacDonald suggests Liberals prefer to run against Trump, which is serving as a distraction. He also dismissed Trump's comments on annexing Canada as simply ""rhetoric."" ""The election's about the econo- my, it's not about Donald Trump,"" he told National Post. ""Donald Trump's not running Canada,"" he said. ""Donald Trump didn't run Canada into the ground."" Heading into the campaign, the Liberal party released new ads pitching Carney, a two-time central banker, as having the economic experience to stand up against Trump's tariffs, countering Poilievre's ""Canada First"" message with Carney's pledge to keep ""Canada Strong."" Behind-the-scenes, the Conservatives, who have long called for an election, have been busy staffing up a war room, with exact jobs yet to be defined, and dispatching Parliament Hill staffers to act as campaign mangers for candidates. In battleground ridings, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, which is key to win for forming government, the focus is also on the plummeting support for the NDP, as their supporters look to the Carney-led Liberals. A two-way race between the Tories and Liberals could spell trouble for the Conservatives, which have historically depended on New Democrats splitting the left-ofcentre vote for victory. Jenni Bryne, Poilievre's top adviser, and the Conservatives' national campaign director, notified media this week that reporters would not be permitted to travel with Poilievre on the campaign, breaking with long-standing tradition of how media outlets provide federal election coverage for Canadians. (They pay their own way.) As Poilievre prepares to hit the hustings, a complaint mentioned on the doorsteps and in calls MPs have been making to voters has been around his tone, especially for older voters, wary of Trump. He has also received feedback that he is not talking enough about the U.S. president. When confronted with concerns about Poilievre and Trump, one candidate said they point to how Trump himself has said Poilievre is not a ""MAGA guy"" and suggests that his style may be exactly what is needed to go toe-to-toe with Trump. Poilievre will soon find out.

"Read an excerpt from Ripper: The Making of Pierre Poilievre:   Mark Bourrie’s biography of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre delves into his upbringing, his election in 2004 and his eventual leadership campaign. Here’s an excerpt from the book",2025.0,"The Charles Taylor Prize-winning Mark Bourrie ( Bushrunner ) biography of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre delves into his upbringing in 1980s Calgary, his election in 2004 to the riding of Nepean-Carleton before it was reconfigured as Carleton and his eventual leadership campaign. Here’s an excerpt from the book. _________ Pierre Poilievre has better political instincts than the journalists and politics watchers who generate conventional wisdom. He understood Carleton’s past as a safe Tory seat and could do simple math. Door-to-door canvassing convinced Poilievre the seat was winnable – if Martin’s minority fell. The Liberals only held the seat because of the Reform–Progressive Conservative split. Now this was behind them. This wasn’t clear to local Tories, so the nomination was truly wide open, without risk of the party appointing a star candidate. Still, five local people went for it. Several were longtime local politicians, and the man who’d run for the Alliance against Pratt, Ed Mahfouz, was something of a hero to the large local Lebanese-Canadian community because of his fundraising work for their community organizations. He was also a good organizer whose supporters would show up to the nomination meeting. (Many people will pay the minimal membership fee to get a candidate to stop pestering them, with no intention of attending.) On the negative side of the ledger, Poilievre was not from the riding, though he lived in it. This probably counted less than it would have before Ottawa’s suburban sprawl overwhelmed much of the old farm community. Even Stockwell Day, still Poilievre’s boss, saw the nomination and the general-election campaigns as long shots. But being a newcomer in a suburban riding was less of a problem than it would have been in most rural ridings: many of the voters were new arrivals, too. Along with Poilievre’s willingness to work, he had a good team of local people, helped by Jonathan Denis, who had been Poilievre’s partner in their campaign management and polling business for more than a year and would soon be Poilievre’s partner in a Calgary rental property. They used old election-result data to identify parts of the riding with big conservative majorities and went door to door day and night repeating Poilievre’s campaign slogan that declared him a ""Rock Solid Conservative."" This slogan appealed to party members, who turned up to the nomination meeting, put up lawn signs, and opened their wallets. Poilievre won the nomination on the third ballot and immediately pivoted to running against Pratt. Pratt couldn’t keep up: he still had an important ministry that demanded some of his time. And, it appears, it took a while for him to take the young staffer’s campaign seriously. By the time he did, Poilievre had successfully tagged his opponent as ""Liberal Pratt,"" playing off the English insult. And Poilievre had convinced a lot of local conservatives that the riding was winnable, so a large team of volunteers, including John Baird and Lisa MacLeod, put their backs into his campaign. The nomination campaign should have opened the eyes of Liberals and pundits that Poilievre was a serious candidate. Unlike his opponents, he and his team went through old Progressive Conservative and Reform/Alliance party lists and worked hard to sign up lapsed members. He also went door to door and sold party memberships, which helped him become the Conservative candidate and introduced him to local voters, who’d usually never heard of him. Other candidates, at most, called up some of the old members. They didn’t realize the power of face-to-face campaigning. Ottawa Citizen columnist Ken Gray underestimated Poilievre as just a former Alberta resident ""who studied international relations at the University of Calgary."" The pride of Fenelon Falls, Jenni Byrne, was now ""from Ottawa."" She was his ""partner."" Their message was unfocused: Poilievre said he was running because of cuts to health care, which is a provincial responsibility.10 (After 2004, Poilievre’s concern about health care seems to have been limited to getting a rent break from the federal government for the Queensway Carleton Hospital, in the west end of Ottawa.) There were the rest of the usual Poilievre beefs: the Liberals took too much in taxes, and they’d thrown away millions on the national long-gun registry and the crooked Quebec sponsorship contracts.11 The government was soft on crime. Poilievre told Gray the parole and bail systems had to be fixed and said repeat offenders over the age of fourteen should be tried in adult court. Although he didn’t like capital punishment, he’d vote for it if the voters of Nepean–Carleton wanted him to. Speaking about Paul Martin and the Liberal regime that had been in power for eleven years, Poilievre said, with some accuracy: ""This is a tired old government proving every day that it has got to go. People are looking for new blood on Parliament Hill … Taxes are a big concern to people. They are a burden on any middle-class family."" Baird, still a provincial cabinet minister, was going door to door with the twenty-four-year-old federal candidate. ""People will have to decide what they want,"" Baird said. ""The community is ready for change."" Although Paul Martin was struggling in the national campaign, pundits believed until election night that Nepean–Carleton was a safe Liberal seat. Even the conservative Ottawa Citizen endorsed Pratt (with some praise for Poilievre) and expected him to win. Pratt was more mature, both in age and in attitude. He’d travelled the world on sensitive military and human-rights missions before he was put in charge of Canada’s military. He’d started to expand the size and spending of the armed forces, and a lot of that money was supposed to end up in the pockets of the voters of Nepean–Carleton. But other numbers that the pundits hadn’t noticed were at work: Pratt won the seat in 2000 with 41.2 percent of the vote. The Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives, who were still running separate candidates, combined for 53.4 percent of the ballots. NDP and Green Party support was minimal. And now, with the right united, Pratt had to win over some small-c conservative voters who hadn’t supported him before or he’d lose the seat. In an interview with a Hill Times reporter, Poilievre described Nepean–Carleton as a ""rock solid conservative"" riding. ""I believe that Nepean–Carleton needs a rock-solid Conservative voice in the House of Commons. Yes [the merger influenced my decision to run] in two ways: One, I believe the candidacy is much more attractive now that we have a broader tent and two, it’s especially important to me that this new party retain rock solid conservative values and the only way to do that is to have candidates who are rock solid conservatives and that’s who I am."" Using ""rock-solid Conservative"" three times in one quote showed how he made this slogan an important part of his campaign. Still, Parliament Hill reporters didn’t take Poilievre and his campaign seriously, when they noticed it at all. The Tories, they believed, had picked the wrong candidate. He was one of the odd ducks that hung around with unpopular people like Ezra Levant and Rob Anders. How could an established politician be beaten by a mouthy young political staffer who had just moved to the riding and had never been much more than a student political animal? Pratt was a powerful minister, popular with the Hill crowd, so how could Carleton voters toss him out? These reporters didn’t realize all politics are local. Outside downtown Ottawa, eastern Ontario is very conservative. Local political hero Baird, still a member of the Ontario legislature but now a performative opposition MPP with a mean mouth, was behind Poilievre. Baird’s provincial riding matched the federal district. Baird was twenty-four, the same age as Poilievre, when he was first elected to Queen’s Park in 1995, and he provided a fine example of how a young politician could succeed by being annoying but well-focusedon things his constituents care about. Both men found issues that worked. Even though he was a provincial politician who had no say in issues of war and peace, Baird staked out the traditional conservative claim of support of the military. Canadian soldiers were being killed in Afghanistan, and Baird had done an end run around Pratt by having a local freeway declared ""Veterans Memorial Highway."" Poilievre sought out voter anger and anxiety. Suburban Ottawa federal bureaucrats tend to be unilingual, which hobbles their chances of advancing far in their career. A lot of people in the riding would like a federal job but don’t have a chance because most modern job postings require some level of bilingualism. Poilievre explained away his French name and promised to push for job opportunities for anglophones. His political antennae picked up voters’ concerns about the O-Train, the LRT commuter system that smelled of a boondoggle. The young candidate was able to convince people that a fast train that would take them from a big suburb of Ottawa to the city’s downtown was a bad idea. Poilievre turned twenty-five during that campaign. He had a motivated and loyal team who helped fix a few of his shortcomings. They threw Poilievre a birthday party at his campaign office in the rich satellite village of Manotick where, Poilievre told an Ottawa Citizen reporter, ""a bunch of the ladies on the campaign actually bought me some clothes because they thought I was very badly dressed … I was out of university, and I hadn’t really … mastered my wardrobe at all."" Still, though he’d done the Reform-Conservative math, Poilievre tried to manage expectations. He told his parents he expected to lose ""because I didn’t want them to be disappointed if I did. I thought I had a good chance of winning but I knew there was an equally good chance that I wouldn’t."" Near the end of the campaign, Poilievre began to feel much more confident and started telling people that he was going to win. Poilievre had a poll from Hollinshead Research Institute headed by Frank Hall that showed him way ahead. ""We are winning. The poll that came out … showed that we have two-to-one margin over our Liberal opponent. We feel very good about that. People in the riding believe that it’s time for change,"" Poilievre told a news reporter. ""After a decade of Liberal corruption, mismanagement and waste, people understand that they cannot have a representation from a Liberal MP."" With so many things in his favor—the public desire to hurt the Liberals (who were returned to power with a minority), Baird’s help, the ""ladies’"" sartorial aid, and the inherent conservativism of that part of the country—Poilievre beat Pratt by an impressive 5.6 percentage points. He hadn’t captured all the Progressive Conservative and Canadian Alliance votes of the 2000 election, but he’d got enough of them: 3,736 more than Pratt. The NDP and the Greens increased their numbers by 8 percent, suggesting some voters were unthrilled with either of the candidates who stood a serious chance of winning, but their votes didn’t matter. Poilievre was the first past the post, and not just by a nose. Copyright, Mark Bourrie, 2025. Published by the courtesy of Biblioasis.

Doug Ford's removal of Toronto bike lanes can start next week, court rules, March 14 Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house. U.S. President Donald Trump deserves criticism and ridicule for his actions, but we have our own politicians misbehaving at home. How about Toronto installing bike lanes to the tune of $27 million, and then Ontario demolishing them a few years later at a cost of $48 million? All without traffic and safety studies supporting the move. Fortunately, the provincial government has offered to pay for the demolition. I would suggest that it pay for the initial construction of the bike lanes, too. Of course, we would be paying that with our own tax dollars. Hasn't Toronto suffered enough from Premier Doug Ford's meddling? Ulla Colgrass, Toronto Boycotting U.S. products isn't so easy Diligently reading labels and trying to determine where fruit and vegetables originate can add a bit of time to my weekly grocery shopping, but I am determined not to buy produce from the United States. Yet this is difficult, as there is obvious confusion at our local stores. For example, there were recently three distinct bins containing lemons. One bin was selling lemons individually and the placard on the bin clearly indicated they were a ""Product of U.S.A."" I moved on and saw a placard on another bin, containing organic lemons in bulk in mesh bags. In the usual bold lettering, the placard read ""Organic Lemons - Product of Mexico."" I was relieved to see we had a choice. That is, until I picked up a bag of the Mexican lemons only to discover a much smaller label that read ""Product of U.S.A."" Later that day, I decided to venture to one of our town's other grocery stores out of curiosity (and because I still wanted to pick up some lemons). Entering the store, I went directly to the bin with the sign indicating ""Large Lemons - Product of Egypt."" Seeing nothing to suggest that these lemons were from anywhere but Egypt, I bought a few. Then, removing the tiny sticker on one of the lemons, I saw three letters underneath: ""U.S.A."" John Hinman, Cobourg, Ont. Trudeau's unsung accomplishment Justin Trudeau is leaving at one of his finest moments, March 9 Amid the praise for Justin Trudeau's contributions to Canada, one point was overlooked: having never lost an election, Trudeau retired undefeated - a rare accomplishment for a prime minister. Raymond Peringer, Toronto Let's give the word 'existential' a rest Pierre Poilievre has a bigger problem than Mark Carney. Much bigger, March 16 Can we please give the now-ubiquitous word ""existential"" a rest? It seems to be the current buzzword of the political and economic commentary we see in news media. Yet not all perceived dangers are existential threats or crises. Certainly, Canadians are feeling a threat to our very existence, as our economy and national identity sustain attacks from south of the border. But let's hit the pause button for a while as, like other overused words, ""existential"" is beginning to lose its meaning and effectiveness. Keith Spicer, Oakville Time for Ottawa to ditch the F-35 It would appear that more and more Canadians are encouraging the federal government to cancel the F-35 fighter jet contract. I'm sure there would be a penalty, but I say we pay the penalty and show the U.S. that there will be significant consequences for Trump's tariffs actions and threats to Canadian sovereignty. Mike Walker, Washago, Ont. How about a new northern alliance? Given the economic hostilities coming from the U.S., as well as our ongoing attempts to strengthen our trading ties with other countries, Canada should try to develop a stronger alliance with Denmark and Greenland. The latter is situated only a short distance from Canadian territory. This move would make sense from economic, strategic and security perspectives. We could create a northern bridge to Europe and blunt Trump's desire for Greenland. It's a win-win and a bit of spite, all at the same time. Gary Johnson, Stouffville Ford deserves a seat at trade talks in Washington While I disagreed with Premier Doug Ford's decision to call a snap election in February, I applaud him for the apparently positive outcome of his meeting with U.S. commerce chief Howard Lutnick in Washington, as well as for addressing the tariff issue on his own. Ford said the meeting was very productive, positive and civil on both sides, and he emphasized the importance of building relationships. Although the premier said he was looking forward to another meeting with Lutnick, we've now learned he will not be attending. Ford should participate in the meeting, as it was he who opened the gateway to negotiations. The prime minister would be welcome to join. Tina Maini, Hamilton Canada should look to Africa for export opportunities Prime Minister Mark Carney to visit France, U.K. for first foreign trip, March 15 Our new prime minister is visiting France and the United Kingdom in hopes of solidifying friendships and increasing our exports there. But is anyone thinking of Africa? As a continent of many developing countries, it is in need of increasing amounts of goods. China sold them $177 billion in goods in 2024, and that is a more than three per cent increase from the year before. The country has built 100,000 kilometres of Belt and Road railways through the continent to send in trains full of exports. When countries can't pay for the construction of the railways, China loans them money and, if they default, takes possession of the rails and the land they are on. Africa is another place where our attention needs to be. Gail Rutherford, Toronto What to do with all those U.S. flags? While I do think that the removal American flags from some Canadian border cities illustrates our anger and the sense of betrayal that we feel toward our neighbours, I believe flying their flags at half-mast would convey a more poignant message.

Poilievre is a victim of his own success,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre heads into the election campaign he's long demanded on Sunday fighting for his political life, a victim of his own success facing a remarkable change of circumstances. Poilievre spent two years fomenting anger against Justin Trudeau, blaming him for everything from the opioid crisis to inflation, pinning the blame on the Liberal leader's spending and his ""carbon tax."" Poilievre was so successful that his actions spurred a Liberal MP rebellion, Chrystia Freeland's public resignation and, ultimately, Trudeau's departure - a move many Conservatives believed he would never make. At the same time, Poilievre was eyeing NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's blue-collar base. For two years, Poilievre and his MPs attacked Singh's close association with the increasingly unpopular Grits, parroting more than 1,500 times in the House of Commons comments such as, ""After nine years of failures from the NDP-Liberal government ..."" to further cement that connection in the minds of voters. On social media, they highlight Singh's penchant for luxury items, suggesting he was a dishonest and selfish man whose only interest in keeping Parliament afloat was to qualify for his MP's pension. The NDP's confusing positioning over the past six months didn't help, but the Conservative hit job on Singh left him wounded and bloodied. Now, his party sits at nine to 12 per cent support in public opinion polls. Having destroyed his two main opponents, Poilievre has new challenges: NDP support is too low to allow vote splits on the centre-left; Liberal Leader Mark Carney is a threat on the centre-right; and U.S. President Donald Trump, who muses nearly daily about annexing Canada as his 51st state through economic destruction, has pushed the country toward a more collectivist approach that doesn't naturally benefit Poilievre. Carney's leadership has energized Liberal troops. At a time of increased economic anxiety, he is perceived by many voters as the right man for the times. Since he became leader on March 9, the Liberal party says more than 250 people across the country have expressed an interest in becoming candidates. Kelowna's Stephen Fuhr is one of them. He ran successfully in 2015 and believes the conditions are ripe for another win in a traditional Conservative seat. ""It's still going to be hard,"" he said over the phone. ""But Carney resonates here with progressive conservatives. He cares about climate change, and he's uniquely qualified to tackle the biggest issue we're facing right now,"" the former Liberal MP, who lost his house in the 2023 forest fires, said of the Trump threat. ""This election is going to come down to whether people recognize what's really at stake ... Pierre Poilievre isn't popular, and he's simply not capable. And I think people are going to have to put party politics aside and do what's best for the country."" That's the kind of message the Liberals want to stress. In his first week as prime minister, through his decision to eliminate the consumer carbon price, his trip to Europe and Iqaluit, and meetings with the premiers and Canada-U.S. advisory council, Carney was depicted as man of action, someone who listens to Canadians and has his eye on the bigger picture. The Liberals hope that in style and substance, Carney contrasts positively against Poilievre's aggressively partisan stance. But Poilievre is adjusting. He's adopted a softer tone and more grey hair. At the same time, he refuses to allow Carney to neutralize the Tories' most popular policy, the ""axe the tax"" slogan, by taking a victory lap over its defeat, instead doubling down by campaigning to remove the federal backstop on industrial carbon pricing - a move that threatens billions of dollars of investments and would make it impossible to reach Canada's climate targets. Poilievre may have misjudged support for the Conservatives when they led the polls by 25 percentage points as an endorsement of his approach rather than as an anti-Trudeau vote, but he knows Carney is now riding high in the polls on a fluid vote. Those who say they'll vote for Carney base their support on what they think they know about him, rather than what they have seen of him. That's a risk for the Liberals and an opportunity for the Tories. Carney is an untested leader who appeared condescending and easily annoyed this week by questions he didn't like (interestingly, a trait both leaders share). Already we have seen - through the Conservative party's decision to stand by while right-wing outlets go after Carney's child or share fake images of him next to a sexual predator - that this election won't be a polite affair. Poilievre has spent his entire adult life preparing for this campaign, so we shouldn't be surprised to see everything thrown in to ensure his one shot at becoming prime minister - and that's likely what it is - doesn't end in defeat.

"Ford's MPPs too 'swamped' to help:   Premier expects his team to focus on Ontario, not campaign for Poilievre in the federal election",2025.0,"Premier Doug Ford is reminding Progressive Conservative cabinet ministers and MPPs they will be too ""swamped"" with their day jobs to help Pierre Poilievre in the federal election campaign. Asked at the first ministers' meeting in Ottawa on Friday if he would ""let your MPPs campaign with Mr. Poilievre,"" Ford did not mince words. ""I want to make sure our MPPs are fulfilling our mandate. We are going to be absolutely swamped,"" said the premier, whose Tories were re-elected Feb. 27. ""Let's focus on Ontario. That's our main objective,"" he said when pressed about any role his team would have in the federal election that is expected to begin Sunday. ""I'm not going to help anyone. That's not my job. My job is to keep Ontario moving forward."" His comments came after he and Poilievre disputed a Star account of their call earlier this week when the Conservative leader phoned to ask the premier's ""advice"" on the looming election. ""The report is not accurate,"" said the federal leader, who did not elaborate and ducked a question about why it took him 18 days to congratulate Ford on his landslide re-election. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers, whenever they want to talk, and we talk about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production and reversing the lost Liberal decade of the last nine years,"" he said at a separate event in Ottawa. In French, he insisted he had ""an excellent conversation"" with Ford on Monday. The Star exclusively reported Thursday that Poilievre had belatedly reached out to the premier and the two spoke for about half an hour. ""First of all, it was the first time I ever spoke to him,"" Ford said earlier Friday in Toronto. Poilievre has been federal Conservative leader for two-and-a-half years and Ford has been premier of Ontario that entire time. But the premier said any suggestion Poilievre wanted his assistance in the campaign ""is not accurate at all."" ""He didn't ask me for help so I don't know where they came up with that story. I want to see how each leader is going to protect Ontario,"" said Ford. The premier confirmed what the Star reported about him telling the Tory leader he would be ""staying out"" of the looming campaign. ""I just don't believe in interfering with the federal election,"" he said. ""That's going to be up to the people to decide. I'll work with anyone. I don't care about political stripes, I just don't."" Those privy to the chat said it was at times stilted and awkward because the two have little personal rapport. Ford is working closely with Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals on tackling U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Sources, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, say the federal leader only asked the premier for his ""opinions and advice,"" not for any endorsement in the campaign. It required the diplomatic skills of several veteran Tory operatives with strong ties to both the federal and provincial parties to arrange the phone call. Poilievre's first call to Ford came as support in public-opinion polls for the federal Tories is plunging amid a surge for Carney's Liberals. During the conversation, sources said the premier expressed his displeasure at how some federal Tories deride his three-term Progressive Conservative government as ""not conservative enough."" But Ford assured Poilievre he always casts a ballot for his local Conservative candidate. When reporters asked whether he had ""a better relationship with Mark Carney or Pierre Poilievre,"" he was noncommittal. ""I don't know either one of them, to be very frank."" Pressed him on ""who would you like to get to know better,"" he shrugged. ""Either one. I'll work with anyone.""

Poilievre vows to boost trade apprenticeships,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre announced a plan Friday to boost training and employment for workers in the skilled trades. Speaking at a news conference in Ottawa Friday morning, Poilievre said his plan for ""more boots, less suits"" will expand training halls and provide direct grants and faster access to employment insurance for apprentices in licensed trades. Poilievre said the goal is to deliver higher paycheques to workers and make Canada less reliant on the U.S. economy. The plan would see the federal government offer apprenticeship grants of up to $4,000, fund training halls for skills development for up to 350,000 workers over five years, and work with provinces to harmonize health and safety regulations to allow tradespeople to work anywhere in Canada. ""The people who build the homes are not able to buy them,"" Poilievre said in front of an audience of local construction union members. ""The choice is the next election is very clear. ""Common sense Conservatives will always stand with our employers and our unions right across the country to unleash the great Canadian promise,"" he said.

Poilievre bio to hit shelves early:   A whirlwind news cycle spurred a massive effort to get Ripper: The Making of Pierre Poilievre on shelves earlier than planned,2025.0,"The world was a very different place last May, when historian Mark Bourrie met Biblioasis publisher Dan Wells for coffee in Windsor, Ont., to discuss a book idea. Polling at the time suggested Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was a prime minister in waiting. A book about his rise and the ideas that moulded him sounded like a good proposition. Maybe it could be short, they discussed; maybe they could even get it onto shelves in a year, ahead of the fall 2025 election deadline. Books tend to lag behind the news cycle, however, and this news cycle has been unrelenting – completely reshaping the context for a book examining Poilievre and how his particular brand of populism has been bred and spread. Donald Trump has been reelected U.S. President, forcing the world to reckon with his whims. A Canadian federal election looks imminent, and the Liberals have a new leader in Mark Carney, who appears to be dampening his rival’s electoral chances. Bourrie’s book changed just as rapidly: After just nine months of gestation, its 437 pages are back from the printer and hitting shelves in Ontario this week, nearly a month ahead of its originally planned April release. “It’s an intense subject, the future of Canada – there isn’t anything more important than that, and at a time of revolution, which I think we are in,” he says. Deeply researched non-fiction works usually take much longer to come together. They can often require years of sifting through documents and interviewing key players before a word is written. The expedited timeline of Ripper: The Making of Pierre Poilievre nearly broke Bourrie – a lawyer, journalist and RBC Taylor Prize winner who’s written 15 other books. Bourrie cut back the publicity for his 2024 history book Crosses in the Sky: Jean de Brébeuf and the Destruction of Huronia when he began Ripper, eager to unpack the idea he and Wells had first discussed for a shorter book. But then he filed 105,000 words last fall and wrote an additional 45,000 in the first five weeks of 2025 – after Chrystia Freeland’s resignation from cabinet spurred a leadership race and Trump cast decades of geopolitical stability into disarray. Bourrie quickly found that Poilievre had lived his life on the public record even as a teenager, penning sometimes scathing letters to outlets such as The Calgary Herald. The story was there; he just needed to collate the pieces. In December, when Freeland threw federal politics into disarray, Wells realized that his plan to publish in May or June of this year simply wouldn’t work. His response was to throw everything at it. Every other task he had as head of Biblioasis – grant reports, different manuscripts – fell to the wayside as he worked through Christmas, New Year’s and all of January, sometimes 70 hours a week, reading and editing chapters. Even now, nearly six weeks after putting Ripper to bed, “I’ve never felt further behind,” he says. Wages aside, Wells estimates this was a $100,000 project, putting a massive dent into Biblioasis’s cash flow. But thanks to an unexpectedly quick turnaround from the book’s printer, Friesens, Ripper should be available across the country by early next week. “If this book doesn’t reach as many readers” as initially hoped for when the lead time before an expected election was longer, “we will have to take our lumps,” Wells says. “We would like to sell as many books as we can, but our goal here was to try to put on the public record everything we felt needed to be there” for voters. “In that sense, it’s mission accomplished.” Sutherland House Books last year published a Poilievre biography by Andrew Lawton, who took a sympathetic view of the Conservative leader – and then sought a Conservative riding nomination in Ontario. Bourrie wanted to take a more critical lens to Poilievre’s life. (His book refers to Lawton’s treatment of the politician as “soft-gloved.”) Bourrie argues that the Conservative leader’s worldview was already deeply established by the time he entered university. “I looked at what he said then and what he says now. There isn’t a lot of development intellectually or politically. The myths and slogans of his teenage years are still his political foundation.” The author says he “bent over backwards to be fair” to Poilievre, but felt a moral obligation to contextualize the leader on the record. “I don’t think that Pierre Poilievre is anywhere near the extreme threat of a Donald Trump or a Viktor Orban.” Ripper is one of several Canadian political books whose publication plans have recently been thrown astray. House of Anansi rushed to get Catherine Tsalikis’s Freeland biography onto shelves in December after the politician’s cabinet resignation, and McClelland and Stewart/Signal has delayed publication of Carney’s new book The Hinge, initially scheduled for a May 13 release.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",Josh O’Kane,The Globe and Mail,"Mar 22, 2025",Leadership; Scandals; Book reviews; Biographies,Nom: Biblioasis; NAICS: 513130,2025-03-22,The Globe and Mail
"Call was first time speaking with Poilievre, denies he was asked for help: Ford",2025.0,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his phone call Monday with federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was the first time the two of them had ever spoken, but both men said Friday that the call did not involve a request for help with Mr. Poilievre’s election campaign. A Toronto Star report said Mr. Poilievre had asked for Mr. Ford’s help with the upcoming election and that the Premier had turned him down, but the two leaders said that was not correct. “First of all, it was the first I ever, ever spoke to him, and I guess what was reported is not accurate at all. He didn’t ask my for help,” Mr. Ford said at a photo opportunity in Toronto Friday morning. The Premier, whose Progressive Conservative Party was recently re-elected to a third consecutive majority government, repeated his policy of not endorsing a party at the federal level. “I just don’t believe in interfering in the federal election. That’s going to be up to the people to decide. I’ll work with anyone,” he said. Mr. Ford has led his party since 2018. Mr. Poilievre has been the Conservative Leader since 2022 and has represented an Ontario riding in Parliament since 2004. The Ontario PC caucus includes several individuals who were previously federal Conservative MPs. But even with many ties between the two parties, public shows of support between the Ontario and federal Tories are rare. Neither Mr. Ford nor Mr. Poilievre have ever clearly explained why. Mr. Poilievre was asked Friday whether he had asked Mr. Ford for his support and why the two men rarely say positive things about each other. He too said the Star report “was not accurate” – that he and Mr. Ford discussed creating jobs, supporting Ring of Fire resource projects in Northern Ontario, cutting taxes “and reversing the lost Liberal decade of the last nine years.” A source familiar with the phone call said Mr. Poilievre did not ask the Premier for anything and described the tone of the conversation as friendly and positive. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the source because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the conversation. The source said Mr. Poilievre congratulated Mr. Ford on his Feb. 27 election victory, but the purpose of the call was not explicitly to congratulate the Premier. The conversation focused on cooperation and partnership, the source said, including protecting Ontario and Canada from the threat of U.S. tariffs. The source said the federal Conservative Leader was looking for advice, and Mr. Ford was receptive. Mr. Poilievre has not spoken publicly about Mr. Ford’s win, although the source said the leaders’ respective teams have talked. Mr. Poilievre also did not congratulate Mr. Ford on social media. The Premier has spoken glowingly about new Prime Minister Mark Carney, as well as former leadership candidate Chrystia Freeland, who had coffee with Mr. Ford and attended the Premier’s swearing-in ceremony in Toronto earlier this week. On Friday Mr. Poilievre spoke with reporters in Ottawa at a campaign-style event at a training facility run by a local of the Labourers’ International Union of North America (LiUNA!), where he said a Conservative government would bring in a package of policies aimed at helping Canadians receive training in the skilled trades. During his appearance, Mr. Poilievre also indicated he hopes to frame the key question for voters as one that takes into account the Liberal record under former prime minister Justin Trudeau. “The question in the next election will be: Can Canada afford a fourth term of the Liberals, led by Mark Carney, who, working with Trudeau, made Canada weaker and poorer and is too weak and conflicted to stand up to Donald Trump? Or do you think it’s time for a real change with a Conservative government that will stand up to Trump from a position of strength, unleash growth, bring home jobs, axe taxes, build homes, secure our border, rebuild our military and put Canada first?” he said.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Curry, Bill; Stone, Laura",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 22, 2025",Canada-US relations; Political campaigns; Political leadership; Prime ministers,,2025-03-22,The Globe and Mail
"THE ELECTION HAS BECOME A HORSE RACE:   How do we explain the swing in public opinion? It’s clear that the Conservatives’ lead in the polls was not an embrace of Poilievre or his party’s policies. Rather, it was a repudiation of Trudeau and his government",2025.0,"Nik Nanos is the chief data scientist at Nanos Research, research adjunct professor at the Norman Paterson School for International Affairs at Carleton University, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington and the official pollster for The Globe and Mail and CTV News. By the end of 2024, the next Canadian federal election was shaping up to be a car crash for the Liberals. The party, which has been in power since 2015, seemed destined for political exile. Despite weathering U.S. President Donald Trump’s first term, the pandemic, the SNC-Lavalin affair and the WE charity controversy – or probably because of these things – Justin Trudeau had become a polarizing figure, while Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was probably measuring the drapes in the Prime Minister’s Office. With a massive 27-point Conservative advantage at the beginning of 2025, the expected showdown between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Poilievre was shaping up to be a disaster for a tired Liberal government that had hit its best-before date. Not often does one see massive, short-term swings in a non-election campaign period. But Mr. Trudeau’s resignation, Mr. Trump’s musings on tariffs and the subsequent election of Mark Carney as Liberal Leader, has resulted in a significant change. The upcoming federal election is going to be a horse race. How do we explain the swing in public opinion? It’s clear that the Conservatives’ lead in the polls was not an embrace of Mr. Poilievre or his party’s policies. Rather, it was a repudiation of Mr. Trudeau and his government. Apart from the race narrowing, two other data trends have redrawn the battle lines for the next election. At the end of 2024, 54 per cent of Canadians said they would consider voting Conservative. That has since declined to 43 per cent. In late December, only 35 per cent of Canadians said they would consider voting Liberal. That has now increased to 50 per cent, surpassing the Conservatives. The anger once directed at Mr. Trudeau has shifted toward Mr. Trump. When we asked an openended question regarding today’s top national issue of concern, Mr. Trump received the most responses – concern about Mr. Trump and U.S.-Canada relations received 27 per cent of the responses, up 12 points in four weeks. When asked what will influence their vote, a recent CTV News/Nanos survey suggests two of three Canadians will be swayed by who they think can best deal with Mr. Trump (36 per cent). Mr. Trump has triggered an unusual mix of emotions in Canadians. A new Globe and Mail/Nanos survey shows that Canadians are experiencing anxiousness for the future (67 per cent), are avoiding the internet/news (31 per cent) and feeling financial stress (23 per cent) as a result of the current diplomatic tensions with the United States. The same survey shows that our self-image as a nation has improved (30 per cent) or somewhat improved (25 per cent) over the past year, while our view of the U.S. has fallen off a cliff. Almost nine in 10 Canadians say their opinion of the United States has worsened (78 per cent) or somewhat worsened (10 per cent) compared to a year ago. Add to the emotion the dampening consumer confidence which started literally the day after Mr. Trump won the presidency. In advance of November’s U.S. election, Canadian consumer confidence, as measured by the Bloomberg/Nanos Canadian Consumer Confidence Index, was in positive territory. That’s no longer the case, and about six in 10 Canadians think the economy will further weaken over the next year. The combination of Mr. Trump’s assault on the Canadian economy and Mr. Trudeau’s resignation in short succession have been game changers, refocusing voters on the future instead of the past. If the next election was about the past 10 years, Mr. Poilievre would be riding high and crushing the Liberals. Right now, the next election is shaping up to be one about the future and who could best navigate the changing world order. Buckle up, because the federal election is going to be a wild ride. When the numbers swing quickly in one direction, they can swing again and yet again. Today’s trend line, which is favouring the Liberals, can change – and change quickly. We can also throw preconceptions about party loyalty or anger at the incumbents out the door. Expect voters to size up the choices not based on their track record or snappy sound bites but on a cold, hard assessment as to who can best deal with Mr. Trump and who can help Canada best navigate a changing world economy. Speaking of Mr. Trump, he is both an accelerant and enabler of instability. Expect the party leaders to see both their political rivals and Mr. Trump as their opponents. The prolific and almost daily commentary from the White House on Canada will undermine the ability of Canadian political leaders to shape the narrative of the coming campaign. The ironic twist is that for a nation fixated on possible foreign interference in our democracy, the 2025 election could very well showcase another country’s open and transparent influence on the Canadian election. Canadians face some very clear yet imperfect choices. On the one hand, Mr. Poilievre is a battle-hardened and disciplined politician. On the other hand, Mr. Carney can claim experience navigating things like the Great Recession and Brexit, but remains politically untested. A competitive election is good for democracy and good for those who aspire to lead our nation. This campaign will likely be as important as the epic 1988 free-trade election, when Canadians laid the track for the country’s future. The outcome is uncertain, though one thing isn’t: Everyone’s vote will matter this time.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,The Globe and Mail,"Mar 22, 2025",Canada-US relations; Conservatism; Political campaigns; Canadians; Consumer Confidence Index; Voters,,2025-03-22,The Globe and Mail
"Ford, Poilievre push back on report the premier rebuffed federal leader",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Both Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Ontario Premier Doug Ford are clapping back at a report suggesting the federal leader asked the premier for help on the upcoming election campaign, but was rebuffed. ""The report is not accurate,"" Poilievre told reporters during a press conference at a union local in suburban Ottawa Friday morning. In French, he added that he had an ""excellent"" conversation with Ford. ""I did speak to the premier, as I do with all premiers when they want to talk, and we talked about bringing home jobs to Canada, supporting the Ring of Fire, cutting taxes, unleashing our production, and reversing the lost Liberal decade,"" he added, reprising many of his recent policy announcements. A Toronto Star report on Thursday cited unnamed sources who said the Conservative leader called Ford on Monday and asked him for advice on the upcoming federal election. According to the Star, Ford declined to provide any guidance or help and told Poilievre he was focused on leading Ontario and would stay out of the federal race. The Star story says there has been no love lost between the two camps for years, with many in Poilievre's entourage believing Ford's Progressive Conservatives don't govern enough from the right. Also Friday morning in Toronto, Ford went even further than Poilievre, and said that the federal leader did not ask him for help or support and that the Toronto Star story was wrong. ""It was the first time I ever spoke to him. I guess what was reported was not accurate at all,"" Ford said. ""He didn't ask me for help ... so I don't know where they came up with that story."" But at a second press conference in Ottawa, Ford confirmed Poilievre asked him for advice during the call, which the premier gave him. ""He didn't ask me for support, he didn't ask me to endorse him, he asked for advice and like I've told everyone, tell the people of Canada how you're going to protect them,"" Ford said. ""I gave the same advice to Prime Minister Carney,"" he added. ""Do we need the support overall of the federal government? Yes, but get out of our way and let us start moving."" Ford also said he wouldn't be helping any federal party during the election. Ivison: Why Poilievre needs to pivot from stoking anger to harnessing hope What is a blind trust and why is everyone asking Mark Carney about his? Both leaders dodged questions about the revelations that the tone of the call was ""stilted and awkward,"" and that Ford's entourage was annoyed Poilievre did not congratulate the premier for his election win on Feb. 27. ""I want to see how each leader is going to protect Ontario. Are they going to get the Ring of Fire moving forward. Are they going to get out of the way and make sure we get into the critical minerals?"" Ford told reporters. ""Times have changed now. We're in an economic war with the largest country in the world and we have to get to those critical minerals as quickly as possible,"" he added. During his Friday press conference, Poilievre announced a Conservative government would maintain a $4,000 apprenticeship grant that helps apprentices cover the cost of training in their trade. He also promised funding for union training halls to help cover the cost of equipment and programs. A third promise was to create a ""special rapid class"" of Employment Insurance (EI) that would accelerate applications for tradespeople who step away from their work for additional training. ""Right now, they have to wait weeks on end without any money coming in as they're training up, and that puts them in a tough spot paying the rent,"" Poilievre said. The Conservative leader also took a swipe at Prime Minister Mark Carney, accusing him of being a ""union buster"" because of the actions of certain divisions of Brookfield Asset management while he chaired the company's board of directors. ""Mark Carney will never stand up for the working people. He will only stand up for the millionaire and billionaire global elites. That is all he has ever done,"" Poilievre charged. The prime minister has not yet responded to Poilievre's ""union buster"" insult, but is expected to address the media after he meets with the premiers Friday night in Ottawa. Carney is expected to visit Governor General Mary Simon on Sunday to request she dissolve Parliament and launch a snap federal election.

Ivison: Why Poilievre needs to pivot from stoking anger to harnessing hope,2025.0,"This week, John Ivison is joined by regular panelists Ian Brodie, politics professor at the University of Calgary and a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Eugene Lang, an assistant professor at Queen's University and an ex-chief of staff to two Liberal defence ministers. With an election call pending this weekend, Ivison asked how the two view the upcoming campaign. Brodie said the dominant emotion driving the electorate before Donald Trump's inauguration in January was anger. ""You know, 'I can't find a place to live. I can't find a place to rent. Why are these eggs so expensive? Why is gas so high in Western Canada? Why is the federal government trying to stop me from getting a job?' ""The Conservatives up until that point had sort of perfected a campaign based on harnessing and redirecting that anger,"" he said. ""I think since (Trump's) 51st state comments have ramped up, the dominant emotional mood has shifted from anger to fear. That change has left the two parties scrambling for a different type of campaign effort."" The difficulty for the Conservatives is to pivot to a campaign based on hope. ""The issue is going to be about Trump. And if you don't have an answer to the Trump question, the campaign starts behind,"" he said. Lang said he is shocked that the Liberal Party brand is still relatively healthy, despite the plunge in the polls under Justin Trudeau. ""That's surprising to me. I thought (Trudeau's) 10 years in office had done some irreparable damage to it, but it looks like the brand is still pretty strong,"" he said. ""Interestingly to me, what we're seeing in the polling and anecdotally is a rise in what I'm going to call Canadian nationalism in response to the fear that Ian articulated. And it seems (people) think the Liberal Party is more attuned with Canadian nationalism than the other parties."" Brodie said the Conservatives are still testing what is going to work to increase negative perceptions of the new Liberal leader. ""The probing of what's going to work, and what's not going to work, is still going on. So, there's been a bit of 'Carbon-Tax Carney' and 'Sneaky Carney' on his ethics disclosures and potential conflicts of interest. And certainly here in Western Canada, I would say the issue of the federal attack on the oil and gas industry is still a salient issue."" The Liberals have accused the Conservative leader of focusing on slogans, not solutions, to the problems facing Canada. Brodie said there has been a lack of follow up to Poilievre's ""Canada First"" speech last month in Ottawa, which hinted at a broader agenda of growth and harnessing the energy of the economy and individual Canadians. But he noted that this week, Poilievre has focused on developing the Ring of Fire in Northern Ontario, after 25 years of talking about it. ""I think that's the forward-leaning message to carry through the beginning of that campaign because that is the 'hope' piece to fight the 'fear' piece - a 'can do' cultural attitude rather than 'Canada can't'. I think that's a promising development,"" he said. Lang pointed out that, while the daily stresses about affordability and housing are still there, they are unlikely to be the dominant concern at a time when people are awakening to the fact that the very existence of the country might be on the line. ""It could be an election that's just about how much confidence do we have in these two parties, and in these two leaders to navigate through this situation, recognizing that there's no immediate policy solutions for it,"" he said. ""One thing Mr. Carney has going for him is that he exudes substance. No one's ever going to challenge him as not having substance and not having ideas. Actually, some of the ideas that they've trotted out so far are not that impressive to me. But it doesn't really matter. He's got the 'substance' market cornered. Mr. Poilievre has more of a challenge there, to get into the substance market in a big way. And he's probably going to have to lean into policy more than I thought. I remember saying on your show back in December when we spoke, I didn't think he even needed an election platform to run on. I've completely changed my mind on that now. I think policy is going to be very central to his campaign."" Brodie said that Carney has been heavy on substance, but largely as a reaction to the last two and a half years of Poilievre's leadership, attacking loose monetary policy as a cause of inflation; focusing on the housing crisis; and, campaigning on an end to the consumer carbon tax. ""Carney had in a sense to catch up with Poilievre. Look, left his own devices. I think we all know Mark. He would not on his own, absent Poilievre, have said: 'You know what I should do? I should campaign on repealing the carbon tax'. He wrote a whole bloody book about why the carbon tax should be four times higher than it is. He did not say: 'Hey, my life's ambition is to repeal carbon pricing in Canada',"" he said. ""As long as Poilievre keeps pushing him on these sorts of policy issues, I think Carney's going to be having to respond and play catch up."" Brodie and Lang agreed that both leaders are being judged on their perceived ability to respond to Trump's aggression. Lang said that the purpose of Carney's trip to Europe this week was to make the new Liberal leader appear prime ministerial - and in his opinion, it worked. ""At a certain point in an election campaign, the leaders have to appear to be prime ministerial. Mark Carney looks and feels and smells prime ministerial, and that trip reinforced that, even if you don't particularly like him or his policies,"" he said. ""I think the challenge for Mr. Poilievre in the next 40 days is to make this transition from looking like a very effective leader of the Opposition to looking like a plausible prime minister."" Brodie agreed that Poilievre has been playing the role of Opposition leader. ""The job of the Opposition leader is to oppose,"" he said. ""I think we all have to concede that he was extremely good at that and did a large part of destroying Mr. Trudeau's political career and laying the groundwork for Ms. (Chrystia) Freeland's exit from the cabinet (last December). The question is, can he take that skill, that fortitude and that discipline and switch to make a case for moving to the government side?"" Lang said at a press conference on Thursday, Poilievre seemed to change his tone and comportment. ""He seemed a lot more relaxed, friendlier, smiling, respectful of the questions that he got, not dismissive. And I think if he continues that, that's the right approach for him - to gradually look more, let's just call it grown up and mature and prime ministerial, which I believe has been a weakness of his."" He said, for Carney, the danger is being too aloof. ""He can't appear to be dismissive of people that are asking him questions that he might not like, to want to answer. When you're in an election campaign, everything's fair game. Your integrity will be challenged whether there's any evidence to challenge it or not. That is politics in this day and age. And you can't take it personally. If he takes these things personally, he's going to get into trouble in my view. So he's got to find an equilibrium of his own that remains, that keeps this prime ministerial aura around him, which I think he has, and man of substance, without appearing out of touch, distant, aloof, and dismissive.""

Poilievre takes Trump's jab as a compliment,2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump said it is ""easier to deal"" with a Liberal than a Conservative, and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is taking it as a compliment. ""You know what? On that point, it's true,"" said Poilievre, speaking to reporters at a press conference hosted by a construction company in Sudbury, Ont., on Wednesday. ""I'm a strong leader. I'm a tough guy to deal with. I'm firm in my convictions and I'll always put Canada first,"" he added, referring to his latest slogan, ""Canada First,"" which he has been repeating since the start of the U.S. trade war with Canada. Liberal ministers laughed off Trump's comments and downplayed Poilievre's. ""I couldn't care less what Donald Trump wants or thinks in the context of Canadian politics,"" said Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson before a cabinet meeting on Canada-U.S. relations. ""If that's the biggest victory that Mr. Poilievre thinks that he can get, fair enough."" Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was surprised to hear the Conservatives refer to themselves as ""tough."" ""Really? I don't know. I've seen them for 10 years, they don't look very tough to me."" Poilievre said it is no wonder that Trump would rather have to deal with a Liberal prime minister instead of him, pointing to how, in his view, Liberals have been blocking energy resource projects, hiking taxes and driving investments to the U.S. in the last nine years. He also pointed to Brookfield Asset Management's decision to move its head office from Toronto to New York, which happened last year during Prime Minister Mark Carney's tenure as chair. The decision happened around the same time as Trump was re-elected for his second term in the U.S. He threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. Pointing to the workers behind him, Poilievre said: ""While these people here were worried about losing their jobs, Mark Carney was busy moving jobs to Trump's hometown. ""That's exactly the kind of weak, compromised, conflicted leadership that Donald Trump wants, and it's why he endorsed Mark Carney yesterday."" Trump did not explicitly endorse Carney during his interview with Fox News. In the interview, which aired Tuesday e vening , Trump was asked about the changing polls in Canada that show that Carney's Liberals could form the next government after the next election, overtaking Poilievre's Conservative party, which had enjoyed a comfortable lead for the past 18 months. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,"" Trump said. The U.S. president went on to take a shot at Poilievre, saying that ""the Conservative that's running is, stupidly, no friend of mine."" ""I don't know, but he said negative things. So, when he says negative things, I couldn't care less,"" he said. It is not the first time that Trump has criticized the leader of Canada's Conservatives. In an inter view with the Spectator published in February, Trump said that Poilievre's ""biggest problem is he's not a MAGA guy,"" referring to his ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. ""I mean, he's really not, he's not a Trump guy at all,"" Trump added. ""Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA. I am for Canada First. Always,"" Poilievre wrote on X in response. In that same interview, Trump seemingly warned Conservatives, like Poilievre, not to puff their chest so fast. ""They all make that mistake,"" he said. ""They think they're going to be the tough guy and they're going to knock out Trump, and they end up getting the hell beat out of 'em.""

"Honouring tradition, Canada Post unveils stamp of Brian Mulroney",2025.0,"Canada Post unveiled a new stamp on Thursday in tribute to Brian Mulroney, Canada's 18th prime minister. The release continues Canada Post's long-standing tradition of commemorating former Canadian prime ministers. Born in Baie-Comeau, on Quebec's lower north shore, Mulroney served as prime minister from 1984 to 1993. He died on Feb. 29, 2024, at the age of 84 The stamp features a photograph of Mulroney smiling and it was designed by the Montreal-based firm Paprika. Canada Post said it has issued 120,000 booklets, each containing 10 permanent stamps, along with 7,000 official first-day covers. Thursday's unveiling ceremony took place at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and featured an intimate gathering of family and close friends invited by the Mulroney family. Attendees heard remarks from Canada Post executives and Mulroney's son, Ben. ""It's his birthday today, so to be able to spend the day with my family and celebrate Dad this way is fitting and wonderful,"" Ben told The Gazette after the unveiling. When choosing the image of Mulroney for the stamp, he explained that the family had gone ""back and forth on a number of pictures,"" but the one chosen ""was the one we kept coming back to."" ""It's the cover of his memoir, and it's our favourite picture of him because it was a time in his life when he was optimistic and purely happy,"" he said. Asked what his father would make of today's political climate, Ben responded: ""I'm reticent to speak for him, but there's a lot of hyperbole out there. I remember asking him about it during Trump 1.0, when people were saying Donald Trump was going to destroy America and democracy. He told me: 'I'm far more bullish on the American republic than on any one person's attempts to destroy it.' ""And so I think he would say today: 'I'm far more bullish on Canada than on any one person's attempt to annex it.'""",The Montreal Gazette (Online); Montreal,Montreal,,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 21, 2025",Prime ministers,,2025-03-21,Montreal Gazette
Ford says Monday call was his first time speaking with Poilievre:   Ontario Premier and Conservative Leader deny media report that Poilievre sought Ford’s help with coming election campaign,2025.0,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his phone call this week with federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was the first time the two of them had ever spoken, but both men said Friday the call did not involve a request for Mr. Ford to help out Mr. Poilievre’s campaign. The two party leaders spoke Monday. On Friday, they both said a Toronto Star report that Mr. Poilievre had asked for campaign help was not correct. ""First of all, it was the first I ever, ever spoke to him, and I guess what was reported is not accurate at all. He didn’t ask my for help,"" Mr. Ford said at a photo opportunity in Toronto Friday morning. Mr. Ford, whose Progressive Conservative Party was recently re-elected to a third consecutive majority government in the province, repeated his plan not to endorse a party at the federal level. ""I just don’t believe in interfering in the federal election. That’s going to be up to the people to decide. I’ll work with anyone,"" he said. Mr. Ford has led Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Party since 2018. Mr. Poilievre has been the Conservative Leader since 2022 and has represented an Ontario riding in Parliament since 2004. Mr. Ford’s Ontario caucus includes several individuals who were previously federal Conservative MPs. Even with many ties between the two parties, public shows of support between the Ontario and federal Tories are rare. Neither Mr. Ford nor Mr. Poilievre have ever clearly explained why. Mr. Poilievre was asked Friday whether he had asked Mr. Ford for his support and why the two men rarely say positive things about each other. Mr. Poilievre said the report ""was not accurate."" He said he and Mr. Ford discussed creating jobs, supporting the Ring of Fire resource projects in Northern Ontario, cutting taxes ""and reversing the lost Liberal decade of the last nine years."" Mr. Poilievre spoke with reporters in Ottawa at a campaign-style event at a training facility run by a local of the Labourers’ International Union of North America (LiUNA!), where he said a Conservative government would bring in a package of policies aimed at helping Canadians receive training in the skilled trades. Mr. Poilievre was also asked about Alberta Premier Danielle Smith’s statement Thursday, in which she said she provided Prime Minister Mark Carney with a specific list of demands that the next prime minister, whoever it is, must address within the first six months of their term ""to avoid an unprecedented national unity crisis."" The list included lifting several specific federal restrictions on oil and gas production and ending the prohibition on single use plastics, such as straws. Mr. Carney, who is expected to call a federal election campaign that will begin Sunday, is hosting his first meeting with provincial and territorial premiers Friday. He said he wants to speed up approvals of pipelines and energy corridors. The focus of the first ministers meeting is to discuss Canada’s responses to the tariffs that are being threatened and imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Mr. Poilievre has long advocated for many of the proposals on Ms. Smith’s list. He described the Alberta Premier’s demands as ""very reasonable"" when asked Friday. ""She was making clear that Mark Carney is using weasel words. He’s pretending that he suddenly, 30 days before an election, changed his entire radical, Net Zero, keep-it-in-the-ground ideology,"" said Mr. Poilievre. ""Mr. Carney, I can’t even believe he would have the audacity to show up in Edmonton."" During his appearance, Mr. Poilievre also indicated he hopes to frame the key question for voters as one that takes into account the Liberal record under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""The question in the next election will be, can Canada afford a fourth term of the Liberals, led by Mark Carney, who working with Trudeau, made Canada weaker and poorer, and is too weak and conflicted to stand up to Donald Trump? Or do you think it’s time for a real change with a Conservative government that will stand up to Trump from a position of strength, unleash growth, bring home jobs, axe taxes, build homes, secure our border, rebuild our military and put Canada first?"" he said. - With reports from Laura Stone in Toronto Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: Ford says Monday call was his first time speaking with Poilievre",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 21, 2025",Canada-US relations; Political campaigns; Prime ministers; Political parties,,2025-03-21,The Globe and Mail
Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called Doug Ford to ask him ...[Derived Headline ],2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called Doug Ford to ask him for ""advice"" on the upcoming federal election campaign, but the premier told him he's governing Ontario and staying out of it, the Star has learned. Federal and provincial Tory sources said Poilievre phoned the premier on Monday to belatedly offer his congratulations for the Progressive Conservatives' Feb. 27 re-election. The conversation - 18 days after Ford's victory, which then-prime minister Justin Trudeau had saluted moments after it was official - lasted almost half an hour. But those privy to the chat said it was at times stilted and awkward because the two leaders have little personal rapport. Sources say Poilievre asked Ford for his ""opinions and advice"" about winning Ontario, not for any endorsement in an election campaign that will officially begin Sunday. Far from a rapprochement, sources said, it was an opportunity for Ford to flex as the most powerful Tory politician in Canada after his high-profile stance against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. It was also a chance for him to express his displeasure to Poilievre at how some federal Tories disparage his three-term government as ""not conservative enough."" Several veteran Tories with strong ties to both the federal and provincial parties helped to arrange the phone call. One operative confided that Poilievre's refusal to send out a congratulatory social media post to Ford on his election win last month was churlish. ""It was ridiculous and childish. Conservatives should be happy when Conservatives win,"" said one insider, speaking confidentially in order to recount internal discussions. Ford - a keen student of polls who pores over public-opinion research - was mindful Poilievre was calling him a time when support for the federal Tories is dropping as new Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals surge. While the premier assured the Tory leader he always casts a ballot for his local Conservative candidate in elections, that would be the extent of his involvement in this campaign. ""I'm staying out of it,"" said Ford, repeating what he has said publicly in recent days. Emphasizing he ""will work with anyone"" in power in Ottawa, the premier patiently explained to Poilievre that, in Canada's trade war with Trump, political stripes must be set aside. That's why Ford hosted Carney for breakfast last week at Wally's Grill in Etobicoke, where they discussed strategy for dealing with Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods. But the federal Tories were stung when, the morning after the call with Poilievre, the premier was having coffee at his home with Liberal Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland. Freeland, who posted selfies with Ford on Instagram, was also a special guest at Wednesday's provincial cabinet swearing-in ceremony at the Royal Ontario Museum. ""It's no secret I have a great relationship with Chrystia Freeland. I have a great relationship with (Intergovernmental Affairs Minister) Dominic LeBlanc,"" Ford said Tuesday. When reporters asked whether he had ""a better relationship with Mark Carney or Pierre Poilievre,"" Ford was noncommittal. ""I don't know either one of them, to be very frank,"" the premier said. When a reporter pressed him on ""who would you like to get to know better,"" he replied with a shrug, ""Either one. I'll work with anyone."" But his strained relations with the federal Tories long predate Poilievre's tenure. In 2019, when Ford's popularity in public-opinion polls was plunging, federal Tory leader Andrew Scheer pointedly dissociated himself from the provincial party. Scheer campaigned just 250 metres from Ford's Etobicoke home with Alberta premier Jason Kenney - but not only was the Ontario premier not invited to the event, his name was never mentioned from the podium. Last March, Ford was furious when Jamil Jivani, a Poilievre MP, attacked provincial minister Stephen Lecce. Jivani, who had worked as the premier's community opportunities advocate from 2019 until 2022, railed against ""the liberal elites who run the Ontario Ministry of Education in this province."" Ford reminded the MP that ""no one even knew who he was"" before he worked for him and that he should stick to his own lane. ""To be very frank - and go to root cause - he wouldn't even be where he is if I didn't give him that opportunity, "" the premier said. The Durham MP is among many in Poilievre's orbit who used to work for Ford - his most trusted advisers Jenni Byrne, Michael Wilson and Ian Todd all served at Queen's Park and the federal party's executive director, Mike Crase, previously ran the provincial PC party. Despite all those connections, staff at the two parties are actively discouraged from helping one another during byelection and election campaigns. In the recent Ontario campaign, federal Tories wouldn't aid their provincial cousins on the hustings except in Eglinton-Lawrence, where PC Michelle Cooper beat Liberal Vince Gasparro by 167 votes. On Thursday, before a meeting with Quebec Premier François Legault, Poilievre emphasized that he's ""not out seeking provincial premiers' endorsements."" That was three days after Ford indicated he wouldn't be giving one to any federal leader.

"Are Poilievre s investments in a blind trust Mark Carney ...[Derived Headline ] :   Mark Carney risks getting 'hammered' for prickly response to questions about his finances, experts say, March 18 management system? March 19 Trump says Liberal government would be easier, says Poilievre is 'no friend of mine, March 19 Turkish police arrest Istanbul mayor, a key Erdogan rival, as government crackdown escalates, March 19 Toronto tree has nearly 200 Google reviews. How 'Rodney' became an international tourist attraction, March 18",2025.0,"Are Poilievre's investments in a blind trust? Mark Carney risks getting 'hammered' for prickly response to questions about his finances, experts say, March 18 Mark Carney said he had placed his investments in a blind trust upon being elected Liberal leader. He was not sworn in as prime minister until five days later. He is still not an MP, so he is not subject to Parliament's Conflict of Interest Code. His placing assets in a blind trust was completely voluntarily. Pierre Poilievre raised this issue during Carney's campaign for leadership. Poilievre was elected Conservative leader in 2022. Until recently, Poilievre was on the verge of winning a landslide election and becoming Canada's next prime minister. If this is such an important issue for him, why haven't his investments been in a blind trust since 2022? And why aren't they in one right now? As Justin Trudeau says ""Make that make sense."" Clyde McDonald, Bracebridge, Ont. Canada's supply management system works Trump is targeting Canada's dairy industry. Is it time to rethink our decades-old supply management system? March 19 The article doesn't mention that the U.S. heavily subsidizes its dairy industry through both direct and indirect subsidies. A 2018 study by Grey, Clark, Shih and Associates found that U.S. subsidies to the dairy industry ($22.2 billion U.S. in 2015) amounted to a whopping 73 per cent of U.S. dairy farmers' market returns. In Canada, our supply management system has resulted in there being no need to subsidize dairy farmers - well, except to compensate for the adverse effects of ""free trade"" deals with the U.S. and the EU that cut into the supply management system without accounting for U.S. and EU subsidies. The article points out that the biggest financial barrier to entry into the dairy industry is the high cost of quota. Quota is bought and sold on a ""free market"" basis, so it appears that it is not supply management that is a problem, it is the ""free market"" part of it that was allowed to exist that is driving up costs to enter. Since the U.S. president is determined to undermine Canadian sovereignty, it would be foolish for Canada to give up a very important part of our food sovereignty by moving away from our highly successful supply management system. Because we have a supply management system in place, Trump's threatened tariffs will have minimal impact on our continued supply of safe, hormone free, milk.

Karin Brothers, Toronto Far-right leaders protect their own Trump says Liberal government would be easier, says Poilievre is 'no friend of mine, March 19 U.S. President Donald Trump tells us that he does not like Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Do you believe him? The MAGA team knows that a Trump endorsement would be a political death wish for Poilievre. But do not be fooled. Trump wants Poilievre to be Canada's next prime minister and is using reverse psychology on Canadians in an attempt to achieve it. Trump claims that he would rather deal with a Liberal than a Conservative in Ottawa. This is the same tactic Russian President Vladimir Putin used when he said that he preferred Kamala Harris as president, while actually backing Trump. Trump knows that Poilievre would be more inclined to sacrifice Canada's public health-care system and to throw our dairy farmers under the bus in any future trade agreement. Venus Pippins, Toronto Benefits barely cover a senior's living costs I have written to both Premier Doug Ford and former prime minister Justin Trudeau concerning a truly important issue to seniors and for persons with disabilities who rely on monthly CPP and CPP disability benefits but have received nothing as a response thus far. The maximum monthly benefits for CPP is $1,433 and the CPP disability benefit pays $1,673.24. These benefits barely cover a person's monthly costs of living. In fact, in most cases, it barely covers rent let alone, food, personal grooming products, household cleaning products, medication, transportation, etc. Canadians have repeatedly been told by both Liberals and Conservatives governments that turning these monthly benefits into a livable income is a priority, but it NEVER happens. Many of us have to turn to food banks and other charitable organizations just to make it through another month. The minimum wage in this country is $17.20/hour yet at the maximum CPP disability benefits translates to $9.66/hour. If CPP and CPP disability benefits were equivalent to minimum wage, the monthly benefits would be $2981.33, an increase that would ensure people can actually live without fear of having to ration food, medications etc. This is a sickening shame that needs to be addressed immediately by all parties. We're fed up and tired of excuses.

Poilievre wants to revive LNG project,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre visited Quebec’s Saguenay region Thursday to promote the revival of a $14-billion liquefied natural gas project, pledging to create “shovel-ready zones” for resource projects across the country. The province refused to authorize GNL Québec Inc.’s proposed liquefaction facility and export terminal in 2021, and Ottawa followed suit in 2022, with both governments citing environmental and other concerns. The project would have involved transporting natural gas, likely from Western Canada, using an existing pipeline network. A new, 650-kilometre pipeline would be needed to connect the network to the proposed plant. The Quebec government said last month that it may be open to reviving the project as a way of diversifying Canada’s export markets in light of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports. The federal election campaign is not expected to officially start until Sunday, but Mr. Poilievre is touring the country this week and holding campaign-style events. He made a similar announcement Wednesday during a stop in Sudbury, where he pledged to speed up permitting for mining projects in Northern Ontario’s Ring of Fire region. The Ring of Fire project has faced several delays related to environmental approvals and consultations with Indigenous communities. While some First Nations are open to development in the area, others are strongly opposed. The Quebec government had rejected the LNG project on the grounds that it did not have social acceptability in the province. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had been interested in investing $4billion in the project but backed away in 2020, citing Canada’s “current political context.” The developer, Ruby River Capital LLC, a partnership of two U.S. private equity funds, responded to the rejection by initiating a NAFTA claim against the Canadian government, seeking to recoup US$120-million in sunk costs and another US$20-billion in lost profits, as damages. Mr. Poilievre said Mr. Trump’s policies have altered what Quebeckers view as acceptable. “The status quo does not have social acceptability,” Mr. Poilievre said in French. He said Northern Quebec can liquefy natural gas with fewer emissions because of its hydroelectric resources and colder climate. “I am convinced that we can secure social acceptability,” he said. A Conservative government would take the steps to have the project preapproved, he said, “so that we can ship Western Canadian LNG through a pipeline to this region, liquefy it here, using the great workers of the Saguenay to get it done.” The Montreal Economic Institute think tank issued a report Thursday that estimates the 10.5million-tonne-a-year project would have diverted nearly 19.4 per cent of Canadian gas exports away from the United States to overseas markets had it been operating in 2024, representing “value” of $1.7-billion. Officials from the U.S. backers of the project, Freestone International LLC and Breyer Capital LLC, did not immediately respond to queries about whether they would consider reviving the project. Speaking more broadly, Mr. Poilievre said he would create “Canada shovel-ready zones” throughout the country to prepermit projects such as power stations, LNG plants and pipelines. He said this can be done with “rigorous” environmental studies, while working with other levels of government and consulting First Nations. “The goal will be to prepublish permits online so that everybody knows, and next time, investors don’t have to fear that they’re going to waste so much money on lawyers and fees all to get to nothing,” he said. Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged during the recent Liberal Party leadership race that he would expand and modernize Canada’s energy infrastructure to diversify trade. His campaign mentioned both clean energy and fossil fuels, but he did not specify the level of support for each sector. The Carney leadership campaign platform did include a pledge to designate “critical infrastructure corridors,” which sounds similar to Mr. Poilievre’s Thursday pledge of “shovel-ready zones.” Mr. Carney’s infrastructure corridors pledge was described as a plan to “allow for rapid designation of corridors preapproved for multiuse national priority projects.” In a March 14 news release announcing his new cabinet, Mr. Carney said the team would work to defend Canada’s sovereignty in the face of unjustified trade actions by the United States, “make Canada an energy superpower in both conventional and clean energy” and “create new trade corridors with reliable partners.” Carolyn Svonkin, a spokesperson for Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, criticized Mr. Poilievre’s LNG announcement, saying the province rejected the project “based on potentially catastrophic environmental consequences, lack of social license and opposition of local Indigenous groups.” In an e-mail, Ms. Svonkin described the announcement as “a desperate attempt to bend to his oil and gas CEO friends and donors.” With a report from The Canadian Press","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Curry, Bill; Jones, Jeffrey",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 21, 2025",International trade; Political campaigns; Infrastructure; Clean technology; Liquefied natural gas; Native North Americans; Equity funds; Pipelines,,2025-03-21,The Globe and Mail
"Data Dive with Nik Nanos: The Conservatives were running away in the polls. But the federal election has become a horserace:   How do we explain the swing in public opinion? It’s clear that the Conservatives’ lead in the polls was not an embrace of Poilievre or his party’s policies. Rather, it was a repudiation of Trudeau and his government",2025.0,"Nik Nanos is the chief data scientist at Nanos Research, research adjunct professor at the Norman Paterson School for International Affairs at Carleton University, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington and the official pollster for The Globe and Mail and CTV News. By the end of 2024, the next Canadian federal election was shaping up to be a car crash for the Liberals. The party, which has been in power since 2015, seemed destined for political exile. Despite weathering U.S. President Donald Trump’s first term, the pandemic, the SNC-Lavalin affair and the WE charity controversy – or probably because of these things – Justin Trudeau had become a polarizing figure, while Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was probably measuring the drapes in the Prime Minister’s Office. With a massive 27-point Conservative advantage at the beginning of 2025, the expected showdown between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Poilievre was shaping up to be a disaster for a tired Liberal government that had hit its best-before date. Not often does one see massive, short-term swings in a non-election campaign period. But Mr. Trudeau’s resignation, Mr. Trump’s musings on tariffs and the subsequent election of Mark Carney as Liberal Leader, has resulted in a significant change. The upcoming federal election is going to be a horse race. How do we explain the swing in public opinion? It’s clear that the Conservatives’ lead in the polls was not an embrace of Mr. Poilievre or his party’s policies. Rather, it was a repudiation of Mr. Trudeau and his government. Apart from the race narrowing, two other data trends have redrawn the battle lines for the next election. At the end of 2024, 54 per cent of Canadians said they would consider voting Conservative. That has since declined to 43 per cent. In late December, only 35 per cent of Canadians said they would consider voting Liberal. That has now increased to 50 per cent, surpassing the Conservatives. The anger once directed at Mr. Trudeau has shifted toward Mr. Trump. When we asked an open-ended question regarding today’s top national issue of concern, Mr. Trump received the most responses – concern about Mr. Trump and U.S.-Canada relations received 27 per cent of the responses, up 12 points in four weeks. When asked what will influence their vote, a recent CTV News/Nanos survey suggests two of three Canadians will be swayed by who they think can best deal with Mr. Trump (36 per cent). Mr. Trump has triggered an unusual mix of emotions in Canadians. A new Globe and Mail/Nanos survey shows that Canadians are experiencing anxiousness for the future (67 per cent), are avoiding the internet/news (31 per cent) and feeling financial stress (23 per cent) as a result of the current diplomatic tensions with the United States. The same survey shows that our self-image as a nation has improved (30 per cent) or somewhat improved (25 per cent) over the past year, while our view of the U.S. has fallen off a cliff. Almost nine in 10 Canadians say their opinion of the United States has worsened (78 per cent) or somewhat worsened (10 per cent) compared to a year ago. Add to the emotion the dampening consumer confidence which started literally the day after Mr. Trump won the presidency. In advance of November’s U.S. election, Canadian consumer confidence, as measured by the Bloomberg/Nanos Canadian Consumer Confidence Index, was in positive territory. That’s no longer the case, and about six in 10 Canadians think the economy will further weaken over the next year. The combination of Mr. Trump’s assault on the Canadian economy and Mr. Trudeau’s resignation in short succession have been game changers, refocusing voters on the future instead of the past. If the next election was about the past 10 years, Mr. Poilievre would be riding high and crushing the Liberals. Right now, the next election is shaping up to be one about the future and who could best navigate the changing world order. Buckle up, because the federal election is going to be a wild ride. When the numbers swing quickly in one direction, they can swing again and yet again. Today’s trend line, which is favouring the Liberals, can change – and change quickly. We can also throw preconceptions about party loyalty or anger at the incumbents out the door. Expect voters to size up the choices not based on their track record or snappy sound bites but on a cold, hard assessment as to who can best deal with Mr. Trump and who can help Canada best navigate a changing world economy. Speaking of Mr. Trump, he is both an accelerant and enabler of instability. Expect the party leaders to see both their political rivals and Mr. Trump as their opponents. The prolific and almost daily commentary from the White House on Canada will undermine the ability of Canadian political leaders to shape the narrative of the coming campaign. The ironic twist is that for a nation fixated on possible foreign interference in our democracy, the 2025 election could very well showcase another country’s open and transparent influence on the Canadian election. Canadians face some very clear yet imperfect choices. On the one hand, Mr. Poilievre is a battle-hardened and disciplined politician. On the other hand, Mr. Carney can claim experience navigating things like the Great Recession and Brexit, but remains politically untested. A competitive election is good for democracy and good for those who aspire to lead our nation. This campaign will likely be as important as the epic 1988 free-trade election, when Canadians laid the track for the country’s future. The outcome is uncertain, though one thing isn’t: Everyone’s vote will matter this time.

"Poilievre, Singh call on Carney to publicly disclose assets, possible conflicts",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Opposition parties are not letting the story of Prime Minister Mark Carney's alleged conflicts of interest fade away. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Carney to do the ""right thing"" and disclose all his financial holdings so that Canadians ""can judge the conflicts he faces"" for themselves. ""He knows what he owns and there is nothing in the law that prevents him from publishing that information for all eyes to see if he has nothing to hide,"" Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que. ""We need a leader that is busy putting Canada first, not keeping an eye on investments that go against Canadian interests,"" he added. In Hamilton, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh echoed Poilievre's call for more accountability. ""Every other candidate for prime minister has to disclose very clearly their assets,"" Singh said. ""It is an understandable thing for Canadians to make a decision about who they want to govern the country to know: Do they have any conflict of interests? What are they? ""The fact that he's unwilling to do that shows a fear of accountability, and I want Canadians to pay attention to that."" The National Post has asked Carney's office to address the Opposition's statements and is awaiting a response. Carney admitted this week, after repeated questions from the media, that he expects to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest related to his past work as chairman at Brookfield Asset Management, which describes itself on its website as ""a leading global investment firm with over $1 trillion of assets under management."" However, Carney said the process to determine what ethical ""screens"" he would be subject to is still in discussions with the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. Bay Street insiders question Carney's 'placebo' blind trust as Brookfield ties come under scrutiny 'Look inside yourself': Carney gets snippy at reporter when pressed on conflicts of interest The process can take months, so Canadians could likely be heading to the polls in just a few weeks not knowing if Carney is subject to any conflicts of interest. ""He admitted the other day, in a stunning flip flop, that he has conflicts of interests that he will have to manage. But he won't tell us what those conflicts are,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects us to elect him without knowing the many millions of dollars of conflicts that will make it impossible for him to do his job."" Carney has said he went beyond what the Conflict of Interest Act demands, given that he put his assets in a blind trust as soon as he was elected Liberal leader. The law - which Poilievre helped adopt when he was in Stephen Harper's government - requires that public office holders divest their assets or put them in a blind trust within 120 days. The ethics commissioner is expected to publish a public summary of Carney's personal and financial information in that same timeframe, but it could be available sooner. Poilievre is effectively asking Carney to go above and beyond what the law requires, given the unusual and quick succession of events that led to him becoming prime minister. When Carney was asked this week why he is not disclosing his assets proactively, he responded that it is a question that is for the ethics commissioner. Questions have been swirling on Bay Street about Carney's financial assets and his recent links to Brookfield. Until this past January, Carney was still serving as the company's chair and head of transition investing. He stepped down to run for Liberal leader. As a Brookfield employee, according to the corporation's annual report, he was entitled to stock options with a market value of more than $6.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. But most of his compensation, observers said, is likely stemming from the money he is entitled to as co-manager of three of Brookfield's biggest funds. Conservatives have remarked Carney could find himself in conflicts of interest for clean energy transition projects, for which he raised billions of dollars across the world. Brookfield and Carney's team have so far declined to say if he has put Brookfield assets in his blind trust, but recent comments suggest that is the case. Speaking in Iqaluit on Tuesday, Carney said in French ""it's clear"" he expects an ethics screen to apply to him if a government decision ""has a major impact for Brookfield."" Carney's finance minister declined to comment on whether Carney should publicly disclose his financial assets to reassure Canadians. ""I think he answered that question,"" said François-Philippe Champagne. Poilievre, meanwhile, was questioned on his party's controversial decision to not have media outlets travelling with him in the upcoming election, which is expected to be called Sunday. ""Local media will have the ability to ask questions. It will be refreshing to hear from local outlets and what they have to say about their local priorities,"" he said. Singh said the other leaders have shown they cannot take the heat from the media. ""Well, it's no surprise to me that Pierre Poilievre is afraid of some questions."" ""I'm sorry to say I think Mark Carney is showing that as well.""

Poilievre says Trump is right about Liberals,2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump said it is ""easier to deal"" with a Liberal than a Conservative, and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is taking it as a compliment. ""You know what? On that point, it's true,"" said Poilievre, speaking to reporters at a news conference hosted by a construction company Sudbury, Ont., on Wednesday. ""I'm a strong leader, I'm a tough guy to deal with. I'm firm in my convictions and I'll always put Canada first,"" he added, referring to his latest slogan, ""Canada First,"" which he has been repeating since the start of the U.S. trade war with Canada. Poilievre said it is no wonder that Trump would rather have to deal with a Liberal prime minister instead of him, pointing to how, in his view, Liberals have been blocking energy resource projects, hiking taxes and driving investments to the U.S. in the last nine years. He also pointed to Brookfield Asset Management's decision to move its head office from Toronto to New York, which happened under Prime Minister Mark Carney's tenure as chair. The decision happened around the same time as Trump was re-elected for his second term in the U.S. He threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. Pointing to the workers behind him, Poilievre said: ""While these people here were worried about losing their jobs, Mark Carney was busy moving jobs to Trump's hometown."" ""That's exactly the kind of weak, compromised, conflicted leadership that Donald Trump wants, and it's why he endorsed Mark Carney yesterday."" Trump did not explicitly endorse Carney during his interview with Fox News. In the interview, which aired Tuesday evening, Trump was asked about the changing polls in Canada that show that Carney's Liberals could form the next government after the next election - overtaking Poilievre's Conservative party that had previously enjoyed a comfortable lead. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,"" Trump said. The U.S. president went on to take a shot at Poilievre, saying that ""the Conservative that's running is stupidly no friend of mine."" ""I don't know, but he said negative things. So, when he says negative things, I couldn't care less,"" he said. It is not the first time that Trump has criticized the leader of Canada's Conservatives. In an interview with the Spectator published in February, Trump said that Poilievre's ""biggest problem is he's not a MAGA guy,"" referring to his ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. ""I mean, he's really not, he's not a Trump guy at all,"" Trump added. ""Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA. I am for Canada First. Always,"" Poilievre wrote on X in response.

Pierre Poilievre promises to speed up Ring of Fire; Conservative leader also tells press conference that Sudbury is a logical place to process the minerals extracted from the region,2025.0,"Developing the mineral-rich Ring of Fire area in northwestern Ontario has been stalled for a decade thanks to the federal Liberal government and it's time to start getting shovels in the ground, says Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre. ""My government will set a deadline of six months to green light permits for the Ring of Fire,"" Poilievre, accompanied by his wife Anaida, said during a press conference at the Pioneer Construction facility in Greater Sudbury on Wednesday. Poilievre, who was also to attend a Canada First rally at the Radisson Hotel in the downtown core later in the day, said a Conservative Government would also help the Ontario government to build a highway to get to the Ring of Fire development, as well as help with the building of infrastructure needed to develop the site and clear the way for mining. Decades of exploration have turned up nickel, copper, chromite, platinum and other metals in the area around the James Bay Lowlands that miners call the Ring of Fire, but the area lacks an all-season road connecting it to the southern portion of Ontario. Poilievre said his government would commit $1 billion over three years to building roads. Currently, Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest's Wyloo Metals Ltd. controls the most advanced mine projects in the area, after acquiring Toronto-based Noront Resources Ltd. in 2021 for around $617 million in cash. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has been seeking to advance the project and has pledged to commit up to $1 billion in government funding to build infrastructure in the area. However, federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has taken a more circumspect tone, calling it ""a particularly challenging area"" in reference to the geography and the sentiment of some Indigenous communities in the area. ""There is a lot of that area that is peat,"" he said at a press conference in 2022. ""And there are also several Indigenous nations that have raised concerns and certainly questions about development in that space. Both of those issues have to be addressed in any agreement."" The federal government is in the midst of a larger study of the environmental impacts of the proposed roads and projects in the area. In January, it said it had finalized the terms of reference for a regional study. Asked by a reporter if the minerals of the Ring of Fire should be processed in Greater Sudbury, Poilievre said ""Sudbury is the hub"" and the obvious place where the minerals of the Ring of Fire should be going, where workers can process them prepared for shipping around the world. ""It's going to be a really bright future for workers here in Sudbury, "" he said. Related story: Wyloo Canada to build Ring of Fire facility in Sudbury Related story: 'We believe Canada needs more nickel,' Wyloo boss says Poilievre said development of the Ring of Fire ""will make Canada very rich. It will galvanize Northern Ontario towns,"" as well as making First Nation communities in the north better off. ""We've known about this project for a long time,"" he said. ""Why are there no shovels in the ground? ...The Liberals have done everything they could to block the project. They have been sitting on the permits for five years."" Poilievre said that after 10 years of stalled development, ""the Ring of Fire is on the verge of collapse."" The Conservative leader also said that over the past decade, Canada's economic growth has fallen behind its competitors around the globe and, in the process, helped to make the United States stronger. Poilievre said his party understands that the wealth created by developing Canadian resources will benefit all Canadians and improve Canada's economy at the same time. ""We will stand up for the economy and our people,"" he said. Turning to the Pioneer Construction employees standing behind him, Poilievre told them ""you deserve a good life, a wonderful home in a wonderful community, protected by our brave troops."" Poilievre said 10 years of Liberal governments have meant nothing but a steady drain on Canadians and a weakened economy, leading to the loss of half a trillion dollars in investment to the United States and ""making us more dependent (on the U.S)."" The Conservative leader noted that American President Donald Trump has just remarked that ""having a Liberal prime minister would be easier to deal with."" Poilievre said that's not going to be the case if the Conservatives win the next federal election. ""I'm a strong leader,"" he said. ""I'm a tough guy to deal with ... I will always put Canada first."" Poilievre said new Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney moved his corporate head offices to New York City - Trump's home city - which led to jobs being transferred to the United States. Polilievre said that steps a Conservative government would take - such as promoting development, cracking down on crime through measures such as ""jail, not bail"", and addressing the opioid crisis - will help make Canada ""become a strong, self-reliant and sovereign nation"" again. ""Most of all, we will make Canada a place, a country, where anyone from anywhere can do anything,"" he said. Asked by a reporter if his admission that his political style is ""too direct:"" and ""too blunt,"" Poilievre said he has no plans to soften that style in the time leading up to the next federal election. ""I think we need a strong leader, a leader who will work on doing something,"" he said. Poilievre added that after a decade of Liberal governments in Ottawa, Canadians are now dealing with a higher cost of living and housing prices that make it nearly impossible to buy a home. ""I have been very blunt in speaking out about things and I have been very blunt about speaking of solutions: lower the taxes, so workers can keep more of their paycheques,"" he said.

Poilievre says Trump is right about Liberals,2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump said it is ""easier to deal"" with a Liberal than a Conservative, and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is taking it as a compliment. ""You know what? On that point, it's true,"" said Poilievre, speaking to reporters at a news conference hosted by a construction company in Sudbury, Ont., on Wednesday. ""I'm a strong leader, I'm a tough guy to deal with. I'm firm in my convictions and I'll always put Canada first,"" he added, referring to his latest slogan, Canada First. Poilievre said it is no wonder Trump would rather deal with a Liberal prime minister instead of him, pointing to how, in his view, Liberals have been blocking energy projects, hiking taxes and driving investments to the U.S. He also pointed to Brookfield Asset Management's decision to move its head office from Toronto to New York, which happened under Prime Minister Mark Carney's tenure as chair. Pointing to the workers behind him, Poilievre said: ""While these people here were worried about losing their jobs, Mark Carney was busy moving jobs to Trump's hometown."" ""That's exactly the kind of weak, compromised, conflicted leadership that Donald Trump wants, and it's why he endorsed Mark Carney yesterday."" Trump did not explicitly endorse Carney during his interview with Fox News. In the interview Tuesday evening, Trump was asked about the changing polls in Canada that show that Carney's Liberals could form the next government after the next election - overtaking Poilievre's Conservative party that had previously enjoyed a comfortable lead. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,"" Trump said. The U.S. president went on to take a shot at Poilievre, saying that ""the Conservative that's running is stupidly no friend of mine."" ""I don't know, but he said negative things. So, when he says negative things, I couldn't care less,"" he said. - With files from Bloomberg calevesque@postmedia.com","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lévesque, Carine",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 20, 2025",Political leadership; Prime ministers,,2025-03-20,The Province

He also pointed to Brookfield Asset Management's decision to move its head office from Toronto to New York, which happened under Prime Minister Mark Carney's tenure as chair.

""I mean, he's really not, he's not a Trump guy at all,"" Trump added. ""Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA. I am for Canada First. Always,"" Poilievre wrote on X in response. Carney is expected to call a national election soon, and he has been portraying himself as an experienced crisis manager.

Inside Biblioasis and Mark Bourrie’s mad rush to get a Pierre Poilievre bio on shelves:   The author and publisher pulled out the stops to ensure the biography Ripper: The Making of Pierre Poilievre would hit the shelves a month early ahead of a likely spring election,2025.0,"The world was a very different place last May, when historian Mark Bourrie met Biblioasis publisher Dan Wells for coffee in Windsor, Ont., to discuss a book idea. Polling at the time suggested Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was a prime minister in waiting. A book about his rise and the ideas that moulded him sounded like a good proposition. Maybe it could be short, they discussed; maybe they could even get it onto shelves in a year, ahead of the fall 2025 election deadline. Books tend to lag behind the news cycle, however, and this news cycle has been unrelenting – completely reshaping the context for a book examining Poilievre and how his particular brand of populism has been bred and spread. Donald Trump has been re-elected U.S. President, forcing the world to reckon with his whims. A Canadian federal election looks imminent, and the Liberals have a new leader in Mark Carney, who appears to be dampening his rival’s electoral chances. Bourrie’s book changed just as rapidly: After just nine months of gestation, its 437 pages are back from the printer and hitting shelves in Ontario this week, nearly a month ahead of its originally planned April release. ""It’s an intense subject, the future of Canada – there isn’t anything more important than that, and at a time of revolution, which I think we are in,"" he says. Deeply researched non-fiction works usually take much longer to come together. They can often require years of sifting through documents and interviewing key players before a word is written. The expedited timeline of Ripper: The Making of Pierre Poilievre nearly broke Bourrie – a lawyer, journalist and RBC Taylor Prize winner who’s written 15 other books. Bourrie cut back the publicity for his 2024 history book Crosses in the Sky: Jean de Brébeuf and the Destruction of Huronia when he began Ripper , eager to unpack the idea he and Wells had first discussed for a shorter book. But then he filed 105,000 words last fall, and wrote an additional 45,000 in the first five weeks of 2025 – after Chrystia Freeland’s resignation from cabinet spurred a leadership race and Trump cast decades of geopolitical stability into disarray. Bourrie quickly found that Poilievre had lived his life on the public record even as a teenager, penning sometimes scathing letters to outlets such as The Calgary Herald. The story was there; he just needed to collate the pieces. In December, when Freeland threw federal politics into disarray, Wells realized that his plan to publish in May or June of this year simply wouldn’t work. His response was to throw everything at it. Every other task he had as head of Biblioasis – grant reports, different manuscripts – fell to the wayside as he worked through Christmas, New Year’s and all of January, sometimes 70 hours a week, reading and editing chapters. Even now, nearly six weeks after putting Ripper to bed, ""I’ve never felt further behind,"" he says. Wages aside, Wells estimates this was a $100,000 project, putting a massive dent into Biblioasis’s cash flow. But thanks to an unexpectedly quick turnaround from the book’s printer, Friesens, Ripper should be available across the country by early next week. ""If this book doesn’t reach as many readers"" as initially hoped for when the lead time before an expected election was longer, ""we will have to take our lumps,"" Wells says. ""We would like to sell as many books as we can, but our goal here was to try to put on the public record everything we felt needed to be there"" for voters. ""In that sense, it’s mission accomplished."" Sutherland House Books last year published a Poilievre biography by Andrew Lawton, who took a sympathetic view of the Conservative leader – and then sought a Conservative riding nomination in Ontario. Bourrie wanted to take a more critical lens to Poilievre’s life. (His book refers to Lawton’s treatment of the politician as ""soft-gloved."") Bourrie argues that the Conservative leader’s worldview was already deeply established by the time he entered university. ""I looked at what he said then and what he says now. There isn’t a lot of development intellectually or politically. The myths and slogans of his teenage years are still his political foundation."" The author says he ""bent over backwards to be fair"" to Poilievre, but felt a moral obligation to contextualize the leader on the record. "" I don’t think that Pierre Poilievre is anywhere near the extreme threat of a Donald Trump or a Viktor Orban."" Ripper is one of several Canadian political books whose publication plans have recently been thrown astray. House of Anansi rushed to get Catherine Tsalikis’s Freeland biography onto shelves in December after the politician’s cabinet resignation, and McClelland and Stewart/Signal has delayed publication of Carney’s new book The Hinge , initially scheduled for a May 13 release.

Poilievre promotes reviving LNG project in Quebec’s Saguenay region:   Pro posed $14-billion project had been rejected by two levels of government over environmental and other concerns,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre visited Quebec’s Saguenay region Thursday to promote the revival of a $14-billion liquefied natural gas project, pledging to create ""shovel-ready"" zones for resource projects across the country. The Quebec government refused to authorize GNL Québec Inc.’s proposed liquefaction facility and export terminal in 2021 and Ottawa followed suit in 2022, with both governments citing environmental and other concerns. The project would have involved transporting natural gas, likely from Western Canada, using an existing pipeline network. A new 650-kilometre gas pipeline would be needed to connect the network to the proposed plant. The Quebec government said last month that it would be open to reviving the project as a way of diversifying Canada’s export markets in light of U.S. President Donald Trump’s approved and threatened tariffs on Canadian imports. The federal election campaign is not expected to officially start until Sunday, but Mr. Poilievre is touring the country this week holding campaign-style events. He made a similar announcement the day before during a stop in Sudbury, where he pledged to speed up permitting for mining projects in Northern Ontario’s Ring of Fire region. The Ring of Fire project has faced several delays related to environmental approvals and consultations with Indigenous communities. While some First Nations are open to development in the area, others are strongly opposed. The Quebec government had rejected the LNG project on the grounds that it did not have social acceptability in the province. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway had been interested in investing $4-billion in the project, but backed away in 2020, citing Canada’s ""current political context."" The developer, Ruby River Capital LLC, a partnership of two U.S. private equity funds, responded to the rejection by initiating a NAFTA claim against the Canadian government seeking to recoup US$120-million in sunk costs, and an another US$20-billion in lost profits, as damages. Mr. Poilievre said President Trump’s policies have altered what Quebeckers view as acceptable. ""The status quo does not have social acceptability,"" Mr. Poilievre said in French. He said northern Quebec can liquefy natural gas with fewer emissions because of its hydroelectric power resources and colder climate. ""I am convinced that we can secure social acceptability,"" he said. A Conservative government would take the steps to have the project pre-approved, he said, ""so that we can ship western Canadian LNG through a pipeline to this region, liquefy it here, using the great workers of the Saguenay to get it done."" The Montreal Economic Institute think tank issued a report on Thursday that estimated the 10.5-million-tonne-per-year project would have diverted nearly 19.4 per cent of Canadian gas exports away from the United States to overseas markets had it been operating in 2024, representing ""value"" of $1.7-billion. Officials from the U.S. backers of the project, Freestone International LLC and Breyer Capital LLC, did not immediately respond to queries about whether they would consider reviving the project. Speaking more broadly, Mr. Poilievre said he would create ""Canada Shovel-Ready Zones"" throughout the country to pre-permit projects such as power stations, LNG plants and pipelines. He said this can be done with ""rigorous"" environmental studies, while working with other levels of government and consulting First Nations. ""The goal will be to-pre publish permits online so that everybody knows, and next time, investors don’t have to fear that they’re going to waste so much money on lawyers and fees all to get to nothing,"" he said. Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged during the recent Liberal Party leadership race that he would expand and modernize Canada’s energy infrastructure to diversify trade. His campaign mentioned both clean energy and fossil fuels, but he did not clarify the weight of planned support for each sector. The Carney leadership campaign platform did include a pledge to designate ""critical infrastructure corridors,"" which sounds similar to Mr. Poilievre’s Thursday pledge of ""shovel-ready"" zones. Mr. Carney’s infrastructure corridors pledge was described as a plan to ""allow for rapid designation of corridors pre-approved for multi-use National Priority Projects."" In a March 14 news release announcing his new cabinet, Mr. Carney said the team would work to defend Canada’s sovereignty in the face of unjustified trade actions by the United States, ""make Canada an energy superpower in both conventional and clean energy"" and ""create new trade corridors with reliable partners."" Carolyn Svonkin, a spokesperson for Liberal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, criticized Mr. Poilievre’s LNG announcement, saying the province rejected the project ""based on potentially catastrophic environmental consequences, lack of social license and opposition of local Indigenous groups."" In an e-mail, Ms. Svonkin described Mr. Poilievre’s announcement as ""a desperate attempt to bend to his oil and gas CEO friends and donors."" With a report from The Canadian Press.

"How the Conservatives can save themselves: Changing Canada’s image as the great white weakling of the North:   Massive defence spending could help Pierre Poilievre reverse his party’s fortunes, steal the Liberals’ thunder and make Canada a country whose strength is respected",2025.0,"If it isn’t panic time for Pierre Poilievre and his henchwoman, Jenni Byrne, it should be. The Conservatives are being buried under an avalanche of Liberal momentum – a 20- to 25-percentage-point leap in the polls for the Liberals in just two months. Mr. Poilievre and Ms. Byrne were obsessed with Justin Trudeau – but now he’s gone. They were obsessed with the carbon tax as the coming election’s main issue – but it’s no longer a major factor. Had they had their lights bulbs on, they might have figured that the Liberals would choose a new leader who would drop the tax. It seems they didn’t. The third development that’s killing the Conservatives – and this one’s not their fault – is Donald Trump’s insane attacks on the country. The big issue is who can best defend against him, and polls suggest it is Liberal Leader Mark Carney who is ahead on that score. The second biggest issue is the economy, and the big banker, to whom Stephen Harper once offered the Finance portfolio, has the upper hand there as well. Unless there’s a collapse from the rookie campaigner, Mr. Poilievre will have to put something bold and dramatic in his department-store window to turn back the Liberal tide. He needs an issue that will wrestle the defender-of-Canada advantage away from them. But there is a grand opening for him, assuming the Liberals don’t make the leap themselves. In Canadian nation-building, there is one great step that is still to be taken. It is making the country a military power – ridding Canada of its reputation as a great white weakling of the North and making it a country whose strength is respected. With the unprecedented external threat to Canadian peace and prosperity, and with patriotism sweeping the land, what better time to launch this historic turn than now? Ever since Mr. Trump started his territorial and tariff aggression, the Canadian response has been impressive in many areas – except for the one that counts most. Neither major party has come up with a new defence strategy, one that calls for a major military build-up to meet the new challenges. In today’s circumstances, doubling our defence spending should be the goal. That would take spending close to 3 per cent of GDP, well above our NATO commitment of 2 per cent. Currently, the Liberals have pledged to raise spending to 2 per cent, but not until 2032. The U.S., for its part, is contributing 3.5 per cent of its GDP. The great leap would obviously make the country much better prepared to face threats. It would also raise Canada’s confidence level, silence the critics who have belittled our military might, and give Ottawa more clout in multilateral forums. Of course, the question of how to pay for such a dramatic escalation would present a huge hurdle. But in an extreme crisis, you find a way. Canadians are in such a mood that they could be convinced to support such an initiative. It will take guts on the part of a leader, like Brian Mulroney demonstrated on free trade. The Liberals could undertake such a move, but are weighed down already by their big-spending image and are unlikely to entertain such bold new thinking. For Conservatives, though – what a way to steal the ""Canada Strong"" thunder from their opponents. It would mark a remarkable turn, because so far Mr. Poilievre has been largely absent in the defence-spending debate. He was reluctant to even commit to moving to the 2 per cent goal until just last month, when his office said he would ""work toward meeting"" that number. Many would see an increase as kowtowing to Donald Trump, who has demanded much greater defence-spending contributions by NATO members. But he’s made progress with Canada and other countries on that score already. A doubling by Ottawa could serve to lessen his demands on other fronts. Canadians, their governments and observers such as myself have never been keen on great heaps of defence spending. That’s for several reasons: by the luck of location we’re not located in a war theatre like European nations; we haven’t been invaded since 1812; and in neighbouring U.S., the Pentagon has been outspending rival nations on defence by ridiculous amounts. Canada’s small spending on the military – which didn’t prevent us from making a big contribution in Afghanistan – has allowed us to build a much stronger social safety net than the U.S.’s over time. But with Mr. Trump ushering in a new law-of-the-jungle world disorder, and with his breaking of the historic bond with Canada, the construct that has guided our thinking has been shattered.

Poilievre blasted on Ring of Fire pledge:   First Nations leader warns Tory leader northern communities 'are not ready' for development,2025.0,"The grand chief of a group of northern Ontario First Nations is blasting Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre over his promise to fast-track approvals and pump money into the Ring of Fire mineral region. Poilievre made the pre-campaign pledge Wednesday in Sudbury, promising to green light all federal assessments for the area within six months if his Conservatives form the next government. He also said a Conservative administration would spend $1 billion over three years to help build a ""long overdue"" road into the mineral-rich northern region. The Tory leader said the move would help open up long-sought mining development to provide an economic boost to Canada and affected Indigenous communities. But in an interview with the Star, Alvin Fiddler, Grand Chief of Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN), said that if Poilievre were to take such ""extreme"" steps, he ""would be met with fierce resistance on the ground because our communities are not ready."" NAN represents 49 First Nations in northern Ontario, several of which surround the Ring of Fire, a region that has long sparked hopes for a mining bonanza in the vast area about 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay that is rich in chromite, cobalt, nickel, copper and other minerals. In pushing for fast-track approval, Poilievre slammed the current Liberal government for allegedly blocking development, and failing more broadly to approve projects that could reduce Canada's reliance on the United States as President Donald Trump threatens trade tariffs. But Fiddler said the timeline Poilievre laid out Wednesday is far too short for First Nations that will be most impacted by development in the region. And he said the Conservative leader's proposal - despite Poilievre's framing of his commitment as a partnership with First Nations - violates the principle of free, prior and informed consent that underpins the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). ""Canada First cannot mean First Nations last,"" Fiddler said, referring to Poilievre's political tag line. It's the second time in as many months that a Poilievre promise was criticized by a local leader. In February, Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok raised concerns about not being consulted before the Conservative leader travelled to Iqaluit to announce a plan to build a military base there. On Wednesday, Poilievre said developing the Ring of Fire would bring riches to Northern Ontario, and that a Conservative government would share some of collected federal tax from the development with First Nations. The chiefs of Webequie and Marten Falls First Nations, both part of NAN, released a statement Wednesday welcoming Poilievre's announcement, and said his proposal would create ""long-term economic opportunities"" for First Nations in the area. Poilievre is not the only political leader keen on accelerating development in the region. Fiddler slammed Premier Doug Ford during the recent provincial election campaign, after Ford promised to speed up approvals and triple an existing First Nations loan guarantee program to $3 billion to help Indigenous communities buy into projects they support. Fiddler had called on Ford to retract the promise and work with First Nations as full partners. Like Poilievre, Ford has championed the economic potential of mining in a region rich in minerals that could feed into green industries like electric vehicles. He has also criticized the federal government for engaging in lengthy environmental assessments alongside provincial reviews. The federal Impact Assessment Agency has been doing a regional assessment with affected First Nations since 2020, and agreed on terms to conduct that assessment in January. There are also proposals under review at the federal level to build roads into the region. Poilievre has also pledged to scrap the Liberal government's impact assessment regime, which the Conservatives blame for slowing major development projects, including mines and pipelines. Prime Minister Mark Carney has also pledged to speed up projects, arguing faster development would fortify the Canadian economy. A group of fossil fuel and pipeline companies wrote an open letter this week to all party leaders urging Ottawa to use emergency powers to speed up projects in the ""national interest."" In Sudbury, Poilievre accused the Liberal government of slowing progress in the Ring of Fire, arguing Ontario is already doing all the assessments needed to clear the region for development. He also alleged the federal requirement for provinces to have a minimum carbon price on heavy industries - a major contributor to Canada's climate action that Poilievre vows to dismantle - is hampering the mining sector. The federal government has previously expressed doubts about development in the Ring of Fire. In 2023, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said it would be complicated to start mining in the Ring of Fire, and that there are simpler and faster projects elsewhere in Ontario.

It reminded me of the occasional outburst from former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. I'm all for respecting journalists, but it's a two-way street. We need to be more respectful to our politicians, too. These questions have been asked and answered multiple times by the prime minister. I'm not surprised he had had enough of it. The financial disclosure, when it comes, will be pounced on and sliced and diced until we are tired of hearing about it. Yes, the man is wealthy - get over it. I for one want a successful, well-travelled, well connected prime minister. He will represent us well on the world stage at a time when we need to raise our profile. I get that there is a conflict-of-interest issue to navigate. Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, knows what he has to do to satisfy that requirement. Carole Arsenault, Hamilton Give me a leader who offers more than buzz words Prime Minister Mark Carney has earlier than required put his finances in a blind trust and is working with the ethics commissioner. Canada's conflict of interest laws have been followed. Carney has refused to play politics with his finances. To me that is his appeal. Instead of massaging the truth, Carney tells the truth and expects that the truth is sufficient. I am tired of listening to politicians telling half-truths to paint the opponent as ""crafty"" or ""dishonest"" or ""deceptive."" I am tired of politicians who make up their own rules. At this time of such great consequence, I need a leader who lays out their plan straightforwardly and truthfully. This next leader can bring Canada to new heights or destroy our country. So, give me a leader who thinks beyond buzz words and instead formulates a plan for the future and gives me in straight talk. Bonnie Bacvar, Toronto Conservatives have a problem with leadership Pierre Poilievre has a bigger problem than Mark Carney. Much bigger, Opinion, March 17 On Wednesday in Sudbury, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attempted to appear more ""prime ministerial"" and, as usual, his organized event took only questions that fitted within his narrative, allowing him to avoid being properly challenged. Proof of this attempt to control their leader's narrative: the Conservative national campaign director told media outlets on Tuesday their journalists won't be allowed to travel with the leader during the election. Skeptically, as the Conservatives enjoy a relationship with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance via MP Jamil Jivani, it brings into question U.S. President Donald Trump's comment, ""a Liberal would be easier to deal with"" than Poilievre."" The timing is suspicious given Poilievre's drop in the polls. Thing is, when one party moves so far to the right, it makes it critical for the electorate to decide who will constructively deal with our country's challenges. I am convinced that isn't Poilievre. William Perry, Victoria Tossing reporters off campaign bus is a stupid idea Pierre Poilievre won't let reporters travel with him in coming election campaign, March 18 Having covered several national election campaigns and dozens of provincial campaigns during 50-plus years as a journalist, I've seen political parties do a lot of stupid things. But Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's decision to boot journalists off the campaign planes and buses represents a new level of stupidity. They claim it will be ""one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory."" No, it won't. It is logistically impossible to keep up with multiple daily campaign events without being on the campaign transport. And for those who think it's a free ride for the media, it isn't. News outlets pay for each seat. To quote the legendary Forrest Gump, ""stupid is as stupid does."" Claire Hoy, Toronto Protect Canada's dairy industry Is it time to rethink our decades-old supply management system? March 19 Oh sure, sacrifice Canadian farmers to save automobiles. Tariff Chinese EV's at 100 per cent, then watch China tariff Canadian soybeans. Cave in to U.S. complaints about supply management for what? Tasting hormones in U.S. milk? Watching Wisconsin dairy farmers dumping its over-produced milk? Competing with the giant U.S. subsidies given to U.S. dairy? This opens a can of worms - or a can of rattlesnakes. Leave Canadian dairy alone. Buy the Blue Cow brand and, if you want to ""rethink"" supply management, you will be left in awestruck admiration for its power and simplicity. Sheila Craig, Barrie Let Carney try to prove his worth In the 40-plus years I have been voting, I've always voted Conservative. However, I might be switching teams in the soon-to-be-called federal election. Both parties have questionable leaders, but I have to admit Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has not given me the confidence as a leader to secure my vote. Prime Minister Mark Carney might have what Canada needs in a leader, especially going up against U.S. President Donald Trump. So, before Poilievre tries to get an election called, let's give Carney six months to prove his worth as prime minister and see if he does a good enough job to keep it. Randy MacDonald, Ajax Replay clips of Trump praising CUSMA deal I've yet to see, as part of Canada's media strategy opposing tariffs, replays of U.S. President Donald Trump 1.0 signing the CUSMA trade agreement, in which he claimed it was the greatest trade agreement ever. Americans have been bombarded by Trump saying Canada has treated the U.S. so badly when it comes to trade.

Trump says Poilievre 'no friend of mine':   Tory leader claims U.S. president's words are an endorsement for Liberals,2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump has weighed in on an imminent Canadian election, calling Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre ""stupidly no friend of mine"" and stating it would be ""easier"" to deal with a Liberal leader at the country's helm. In response, Poilievre said the U.S. president wasn't wrong. ""It's clear that President Trump wants the Liberals in power because they will keep this country weak,"" he said Wednesday during a news conference in Sudbury. ""What Canadians need, though, is a leader who's tough and firm and stands by his convictions, a leader who will make Canada strong, self-reliant and stand on its own two feet, a leader who will put Canada first."" In an interview Tuesday evening with Fox News, Trump said his problem with Canada was that it was ""meant to be"" his country's 51st state, called it ""one of the nastiest countries to deal with,"" and reiterated his false claim that the U.S. ""subsidizes"" Canada to the tune of $200 billion per year. Repeating his list of trade irritants behind the tariff war between the two countries, Trump also attacked former prime minister Justin Trudeau, calling his government ""nasty"" and saying ""they never told the truth."" Challenged by host Laura Ingraham about the Liberals' rising electoral prospects in the wake of Trump's threats, the U.S. president repeatedly said, ""I don't care."" ""I would rather deal with a Liberal than a Conservative,"" Trump declared. ""The Conservative that's running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don't know him, but he said negative things. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal. And maybe they're gonna win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all."" Asked what his goal was, Trump said, ""My end game is, I don't want to have a big deficit."" Poilievre said Wednesday that the U.S. president's comments amount to an endorsement of Trudeau's successor, Prime Minister Mark Carney. ""Mark Carney will back down and his Liberal policies will keep Canada weak, just like Trump wants. Giving the Liberals a fourth term will only weaken our country and strengthen Donald Trump,"" Poilievre told reporters. The Liberal party has sought to tie the Conservative leader to the U.S. president, running an ad last month featuring clips of Poilievre criticizing Canada, its media and its political landscape alongside clips of Trump making similar comments. Trump has previously praised Poilievre, saying in January the Conservative leader's views are ""more aligned"" with his in comparison to Trudeau's, and that a Conservative victory would be ""very good."" But he also stated last month that Poilievre is ""not a MAGA guy,"" referring to Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. Poilievre has rebuffed such comparisons, particularly after Trump's comments last month. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Wednesday he ""could care less what Donald Trump wants or thinks in the context of Canadian politics."" ""Canadians ... are going to have a choice about prime minister and the choice will be between somebody who actually managed Canada through the last recession, and Britain through Brexit, and somebody who has never actually spent a day working in the private sector in his life,"" Wilkinson told reporters.

Watts lights the lamp twice in win:   Sceptres forward provides offence as goalie Campbell stands tall in tight victory over Sirens,2025.0,"Daryl Watts was everywhere. The Sceptres forward had the Coca-Cola Coliseum crowd buzzing Wednesday, weaving through New York Sirens defenders with ease and creating scoring chances at every turn. And those chances turned into goals. Watts ended the night scoring twice, leading the Sceptres to a 2-1 win over the PWHL's last-place Sirens. It all started late in the opening period. The Sceptres were pressing for the opening goal but couldn't solve New York goalie Corinne Schroeder. Watts found the breakthrough. She pounced on a turnover from New York defender Brooke Hobson, powered her way into the offensive zone, cut into the slot and fired a quick shot on goal. Before Schroeder could react, the Sceptres were up 1-0. That momentum carried into the second period. Watts scooped the puck off the boards, circled to the top of the faceoff circle and unleashed a shot through traffic. It deflected in front, bouncing past Schroeder to double the Sceptres' lead. The goals were Watts' seventh and eighth this season, bringing her to 23 points - just three shy of the league lead - and snapped a five-game goalless drought. Wednesday's breakout couldn't have come at a better time, as the Canadian national team roster for the upcoming women's world hockey championship will soon be announced. Watts, who made her national team debut in the Rivalry Series in November, is eager to secure a spot on the roster. The Sceptres moved one point behind the Boston Fleet for second in the six-team league and have six regular-season games remaining. They'll take on the Montreal Victoire next on Sunday and don't play at home again until April 29. Campbell for Canada Campbell is also vying for a spot on Canada's national team, especially with top goaltenders Ann-Renée Desbiens and Emerance Maschmeyer sidelined due to injuries. Maschmeyer was placed on long-term injured reserve earlier this month, and Desbiens was injured Tuesday. Campbell made a strong case for herself Wednesday, stopping 27 of 28 shots. The Manitoba-born goalie outdueled Schroeder, who stopped 27 of 29 and has been Canada's third-string goalie this season. Kjellbin's debut The Sceptres roster looked different from when they last hit the ice 10 days ago. They made the only move of the PWHL trade deadline last week, acquiring right-handed-shooting defender Anna Kjellbin from the Montreal Victoire for forward Kaitlyn Willoughby. The Sceptres lacked depth on the blue line after Lauren Bernard was signed from their reserve roster by the Sirens, leaving Jess Kondas as their only reserve defender. The Victoire drafted Kjellbin in the sixth round of the 2024 PWHL draft, and the Sceptres had her on their list of potential draftees, too, GM Gina Kingsbury said. ""We'll give her the opportunity to come in and showcase what she brings and see where she falls in the lineup,"" Kingsbury said. ""I definitely see her potentially in that five, six (defender) spot, potentially seven."" The 31-year-old is the captain of Sweden's national team and had just one point in 18 games with Montreal. She played 9:47 Wednesday and notched her first point with the Sceptres, an assist on Watts' second goal. Perfect penalty kill The Sceptres' power play has garnered plenty of attention, leading the league by more than 13 per cent heading into Wednesday. But their penalty kill has been equally impressive. They had killed 13 straight penalties entering Wednesday and were operating at a 91.4 per cent success rate over their last 10 games. They extended that streak to 18 on Wednesday, fending off all five Sirens power plays.

"Poilievre promises as PM to co-fund roads with Ontario into Ring of Fire, speed up development",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he’ll commit $1-billion to co-fund roads into the Ring of Fire and speed up permitting, but the Australian mining company at the heart of the main project in the area is non-committal about moving forward on the long-stalled development in Ontario’s Far North. The Ring of Fire, located 550 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, has long been promoted by politicians and some in the mining industry as holding a treasure trove of mineral riches that are crucial to Canada’s critical-minerals ambitions. But despite attempts by multiple large companies to move the project forward since a junior company made a promising nickel discovery in 2007, mining hasn’t yet occurred. A major obstacle has been the lack of basic infrastructure, such as grid power and roads in what is a remote forested region of the province mainly populated by First Nations. If Mr. Poilievre becomes prime minister in the coming federal election, and he follows through on his promise to provide the road funding, this would be the first time that both levels of government have agreed to finance a key part of the infrastructure. Ontario has already promised to commit about $1-billion into funding the roads and Premier Doug Ford has long needled the federal Liberals into making a commitment. The Ring of Fire is located about 300 kilometres north of the provincial highway network. Three sections of road have been proposed that would connect it to the network, and also tie several First Nations into that system. Webequie and Marten Falls First Nations, which are both leading federal environmental assessments into sections of the road construction, said in a joint statement that they welcomed the commitment from Mr. Poilievre, which also includes a provision for mining companies to share a portion of the taxes they pay with First Nations. “This investment responds directly to requests made by both First Nations for funding and aligns with their long-standing efforts to lead the development of sustainable infrastructure that will connect our communities, unlock critical resources, and create long-term economic opportunities,” they said in the statement. For Wyloo Pty Ltd., the Australian company that owns the most promising mining assets in the region, the funding of roads by both levels of government would remove one level of uncertainty over the economics of the project, because that is the only viable option for shipping ore out of the Ring of Fire. “I can’t think of a period of time in my tenure here, or in the tenure of the project, where we have had as much political support from the provincial perspective, and the potential for developing a federal level of support that is significantly different from the positioning of the current Liberal government,” Kristan Straub, chief executive Canada of Wyloo, said in an interview. Wyloo’s Eagle’s Nest nickel project is one of the few discoveries in the Ring of Fire where a feasibility study was conducted that showed the deposit could be economical to mine. Eagle’s Nest, however, has a short proven mine life of only 11 years, with the potential to expand production by an additional nine years. By comparison, there are nickel operations in Sudbury that have been in operation for more than 100 years. Wyloo is conducting a new feasibility study on the project as the previous one dates to 2012. Mr. Straub said there is no guarantee that the company will end up building the mine. “I can’t say that we will definitively build the operation,” he said. The long time frames in Canada around conducting environmental studies is a major factor clouding development. There are seven different federal and provincial studies under way looking at the impact of the roads and mining in the region. Some have been going on since around 2020, and aren’t due to be completed for several more years. After the federal impact-assessment process is completed, permits are typically granted by the government, but there is no standard timeline for their issuance. Mr. Poilievre said Wednesday that his goal is to greenlight all federal permits for the Ring of Fire within six months. Excessive red tape has long been an issue for the Canadian mining industry, but the Ring of Fire has always been a particularly difficult case study. That’s partly because many Indigenous communities are part of the constitutionally mandated consultation process. In one federal regional assessment study under way, 15 First Nations are being consulted. And while some First Nations are open to development, others have rejected it outright, because of the impact mining may have on the environment and traditional hunting grounds.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Mcgee, Niall",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 20, 2025",Infrastructure; Mining industry; Feasibility studies; Funding; Native North Americans; Roads & highways,,2025-03-20,The Globe and Mail
Not welcome on voyage: Poilievre and the media,2025.0,"It is a little bit of a head-scratcher. During a federal election, when you want as many people as possible to hear your plans and policies, Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives are kicking the media off of their campaign buses and aircraft. One of the reasons the CPC cited? The increased costs of travel — and travel is certainly more expensive. The only problem with that explanation is that the media doesn’t take gifts from political parties, including travel — media outlets are billed for their travel costs by the CPC. Still, the CPC says improvements in digital technology mean Poilievre will be open and available, with the party telling media well in advance where Poilievre will be going, and providing digital access to the leader. “We would like to assure you that this campaign will be one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory. We have taken multiple steps to ensure that Canadian media will be able to share any public events, participate in events on the ground, and ask questions remotely and in-person,” Conservative Party national campaign director Jenni Byrne said in a memo to media organizations. But why take away media access that will serve to increase your candidate’s public presence? There are a couple of possible reasons. One may be that Poilievre wants to have less-experienced media covering his campaign positions, so that those positions aren’t as rigorously challenged. The other is that his handlers are afraid that he can’t handle the regular parliamentary press corps without lashing out. After all, the party already has strictly controlled news conferences, limiting the number of questions Poilievre will answer — and who the party will allow to ask them. In one recent news conference, he limited questions to five outlets: True North, Rebel News, Y Media SouthAsianDaily, Oxygen Canada News and Radio-Canada. Only Radio-Canada, the French-language service of the CBC, could be considered mainstream media. It is also, sadly, similar to a page out of the Trump handbook. Donald Trump has been removing experienced media from handling the presidential media pool in favour of “friendly” outlets, claiming a need to better represent digital media. Which is why a reporter from Real America’s Voice network asked the first question of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a high-tension White House meeting — a question about why Zelenskyy wasn’t wearing a suit. The question gave Vice-President JD Vance the perfect opening to lambaste Zelenskyy for not offering up enough performative gratitude to the United States for weapons and other support. The Associated Press, the largest wire service in the U.S., wasn’t even allowed in the room. It’s true that Conservatives aren’t alone in having fractious relationships with the press: Prime Minister Mark Carney had his own run-in with the CBC’s Rosemary Barton in the few days there have been since he became prime minister, and attacking the credibility and motives of the media has become normal political process. But there’s a difference between occasional run-ins between political leaders and the media, and a party leader who makes no effort to hide the disdain he has for reporters. The only question now is whether the move will get Poilievre and the Conservative Party the kind of coverage they want during a federal election campaign, or whether the move will simply and necessarily make coverage of his campaign more difficult — in the process, perhaps limiting Poilievre’s ability to get his message out broadly to the electorate. If you can’t stand the heat, you can throw the cooks out of the kitchen. But don’t count on dinner to work out perfectly.

Opinion: Is Poilievre falling victim to 'Tory Syndrome'?,2025.0,"Polls are now showing that the coming federal election will be a competitive contest This would have been unthinkable at the beginning of the year, when a Léger poll showed the lead extended to an incredible 26-point gap. The expected ballot question will be who Canadians trust to defend Canadian sovereignty from threats of economic ruin and annexation from the Trump administration. The election that Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wished for - running against Justin Trudeau and the carbon tax - has gone the way of the dodo with the arrival of Mark Carney as new Liberal leader and PM. The astonishing surge in Liberal support has, in my estimation, caught the usually highly strategically adept Tory leader flat-footed. How did we get here and what accounts for the struggles of Poilievre to adjust to a new electoral reality? Some answers to the challenges faced by the Conservative party to adapt can be found in The Tory Syndrome by George Perlin, published in 1980. It surveyed leadership politics in the old Progressive Conservative Party, using close analysis of the 1967 and 1976 leadership races to draw out a wider theory of how and why the PCs were doomed to seemingly perennial opposition status. Most importantly, Perlin characterized the titular ""Tory Syndrome"" as self-reinforcing structural defects of factionalism and an ""opposition mentality."" In what he calls, ""minority party syndrome,"" Perlin describes how factionalism has run rife within Conservative parties. ""Electoral defeat contributes to conflict in the party and conflict in the party contributes to its electoral defeats,"" Perlin writes. After Stephen Harper stepped aside as Tory leader in 2015, the various factions within the conservative movement struggled to unify under the leadership of, first, the socially conservative Andrew Scheer and, then, the progressive conservative Erin O'Toole. Both leaders were ultimately defenestrated following election losses in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Since becoming leader in 2022, Poilievre has been unapologetically populist. The party has been unified in lockstep behind this branding, with tight discipline being wielded by the leader's office. Concerned about bleeding votes on its right flank to Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada, which garnered 4.9 per cent of the popular vote in 2021, there was never a widely expected pivot back to the centre to appeal to moderate voters. It appeared that the conventional rules of the game were out the window. Poilievre's continued pugilistic rhetoric appeared to violate the fourth of Paul Wells's rules of politics, which states that ""the candidate who auditions for the role of opposition leader will get the job."" But Poilievre understood the assignment, which was to crest a right-wing populist wave that knocked down multiple incumbent governments across the democratic world in 2024. Then everything changed in 2025: Trudeau has made way for the technocratic former central banker, Carney. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated talk of annexation has reshuffled the political deck in Canada beyond recognition. Voters who previously may have seen Poilievre's invective style as somewhat unseemly but appropriate given the target are re-evaluating. The oft-repeated Tory refrain of the past two years that ""Canada is broken"" - once a clear winning play - is now a desperate liability in a moment of truly momentous patriotic feeling across the country. The comparisons made between the populist style of Poilievre and Trump in paid Liberal attack ads in 2024 felt to me to be tired and desperate. In the new reality of 2025, they are clearly resonating with a significant number of voters. In my view, Poilievre would be well advised to dramatically ostracize the contingent of his party base that still views Trump and his MAGA project positively. I would also counsel him to cleanse his rhetoric of overtly partisan comments that frame the dramatic threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty as the fault of anyone but the administration in Washington. In 1980, Perlin wrote that ""a party which is habitually in opposition becomes absorbed entirely in the strategy and tactics of criticism. It tends to approach all debate with an attacking, destructive style. It therefore appears to lack ideas of its own and projects a negative popular image."" Poilievre's destructive style was the tool for the job when the assignment was to beat up on Trudeau and advocate for a transformation of Canada in line with his small-government populist vision. The Conservatives appear to be held prisoner by the sunken costs of the Trudeau-era attack lines and by the ""opposition mentality"" that defaults toward negative messaging that Canadians may not want in the contemporary moment.

Poilievre says he's a 'tough guy to deal with' in response to Trump criticism,2025.0,"OTTAWA - U.S. President Donald Trump said it is ""easier to deal"" with a Liberal than a Conservative, and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is taking it as a compliment. ""You know what? On that point, it's true,"" said Poilievre, speaking to reporters at a press conference hosted by a construction company in Sudbury, Ont., on Wednesday. ""I'm a strong leader, I'm a tough guy to deal with. I'm firm in my convictions and I'll always put Canada first,"" he added, referring to his latest slogan, ""Canada First,"" which he has been repeating since the start of the U.S. trade war with Canada. Liberal ministers laughed off Trump's comments and downplayed Poilievre's. ""I couldn't care less what Donald Trump wants or thinks in the context of Canadian politics,"" said Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson before a cabinet meeting on Canada-U.S. relations. ""If that's the biggest victory that that Mr. Poilievre thinks that he can get, fair enough."" Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne was surprised to hear the Conservatives refer to themselves as ""tough."" ""Really? I don't know. I've seen them for 10 years, they don't look very tough to me."" Poilievre said it is no wonder that Trump would rather have to deal with a Liberal prime minister instead of him, pointing to how, in his view, Liberals have been blocking energy resource projects, hiking taxes and driving investments to the U.S. in the last nine years. Carney admits to potential conflicts of interest with Brookfield, expects ethics screen to apply A remarkable comeback': Liberals leading Conservatives in exclusive new poll He also pointed to Brookfield Asset Management's decision to move its head office from Toronto to New York, which happened last year during Prime Minister Mark Carney's tenure as chair. The decision happened around the same time as Trump was re-elected for his second term in the U.S. He threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. Pointing to the workers behind him, Poilievre said: ""While these people here were worried about losing their jobs, Mark Carney was busy moving jobs to Trump's hometown. ""That's exactly the kind of weak, compromised, conflicted leadership that Donald Trump wants, and it's why he endorsed Mark Carney yesterday."" Trump did not explicitly endorse Carney during his interview with Fox News. In the interview, which aired Tuesday evening, Trump was asked about the changing polls in Canada that show that Carney's Liberals could form the next government after the next election, overtaking Poilievre's Conservative party, which had enjoyed a comfortable lead for the past 18 months. ""I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,"" Trump said. The U.S. president went on to take a shot at Poilievre, saying that ""the Conservative that's running is, stupidly, no friend of mine."" ""I don't know, but he said negative things. So, when he says negative things, I couldn't care less,"" he said. It is not the first time that Trump has criticized the leader of Canada's Conservatives. In an interview with the Spectator published in February, Trump said that Poilievre's ""biggest problem is he's not a MAGA guy,"" referring to his ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. ""I mean, he's really not, he's not a Trump guy at all,"" Trump added. ""Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA. I am for Canada First. Always,"" Poilievre wrote on X in response. In that same interview, Trump seemingly warned Conservatives, like Poilievre, not to puff their chest so fast. ""They all make that mistake,"" he said. ""They think they're going to be the tough guy and they're going to knock out Trump, and they end up getting the hell beat out of 'em.""

Poilievre promises to fast-track 'Ring of Fire' mining project in northern Ontario,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he would approve all permits to unlock mining in the mineral-rich Ring of Fire area in northern Ontario within six months of his party being elected and commit $1 billion over three years to building roads. Decades of exploration have turned up nickel, copper, chromite, platinum and other metals in the area around the James Bay Lowlands that miners call the Ring of Fire, but the area lacks an all-season road connecting it to the southern portion of Ontario. ""Unlocking the Ring of Fire will be life-changing for northern Ontario towns and First Nation communities, galvanized by thousands of paycheques and modern infrastructure,"" Poilievre said in a release He cast the Ring of Fire as a way to boost the economy and lessen Canada's dependence on China for critical minerals Currently, Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest's Wyloo Metals Ltd. controls the most advanced mine projects in the area, after acquiring Toronto-based Noront Resources Ltd. in 2021 for around $617 million in cash. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has been seeking to advance the project and has pledged to commit up to $1 billion in government funding to build infrastructure in the area. But federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has taken a more circumspect tone, calling it ""a particularly challenging area"" in reference to the geography and the sentiment of some Indigenous communities in the area. ""There is a lot of that area that is peat,"" he said at a press conference in 2022 ""And there are also several Indigenous nations that have raised concerns and certainly questions about development in that space. Both of those issues have to be addressed in any agreement."" The federal government is in the midst of a larger study of the environmental impacts of the proposed roads and projects in the area. In January, it said it had finalized the terms of reference for a regional study. The terms of reference ""set out how the co-led regional assessment will provide information on the impacts of any potential future development"" and regional assessments ""are studies conducted in areas of existing projects or anticipated development,"" it said. The regional assessment is being led by representatives from 15 local Indigenous communities, while the federal impact assessment will look at potential environmental, health, social and economic effects of any future development. Ford, at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada mining convention earlier this month in Toronto, called on the federal government to stop slowing progress on the project Poilievre said he would repeal Bill C-69, the federal bill that overhauled the environmental review process in 2019, which at the time was supported by the Mining Association of Canada. Ring of Fire talks expected between Ottawa, First Nations Ring of Fire stalled due to lack of dialogue with First Nations ""This gatekeeping and red tape was devastating for Canada before Donald Trump threatened tariffs on our economy. Now, it is an act of economic suicide,"" he said. ""By partnering with First Nations to develop our world-class resources, we will bring home powerful paycheques for all Canadians."" .

Bell: If Liberals beat Poilievre all hell will break loose in Alberta,2025.0,"Not again. Say it ain't so. What the heck happened? Hey, this Conservative dude wants to know where the lost and found is so he can try to locate the 25-point lead his party had just a few weeks back. This is straight from the file marked: Are You Kidding Me? Another story from Believe It or Not! Now it is not one poll or two polls, it is many polls They point to a trend and you can't chalk this up to some leftie conspiracy. These are the same number-crunchers who had Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives with a mammoth lead over the Liberals month after month after month. Poilievre and the Conservatives were on their way to a stupendous victory and the Liberals were on the way out, perhaps out of existence. Then former prime minister Justin Trudeau said he was leaving and eventually left. Then U.S. President Donald Trump went after Canada and turned everything upside down in a trade war. And the huge Conservative lead? Gone. Vanished. Just like that. A new Leger poll has the Liberals under their new leader Mark Carney in the lead by three points. In the fine print, the Liberals lead everywhere but the Prairies. There is only one place where more people have a favourable impression than an unfavourable impression of Poilievre. Alberta. An Angus Reid Institute poll has the Liberal lead pegged at five points. Related Pierre Poilievre vows to scrap industrial carbon tax Bell: Premier Smith isn't falling for Carney and his 'new-look' Liberals Now sit down for this news and don't sit anywhere near breakable items easy to throw. When you put all the polls together and come out with a prediction of how many seats each party could win ... well ... life has sure changed in a hurry. Liberals 177 seats. Conservatives 132 seats. The NDP has tanked and is left in the dust. A majority government is 172 seats. Yes, you read it right. 177 is bigger than 172. A possible Liberal majority government. Now these are only polls and when the election is called and the campaign begins in a few days, the numbers could go any which way. Election campaigns matter. That's why we have them, to test the parties out. It is anybody's game. But even the fighting chance of a fourth term for the Liberals seems so surreal. Parliament Hill's West Block, home to the House of Commons. If you live in Alberta, your mind can flash back to the 2019 election. That's the one where the Conservatives were led by Andrew Scheer. Well, Trudeau hung on to a Liberal minority government. If it was up to Alberta, he would have been so gone. In fact, if it was up to Alberta he would never have been prime minister in the first place. Remember the outrage. Right after the election, the Alberta government, then led by former premier Jason Kenney, rolled out a Fair Deal Panel to discuss ways Alberta could get a fair deal within Canada. They held meetings. They produced a report with recommendations. Alberta did not get a fair deal within Canada. Two years later. Another election. The Conservatives were led by Erin O'Toole. Trudeau wins again, another minority government and this time he is propped up by the NDP. Many Albertans were even more pissed off. A THIRD TERM IN OFFICE FOR THE LIBERALS! Of course, if it was up to Alberta the Liberals would have been punted. What followed is more fights with Liberal Ottawa because there are more attacks from Liberal Ottawa. On the provincial scene, Danielle Smith becomes UCP leader and premier vowing to promote Alberta sovereignty within a united Canada. On the federal scene, the Conservatives under Poilievre, the former Calgary Sun newspaper carrier, were looking to finally put a fork in the Liberals. Now we are not so sure. Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's Conservative Party. What will happen if the Liberals win? There was outrage in 2019. There was outrage in 2021. No one cared what Albertans thought or felt.

Politics Insider: Ottawa condemns China’s execution of Canadians:   And Poilievre says Trump’s stated preference for a Liberal government proves the Conservatives are Canada’s best option,2025.0,"Hello, welcome to Politics Insider. Let’s look at what happened today. An unspecified number of Canadians were executed by China earlier this year, Global Affairs Canada confirmed today. In response to an inquiry from The Globe and Mail, which learned about the executions this week, Global Affairs spokeswoman Charlotte MacLeod said Ottawa ""strongly condemns China’s use of the death penalty, which is irreversible and inconsistent with basic human dignity."" ""Canada repeatedly called for clemency for these individuals at the senior-most levels and remains steadfast in its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all cases, everywhere,"" she said. ""We continue to provide consular assistance to the victims’ families."" Meanwhile, Pierre Poilievre says Donald Trump’s stated preference for a Liberal win in the next federal election confirms that the Conservatives are the best option to take on the U.S. President and his aggressive trade policies. The Conservatives have also announced that they will not allow the media to accompany them on their campaign plane in the election, though national campaign director Jenni Byrne said, ""We welcome and encourage participation at all public events."" And, for the first time in three years, Canada’s temporary resident population has declined, after a series of policy changes introduced by Ottawa last year to reduce immigration levels.

"Poilievre says Conservatives would co-fund roads with Ontario into Ring of Fire, speed up development:   The undeveloped land has long been promoted by politicians and some mining companies as holding a treasure trove of mineral riches, but development hasn’t moved forward in nearly two decades",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he’ll commit $1-billion to co-fund roads into Ontario’s Ring of Fire and speed up permitting in the long-stalled mining project located in the province’s far north. The undeveloped Ring of Fire, located 550 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, has long been promoted by politicians and some in the mining industry as holding a treasure trove of mineral riches that are crucial to Canada’s critical minerals ambitions. But despite having multiple owners of the most promising mining assets and several changes of government at both the provincial and federal level, development has never moved forward ever since a junior mining company made a nickel discovery back in 2007. One obstacle has been the lack of basic infrastructure, such as grid power and roads in what is a remote forested region of the province mainly populated by First Nations. If Mr. Poilievre is elected prime minister in the upcoming federal election, and he follows through on his promise to provide the road funding, this would be the first time that both levels of government have agreed on financing a key part of the infrastructure. Ontario has already promised to commit about $1-billion into funding the roads and Premier Doug Ford has long needled the Federal Liberals into committing their share. Three sections of road have been proposed that would connect the Ring of Fire to the provincial highway network, and also connect several First Nations into the road system. The mineral deposits are located about 300 kilometers north of the provincial highway network. For Australia-owned Ring of Fire Metals, which owns the most promising mining assets in the region, the election of Mr. Poilievre would remove a major amount of uncertainty over the economics of the project. ""I can’t think of a period of time in my tenure here, or in the tenure of the project, where we have had as much political support from the provincial perspective, and the potential for developing a federal level of support that is significantly different from the positioning of the current Liberal government,"" said Kristan Straub, the chief executive of Ring of Fire Metals in an interview. Still, other significant barriers remain for the company, including a low nickel price driven by Indonesia oversupply that has caused many western nickel miners to stall or cease their nickel production. Three roads into the Ring of Fire are currently undergoing federal impact assessments, as well as separate provincial assessments. In addition, there is a broader regional assessment underway by the Federal environment ministry aimed at looking at how mining would impact the entire region. As part of those processes, around 15 First Nations are being consulted. Most of the studies have been ongoing since around 2019 or 2020, and aren’t due to be completed for several more years. After completion of the studies, it is up to the government to make a decision. The federal government in its guidelines on the Impact Assessment process says that the government agency typically would take up to 300 days to review an application and at least another 30 days after that to issue its decision. After that process is completed, permits are typically granted by the government but there is no standard timeline for their issuance. Mr. Poilievre said in a Wednesday statement that his goal is to green-light all federal permits for the Ring of Fire ""within six months."" The slow pace of mining regulation in Canada has long been criticized by the mining industry, but the Ring of Fire has always been a particularly difficult project to reach consensus on because there are so many Indigenous communities that are part of the process. And while some are open to development, others have rejected it outright because of the impact mining may have on the environment and traditional hunting grounds. The Ring of Fire is replete with muskeg, which acts as a giant carbon sink. Holding back development in the Ring of Fire has also been the uncertain economics and the relatively small number of discoveries whose economics have been proven. Wyloo’s Eagle’s Nest nickel project is one of the few discoveries where a feasibility study was historically conducted that showed the deposit could be economical to mine. Eagle’s Nest, however, has a short proven mine life of only about 12 years, with the potential to expand that production. By comparison, there are nickel operations in Sudbury that have been in operation for more than 100 years. Ring of Fire Metals is currently conducting a new feasibility study on the project. Mr. Straub said there is no guarantee the company will end up building the mine, as there are so many variables at play. ""I can’t say that we will definitively build the operation,"" said Mr. Straub.

"Trump’s stated preference for a Liberal win shows why Canadians should vote Conservative, Poilievre says:   The Conservative Leader was asked about the U.S. President’s comments on Fox News about a coming Canadian federal election",2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre says Donald Trump’s comments that he would prefer a Liberal win show the Conservatives are the best option to take on the U.S. President. The Conservative leader made the comments at a campaign-style event in Sudbury, Ont., where he was asked about Mr. Trump telling Fox News this week that he thinks it would be easier to deal with Canada if the Liberals won the next federal election. The timing of the next federal election has not yet been announced, but it is widely expected to begin within the next few days. ""It’s clear that President Trump wants the Liberals in power because they will keep this country weak,"" Mr. Poilievre said Wednesday, before saying the Liberal government has a poor record on housing and the economy. He also criticized Mr. Carney over the fact that Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. moved its headquarters from Toronto to New York last year while Mr. Carney was chair of the company. Mr. Carney’s team has previously described the move as technical in nature and that it did not affect the company’s Canadian operations. Mr. Poilievre accused Mr. Carney of ""moving jobs to Trump’s hometown,"" in reference to the transaction. ""That’s exactly the kind of weak, compromised, conflicted leadership that Donald Trump wants, and it’s why he endorsed Mark Carney yesterday. What Canadians need, though, is a leader who’s tough and firm and stands by his convictions. A leader who will make Canada strong, self-reliant and stand on its own two feet, a leader who will put Canada first,"" he said. In an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham that was broadcast Tuesday, Mr. Trump was asked whether his policies and rhetoric against Canada risk hurting the Canadian Conservative Party and will help the Liberals get re-elected. ""The Liberal Party is going to win now in the next election, most likely, and they were down and out,"" said Ms. Ingraham. ""I don’t care,"" Mr. Trump replied. Ms. Ingraham said a Liberal win could make Canada ""more hostile"" to the U.S. and could lead to Canada working more closely with China. ""The conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don’t know him, but he said negative things. So when he says negative things, I couldn’t care less,"" Mr. Trump replied. ""I think it’s easier to deal, actually, with a liberal, and maybe they’re going to win, but I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter to me at all."" Since Mr. Carney was elected Liberal Party leader on March 9 and then was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 14, Mr. Trump had seemed to dial down is comments about taking over Canada as the 51st state. However he repeated that view in the Fox News interview, saying Canada ""pays very little for defence"" and doesn’t respect the United States Mexico Canada Agreement on trade that he signed in his first term. ""USMCA is good, but they cheat. You know, an agreement is good, but they cheat. And Mexico cheats also,"" he said, without providing specific examples. At one point in the interview, Ms. Ingraham challenged Mr. Trump on his stance toward Canada. ""You’re tougher with Canada than you are with some of our biggest adversaries. Why?"" she asked. ""Only because it’s meant to be our 51st state,"" he said, before repeating some of his past criticisms of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his team. Mr. Trump’s comments are at odds with past comments from his close ally, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who is leading the President’s efforts to cut government spending. In a December post on X, the social media platform Mr. Musk owns, he said he agreed ""100″ per cent with a post by U.S. billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who said in a post that Mr. Poilievre ""is extremely impressive. He should be Canada’s next leader. The sooner the better."" Mr. Musk, who has Canadian citizenship through his mother and attended Queen’s University in Kingston, has also praised some of Mr. Poilievre’s videos. Mr. Poilievre did not distance himself from Mr. Musk when he was asked in January, prior to the recent escalation of trade tensions with the United States, whether he accepts Mr. Musk’s endorsement. ""The fact is that it’d be nice if we could convince Mr. Musk to open some factories here in Canada,"" he said. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has accused Mr. Musk of interfering in Canadian democracy. More than 375,000 people have signed an NDP petition calling on on the Prime Minister to revoke Mr. Musk’s Canadian citizenship.

Poilievre is an attack dog. But he’s growling at the wrong target,2025.0,"A moment of silence, please, for the devastating loss that the Conservative Party of Canada still hasn’t fully recognized – or come to terms with. The Tories surely thought they had the coming election in the bag: it would be a carbon-tax election against a deeply unpopular prime minister, after which Pierre Poilievre would form government with a commanding majority. But then Justin Trudeau had to go and resign, and U.S. President Donald Trump had to go play pinball with the Canadian economy, and now Mr. Poilievre’s 25-point lead has become a neck-and-neck race against Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney. Clinging to the corpse of the election he never got to have, Mr. Poilievre announced Monday that the Conservatives will scrap the carbon tax on industry, which is an attempt to draw a line between himself and Mr. Carney, who has reduced the carbon-tax rate to zero for consumers only. Mr. Poilievre stood before a lectern with a sign that read “Axe the Tax,” which one could interpret either as a sign of the Conservatives’ enduring denial, or else, as an example of their non-carbon-tax green initiatives, which evidently includes recycling old campaign signs. For months now, Mr. Poilievre has been trying to fit his old approach into Canada’s new political climate, sort of like a toddler who thinks that if he keeps jamming the triangle shape into the circle hole, it will eventually break through. But no matter how many times Mr. Poilievre says it, Mr. Carney does not come off as “Just Like Justin” the carbon tax has effectively already been axed, and the year is 2025 – not 2024. The campaign the Conservatives thought they would wage is now dead. It’s time for the Conservatives to get a grip, and get over it. To the extent that Mr. Poilievre has managed to pivot, he has simply replaced the name “Justin Trudeau” with “Mark Carney.” Mark Carney will make your life more expensive. Mark Carney is hiding his assets. Mark Carney is out of touch. Mark Carney is sneaky. Mark Carney will make us weaker against U.S. threats. There is logic in trying to brand your opponent before the public really gets to know him (and there is even more logic to sticking to one clear narrative – not five different ones – in trying to establish that brand). But this will be a different type of election – one that is more about an external foe than a battle between domestic leaders. Mr. Poilievre is fundamentally misreading the climate in Canada. Despite his efforts, Canadians don’t see Mr. Carney as the enemy; that’s how they view Mr. Trump. And while Mr. Carney is travelling abroad, trying to strengthen our relationships with foreign allies and fortify our response to U.S. tariffs, Mr. Poilievre is at home complaining about “Carbon Tax Carney” and his supposed plan to continue Mr. Trudeau’s policy agenda. It makes the Conservative Leader look sophomoric and out-oftouch, while Mr. Carney comes off as above-the-fray – a real leader. Mr. Poilievre could shift his tone to start acting more “prime ministerial,” which would mean talking more policy than smack, and also dropping the tired, 2024-era slogans. That might help to regain him some momentum. But the reality is that Mr. Poilievre isn’t “prime ministerial” by nature. His strength is as an attack dog: someone who will go for the jugular and not back down, often channeling the angst and frustrations of the electorate. That’s what defined him as a cabinet member in Stephen Harper’s government, and what fuelled his popularity as Opposition Leader. Canadians were angry about tone-deaf Liberal moralizing at a time when many were struggling to afford groceries, and Mr. Poilievre expertly echoed that. Now they’re angry about Mr. Trump levying punishing tariffs and threatening to make Canada the 51st state – but Mr. Poilievre, noticeably, is not echoing that. He’s directing almost all of his ire at Mr. Carney. During his announcement on Monday, where he was flanked by industrial workers, Mr. Poilievre did offer a few words directly to Mr. Trump. “Why would you go after these people?” he said, pointing to the people behind him. “There is no good reason to do this to these good people. Stop the tariffs, stop the chaos, let’s solve this problem.” The attack dog here suddenly became a poodle, batting a curlyhaired paw at the President. Mr. Poilievre knows how to go hard at an opponent, and he has proven he can tap into the social climate to mirror the energy of the electorate. But he has chosen the wrong target. Canadians are mad at Mr. Trump, not Mr. Carney. Mr. Poilievre, meanwhile, is still mourning the election that never was.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Urback, Robyn",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 19, 2025",Canada-US relations; Political campaigns; Tax rates; Carbon; Prime ministers; Environmental tax; Tax elections; Tariffs,,2025-03-19,The Globe and Mail
"Poilievre bucks tradition, won’t invite media on campaign plane in coming election",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s team has decided that journalists will not be invited to travel on his campaign plane, marking a break from a longstanding practice. Historically, political parties charge media organizations a fee for a seat on the campaign plane, allowing them to cover all of the leader’s events. The start date of the next election has not yet been announced, but it is widely expected to begin within the next few days. Both the Liberal Party and the NDP have sent invitations to media organizations offering the traditional arrangements of places on the leader’s campaign plane or buses for a fee to cover costs. Jenni Byrne, the Conservative Party’s national campaign director, sent an update to media organizations Tuesday afternoon informing them there will be no media contingent on a Conservative bus or plane, “though we welcome and encourage participation at all public events.” Ms. Byrne said in the memo that travel costs have risen at the same time as the capacity for digital and remote access to public events has improved. She also pointed out that in recent years, some national media outlets opted to cover campaigns from their closest bureau rather than participating in the leader’s tour. “We would like to assure you that this campaign will be one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory. We have taken multiple steps to ensure that Canadian media will be able to share any public events, participate in events on the ground, and ask questions remotely and in-person,” she wrote. Ms. Byrne said organizations will be given advance notice of event locations and full conferencing services, “where an equitable balance at all press conferences between local and national media will be ensured.” The campaign says it will also offer a professional-grade video feed for broadcasters. In the 2021 federal election campaign, then-Conservative leader Erin O’Toole did not travel constantly, opting instead to spend a considerable amount of time holding events in an Ottawa studio. However, he had said the studio option was partly about being ready to respond to evolving restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a move away from campaign buses or planes for media at the provincial level. During this year’s Ontario election, none of the major parties offered a full media campaign bus or plane. Carleton University journalism professor emeritus Christopher Waddell, a former Ottawa bureau chief for both CBC News and The Globe and Mail, said he’s not surprised by the announcement. He said there are fewer media organizations that can afford seats on campaign tours. Prof. Waddell said the downside for the media is that they may not know about all of the leader’s events. He also said the Conservatives’ plan would make it easier for the party to decide who asks questions. “There’s no question that if you do this, it gives the party doing it more control,” he said.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 19, 2025",Travel,,2025-03-19,The Globe and Mail
Chris Selley: Mark Carney's showing his weaknesses. But so is Poilievre,2025.0,"Mark Carney had clearly been thinking about becoming prime minister of Canada for quite some time before it happened. To say the least, this wasn't some spur of the moment decision. So, it is some kind of minor mystery that he managed to wander into a press conference in London, England on Monday and come off like a brittle, entitled arriviste Important disclaimer: I am quite certain that your average voter doesn't give a hoot whether politicians are nice to journalists or vice versa, and I'm not suggesting the average voter should. But the two major parties' ongoing media travails speak to much bigger issues. When the Globe and Mail's Stephanie Levitz, one of the most no-nonsense reporters in the parliamentary press gallery, pressed Carney on the timeline for disclosing his assets with respect to the (presumably) forthcoming election, Carney seemed incredulous even to be asked, insisting he was ""following the rules."" ""What possible conflict would (I) have, Stephanie?"" Carney asked. Seriously? The former vice-chair of Brookfield Asset Management, which boasts of ""over US $1 trillion of assets under management""? About which Carney - at the very least - got cute with the truth with respect to the timing of his resignation and the company's headquarters moving to the United States? After our recent experience with very rich men wandering into politics? (Remember Bill Morneau's chateau in France? Morneau apparently didn't) After our recent experience with a considerably less rich man who nevertheless enjoyed the perks of genealogy and office to the tune of a miles-offside vacation on the Aga Khan's private island? The same guy who stood amidst the smouldering wreckage of the Kielburger/WE Charity catastrophe and accused NDP leader Jagmeet Singh of ""cynicism ... in regards to supporting students""? Nope. Anyway, it got worse. When CBC's Rosemary Barton began questioning Carney along the same lines, the prime minister suggested she was bringing ""ill will"" into the discussion and implored her to ""look inside yourself"" to find ... well, presumably evidence of Carney's all-encompassing benevolence. How is it possible that over the months of cogitation and planning and second-guessing, no one screen-tested this guy in a press conference? Mind you, Justin Trudeau was pretty terrible at press conferences too Or just being in public, for that matter. It just took folks a lot longer to realize it. (Remember canoe storage? Or ""Thank you for your contribution""?) And I can't help noticing the Liberals seem to have kept on the same sad-sack social-media team that bombarded users with shameless hypocrisy for the better part of 10 years. You want to cultivate cynicism in Canadian politics? How about setting the consumer carbon tax you've for years been insisting is key to the future of the planet to zero, and then moments later crowing about it on X ""Mark Carney cancelled the carbon tax,"" the Liberals tweeted. So that's what's up with Team Red. Now let's see what's going on with Team Blue. Zoiks. The latest Postmedia-Leger poll has the Conservatives three points behind the Liberals nationwide - 39 to 42 per cent. There is plenty of time for that to change. But as it stands, this seems to be a tie game. Having already rebranded Pierre Poilievre some months back - out with the spectacles, in with form-fitting t-shirts - it's not clear if there's another pivot waiting to happen from the Conservative campaign. They're in a tough spot. Not for any particularly good reason many more Canadians suddenly seem to think that ""Canada is broken"" - which it is, holy cow - is an antipatriotic slur. If these poll numbers don't improve in relatively short order, Poilievre may have trouble keeping the party's rock-solid base happy while trying to reach beyond. The media play a role in that too, and not just from a reportorial standpoint. In recent weeks, against the precedent set by his two predecessors, Poilievre has occasionally picked and chosen the media outlets who get to ask questions at his press conferences - with right-wing and minority-language press generally getting a leg up. Judge that as you see fit. Answering every reporter's question is the way to go, if you ask me, but of course I would say that. Weirder, for a fellow who has otherwise been pretty clear he doesn't think taxpayers should be subsidizing journalism (correct!) Poilievre has been musing about extending financial incentives to conservative outlets in pursuit of a ""depoliticize(d) news media."" On Monday one of those outlets reported a story about Mark Carney's eldest child's medical history in Britain. It didn't even attempt to explain why it would be of any relevance to Canadian voters. It didn't need to. It was about gender transition, and a chunk of the Conservative base is absolutely obsessed with that issue, and so there it was. In a campaign against Justin Trudeau, in a time before Donald Trump's second term, that might not have mattered. The risk for the Conservatives with Carney, uninspiring and entitled as he might be, is that he'll be focused enough on the economy to make these culture-war issues look somewhat frivolous.

"Lorne Gunter: Poilievre Conservatives were unprepared for Trump/Carney ground shift, but it's not too late to get serious",2025.0,"When Justin Trudeau was leader of the Liberal Party, and Donald Trump was just the obnoxious president Canadians were glad was not their country's leader, the Conservative Party's strategy seemed masterful: Do and say as little as possible until an election is called. Leave the Libs alone to self-destruct. But now that Mark Carney has replaced Trudeau, and Donald Trump has started an all-out, unprovoked war on Canada's economy and sovereignty (for reasons known only in the deep recesses of his jumbled mind), Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives' strategy has imploded. Voters in eastern and central Canada have flocked back to the Liberals, apparently unconcerned that the caucus and staffers who brought Canada so much economic and fiscal decline under Trudeau are the very same people now backing Carney. Nothing except the face of the Liberal party has changed. Not their horrendous economic policy, nor their disastrous government spending trajectory, nor their environmental extremism, their taxes, housing policies that have led to a doubling of home prices and rents in under a decade. Not their defence policy nor their strategy for dealing with rising crime nor their immigration targets. Despite all the similarities between the Trudeau Liberals and the Carney Liberals, though, central and eastern Canadians seem to put great faith in the Grits-with-a-new-mask to save us from the Pirate Trump. Good luck with that. If you think what is needed to shield us from Trump's 18th-Century economic foolhardiness is more pipelines, higher industrial productivity, lower corporate taxes to spur investment and deregulation to help bring down consumer prices, don't look to the ""new"" Liberals for any of that. Four months ago, the woke, incompetent, smug Liberals were as much as 23 points behind. However, the latest seat-total projections from the polling analysts at 338Canada.com have the Liberals winning a five-seat majority. Related Lorne Gunter: Hard to imagine a Canada without the Bay Lorne Gunter: Trump to blame if Carney and the Liberals win another election The fault isn't entirely Trump's (although he deserves most of the blame). It is also the fact that the Poilievre Conservatives have failed to pivot from the strategy they devised to defeat Trudeau to a newer, grown-up strategy that reassures voters they are every bit as riled up by Trump (and more capable of besting him) than the Liberals. When Trudeau was Liberal leader, Poilievre didn't have to distance himself from Canada's Enemy No. 1, Donald Trump. It was enough to distance himself from Justin Trudeau. So, he didn't put enough daylight between himself and the U.S. president. And the Conservatives didn't have to give off an air of gravitas befitting a wartime government. Their frat-boy sloganeering was enough to stop the Trudeau Liberals. Now, though, the cutesy alliteration that dominates their ads - ""Carbon tax Carney"" and ""Just like Justin"" - makes them look like sniggering sideline players. Mark Carney is at least as lefty as Trudeau, but he's not as fey in his delivery, which makes him look more formidable in some eyes. Poilievre can be blamed for not responding fast enough to Trump or to Carney's election. Although it is not too late to get serious. For instance, Carney has shown himself to be prickly (and vulnerable) on questions about his ethics and the transparency of his investments. He is not yet an especially skilled campaigner, either. Ontario Premier Doug Ford can be blamed for some of the federal Conservative fall, too, Ford has given Carney not one but two indirect endorsements - a photo-op breakfast between the two and a commitment to work together with the ""very bright"" Liberal PM. The Conservatives have to emphasize Carney's ethics vulnerability and show how far left he is on a host of issues. Pointing out how cosy he is with Beijing wouldn't hurt, either.

Mulcair: Carney vs. Poilievre - an election like no other,2025.0,"Canadians are barrelling toward an early election that Prime Minister Mark Carney will call within the next few days. All of the opposition parties had vowed to defeat the government at the first opportunity, so this election had become inevitable; there was no reason for the Liberals to wait to be defeated on a confidence motion. When you're a party of power, you like to decide things yourself - and the Liberals weren't going to wait to have their fate decided by their opponents. Across the land, there was a pent-up desire for change. It was reflected in a massive Conservative lead that had held until Justin Trudeau's departure. Mark Carney's triumph in the Liberal leadership race to replace Trudeau has, of course, rewritten the script. Will he be able to represent that change and pull off a monumental comeback win for the Liberals? We are about to go through a campaign the likes of which we've never seen: Liberals seeking a fourth mandate while trying to represent change - and Conservatives, stuck in opposition mode, appearing more and more like a flailing force. On the partisan front, the leaders of the two main parties couldn't be more different. In terms of expertise and experience, there's simply no comparing the two main opponents. Carney's professional resume is world class. He's been the governor of the Bank of Canada and was the first ""outsider"" to be the governor of the Bank of England. He's occupied top-level positions at the United Nations, on environment and climate, and in the private sector, in particular with trillion-dollar asset-management firm Brookfield. He has a tendency to speak in the reserved language of a central banker rather than the bold assertions of the seasoned politician, but that's part of the change. His competence helped steer Canada through the deep recession of 2008 and Britain through Brexit. He appears equipped to deal with the irascible blowhard in the White House. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is edgy and hardbitten in his politics and prickly in his dealings with journalists. At the same time, Poilievre's main edge is ... his edginess! He's a pugnacious debater, as he proved when he flattened Jean Charest in a flurry of punches during their leadership contest. His French is fluent and could prove an advantage. Poilievre's biggest challenge is his apparent inability to adapt. His visceral contempt for the Liberals in general and Trudeau in particular was evident in all of their dealings. He is a pit bull who would love to provoke a dogfight with Carney as well, but Canadians have had their fill of belligerence from U.S. President Donald Trump - and Poilievre seems tone deaf to that. Poilievre prosecuted Trudeau brilliantly and his attacks were well-honed and easy for the average Canadian to understand: there was a housing crisis; the country was broke, and the profligate spending had begun well before the pandemic; the cost of living was high and the carbon tax was hurting families. Poilievre vowed to ""axe the tax."" Now even that's been erased by Carney. Trudeau may be gone but Poilievre's contempt hasn't. It's just been redirected to Carney. The day after Carney won the leadership, Poileivre held a press conference filled with partisan and personal bile aimed at Carney. That was the exact wrong tone for a moment when Canadians have had their fill of aggressive posturing from south of the border. Like Trudeau, Poilievre is an excellent politician with little else on his resume. Carney is just the opposite, deeply experienced but untested as a politician. Canadians want change but they also want someone with the ability to help navigate us through these very uncertain times. Who that is will be the ballot question for many Canadians.

Poilievre says he'd repeal carbon price law,2025.0,"O T TA W A Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he will repeal the carbon tax legislation - including the industrial carbon tax - and boost federal tax credits to reward companies that lower emissions. The move comes on the heels of a decision on Friday by new Prime Minister Mark Carney to reduce the price of the consumer carbon tax rate to zero, which means Canadians will no longer pay it on fuels. The legislation for pricing pollution, Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, remains in place. During a press conference in L'Orignal, Que., on Monday, Poilievre said his government would repeal the entire law and scrap both the consumer and industrial carbon pricing schemes. It's the first time he publicly confirmed he would also cut the industrial scheme, known as the output-based pricing system. ""There will be no taxes on consumers, no taxes on Canadian industries. Instead, provinces will continue to have the freedom to address this issue how they like, but there will be no federal obligation to oppose the tax,"" Poilievre said at a lectern adorned with a large ""axe the tax"" sign. The output-based pricing system is a federal backstop program that charges large emitters if they exceed a certain threshold of emissions. It only applies to a handful of provinces and territories (Manitoba, P.E.I, Yukon and Nunavut) as the majority of them have their own systems. In both a video posted to social media and the subsequent press conference, Poilievre accused Carney of planning to hike the carbon tax after the next election. ""Conservative will use technology, not taxes, to protect our environment,"" said Poilievre, in the video. If the party forms government, the Conservative leader promised to expand the clean technology and clean manufacturing investment tax credit to encourage companies to lower emissions. For example, Poilievre argued that cutting taxes on Canadian steel and aluminium production, which emits less carbon than that of other countries such as China, will push those foreign companies to move production here, lowering global emission in the process. ""While the Liberals tax businesses who use energy, Conservatives will cut taxes and boost incentives for those who bring down emissions. Carrot, not stick,"" Poilievre said. ""Cutting taxes on clean production will bring jobs and production home and bring global emissions down,"" he added. Asked if he was prepared to commit Canada to any form of emissions target if he is elected prime minister, Poilievre demurred. ""What would my emissions target look like? I treat this as a global problem. By bringing home production from more polluting foreign jurisdictions, we reduce global emissions while growing our own paycheques,"" he said.

Pierre Poilievre won’t invite media on campaign plane in coming election:   The Liberals and NDP have sent invitations to media organizations offering places on campaign plane or buses for a fee,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s team has decided that journalists will not be invited to travel on his campaign plane, marking a break from a long-standing practice. Historically, political parties charge media organizations a fee for a seat on the campaign plane, allowing them to cover all of the leader’s events. The start date of the next election has not yet been announced, but it is widely expected to begin within the next few days. Both the Liberal Party and the NDP have sent invitations to media organizations offering the traditional arrangements of places on the leader’s campaign plane or buses for a fee to cover costs. Jenni Byrne, the Conservative Party’s national campaign director, sent an update to media organizations Tuesday afternoon informing them that there will be no media contingent on a Conservative bus or plane, ""though we welcome and encourage participation at all public events."" Ms. Byrne said in the memo that travel costs have risen at the same time as the capacity for digital and remote access to public events has improved. She also pointed out that in recent years, some national media outlets opted to cover campaigns from their closest bureau rather than participating in the leader’s tour. ""We would like to assure you that this campaign will be one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory. We have taken multiple steps to ensure that Canadian media will be able to share any public events, participate in events on the ground, and ask questions remotely and in-person,"" she wrote. Ms. Byrne said organizations will be given advance notice of event locations and full conferencing services, ""where an equitable balance at all press conferences between local and national media will be ensured."" The campaign says it will also offer a professional-grade video feed for broadcasters. In the 2021 federal election campaign, then-Conservative leader Erin O’Toole did not travel constantly, opting instead to spend a considerable amount of time holding events in an Ottawa studio. However, he had said the studio option was partly about being ready to respond to evolving restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a move away from campaign buses or planes for media at the provincial level. During this year’s Ontario election, none of the major parties offered a full media campaign bus or plane. Carleton University journalism professor emeritus Christopher Waddell, a former Ottawa bureau chief for both CBC News and The Globe and Mail, said he’s not surprised by the announcement. He said there are fewer media organizations that can afford seats on campaign tours. Prof. Waddell said the downside for the media is that they may not know about all of the leader’s events. He also said the Conservatives’ plan would make it easier for the party to decide who asks questions. ""There’s no question that if you do this, it gives the party doing it more control,"" he said.

"Pierre Poilievre’s strength is as an attack dog. But he’s growling against the wrong target:   Canadians see Donald Trump, not Mark Carney, as the enemy – and the Conservatives need to wake up to that reality ahead of what was once a cakewalk election",2025.0,"A moment of silence, please, for the devastating loss that the Conservative Party of Canada still hasn’t fully recognized – or come to terms with. The Tories surely thought they had the coming election in the bag: it would be a carbon-tax election against a deeply unpopular prime minister, after which Pierre Poilievre would form government with a commanding majority. But then Justin Trudeau had to go and resign, and U.S. President Donald Trump had to go play pinball with the Canadian economy, and now Mr. Poilievre’s 25-point lead has become a neck-and-neck race against Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney. Clinging to the corpse of the election he never got to have, Mr. Poilievre announced Monday that the Conservatives will scrap the carbon tax on industry, which is an attempt to draw a line between himself and Mr. Carney, who has reduced the carbon-tax rate to zero for consumers only. Mr. Poilievre stood before a lectern with a sign that read ""Axe the Tax,"" which one could interpret either as a sign of the Conservatives’ enduring denial, or else, as an example of their non-carbon-tax green initiatives, which evidently includes recycling old campaign signs. For months now, Mr. Poilievre has been trying to fit his old approach into Canada’s new political climate, sort of like a toddler who thinks that if he keeps jamming the triangle shape into the circle hole, it will eventually break through. But no matter how many times Mr. Poilievre says it, Mr. Carney does not come off as ""Just Like Justin""; the carbon tax has effectively already been axed, and the year is 2025 – not 2024. The campaign the Conservatives thought they would wage is now dead. It’s time for the Conservatives to get a grip, and get over it. To the extent that Mr. Poilievre has managed to pivot, he has simply replaced the name ""Justin Trudeau"" with ""Mark Carney."" Mark Carney will make your life more expensive. Mark Carney is hiding his assets. Mark Carney is out of touch. Mark Carney is sneaky. Mark Carney will make us weaker against U.S. threats. There is logic in trying to brand your opponent before the public really gets to know him (and there is even more logic to sticking to one clear narrative – not five different ones – in trying to establish that brand). But this will be a different type of election – one that is more about an external foe than a battle between domestic leaders. Mr. Poilievre is fundamentally misreading the climate in Canada. Despite his efforts, Canadians don’t see Mr. Carney as the enemy; that’s how they view Mr. Trump. And while Mr. Carney is travelling abroad, trying to strengthen our relationships with foreign allies and fortify our response to U.S. tariffs, Mr. Poilievre is at home complaining about ""Carbon Tax Carney"" and his supposed plan to continue Mr. Trudeau’s policy agenda. It makes the Conservative Leader look sophomoric and out-of-touch, while Mr. Carney comes off as above-the-fray – a real leader. Mr. Poilievre could shift his tone to start acting more ""prime ministerial,"" which would mean talking more policy than smack, and also dropping the tired, 2024-era slogans. That might help to regain him some momentum. But the reality is that Mr. Poilievre isn’t ""prime ministerial"" by nature. His strength is as an attack dog: someone who will go for the jugular and not back down, often channeling the angst and frustrations of the electorate. That’s what defined him as a cabinet member in Stephen Harper’s government, and what fuelled his popularity as Opposition Leader. Canadians were angry about tone-deaf Liberal moralizing at a time when many were struggling to afford groceries, and Mr. Poilievre expertly echoed that. Now they’re angry about Mr. Trump levying punishing tariffs and threatening to make Canada the 51st state – but Mr. Poilievre, noticeably, is not echoing that. He’s directing almost all of his ire at Mr. Carney. During his announcement on Monday, where he was flanked by industrial workers, Mr. Poilievre did offer a few words directly to Mr. Trump. ""Why would you go after these people?"" he said, pointing to the people behind him. ""There is no good reason to do this to these good people. Stop the tariffs, stop the chaos, let’s solve this problem."" The attack dog here suddenly became a poodle, batting a curly-haired paw at the President. Mr. Poilievre knows how to go hard at an opponent, and he has proven he can tap into the social climate to mirror the energy of the electorate. But he has chosen the wrong target. Canadians are mad at Mr. Trump, not Mr. Carney. Mr. Poilievre, meanwhile, is still mourning the election that never was.

Poilievre vows to scrap industrial levy:   Conservative leader pledges to go further than Carney who had discontinued consumer charge,2025.0,"The political retreat from national carbon pricing gathered pace on Monday, when Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre vowed to go further than his political opponents by dismantling the entire federal regime that imposes a cost on greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. The pledge amounted to a one-up on Prime Minister Mark Carney, who just days ago - in one of his first acts in office - ditched the consumer carbon price that Poilievre has long lampooned as a tax that is driving up costs. But it wasn't until Monday that Poilievre cleared long-standing ambiguity over his own plans, promising not only to ""axe the tax"" on consumers, but to also scrap the federal government's industrial pricing scheme. ""We will also axe the tax on steel, aluminum, natural gas, food production, concrete and other industries instead of taxes,"" Poilievre said, referring to the current requirement under a 2019 law for all provinces and territories to have minimum carbon prices on heavy emitting industries. ""We will use technology. Technology, not taxes, is the best way to fight climate change and protect our environment,"" he said. The promise immediately raised questions about whether the Conservatives could maintain Canada's current international commitments to slash emissions that cause climate change. According to the Canadian Climate Institute, industrial carbon pricing is expected to account for almost half of the country's projected emissions reductions by 2030, when the current government aims to slash greenhouse gas output by at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels. Poilievre's announcement also sparked criticism from other federal parties, and environmental groups who accused the Conservatives of caving to corporate interests. In place of national carbon pricing, Poilievre promised to expand existing tax credits for clean technology and investments in clean manufacturing in a ""carrot, not stick"" approach. He did not specify how much he would expand these credits, which the current government expects to cost $11.4 billion over five years, or how much they would reduce emissions. Poilievre also dodged a question about whether he would have a target for national emissions reductions, stating he would view climate change as a global problem and that Canada could help cut global emissions if it exports more natural gas that displaces dirtier fuel. ""I don't think it is an achievement to shut down a Canadian steel mill ... and then see one open up in China that produces 10 or 20 times more emissions for each unit of steel. (What) we need to do is acknowledge that the best way to reduce emissions is to bring home clean production here,"" Poilievre said. Poilievre's spokesperson, Sebastian Skamski, did not respond when asked if the Conservatives would stay in the international Paris Agreement, which is based on countries adhering to national emissions targets to avoid the catastrophic extremes of climate change. He also did not say how much it would cost for Poilievre to expand the tax credits, or whether the hit to government revenue would be matched with cuts under his ""dollar-for-dollar"" promise to match new spending with equivalent reductions. In an interview with the Star, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson described Poilievre's emphasis on technological incentives over taxes as ""garbage,"" and argued the Conservative leader doesn't understand the need for both ""carrots"" and ""sticks"" to spur economic growth and reduce emissions. Wilkinson argued it is bad economic and environmental policy to scrap industrial carbon pricing, a walk-back on climate action that is ""aping"" what Trump is doing in the United States, which has included withdrawing from the Paris Accord and promising to crank up fossil fuel production. The Conservatives have also promised to repeal the Trudeau-era Impact Assessment Act, which they allege is failing to clear the way for major development projects, including fossil fuel pipelines. The party also opposes the Liberal government's planned emissions cap for the oil and gas sector, and clean fuel regulations that Poilievre has described as a second ""carbon tax."" ""This shows us that Mr. Poilievre never had an intention to address climate change, and he feels emboldened by President Trump,"" Wilkinson said of Monday's pledge to get rid of the national requirement for industrial pricing. At a news conference, Poilievre also alluded to Trump in arguing that Liberal policies like the industrial carbon price have weakened the Canadian economy and left the vulnerable to Trump's tariffs and threats of annexation. ""The combination of Trump's tariffs and Carney's would be a disaster for the workers behind me. Workers would lose wages, consumers would pay more money, and jobs would leave Canada, making us even more dependent on the Americans, just like Trump wants,"" Poilievre said.

"Poilievre vows to scrap industrial carbon levy:   Under Conservative plan, provinces would have freedom to address emissions however they choose",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he would scrap the carbon levy on industrial emitters as well as the consumer carbon levy. Mr. Poilievre said that if his party is victorious in the coming federal election, his government would repeal the entire carbonpricing law, including the levy on Canadian industries. This means there would not be a levy on Canadian steel, aluminum, food production, concrete and other industries, he said. “There would be no taxes on consumers, no taxes on Canadian industries. Instead, provinces will continue to have the freedom to address this issue how they like, but there will be no federal obligation to impose the tax,” Mr. Poilievre told reporters at a steel wire manufacturing plant in L’Orignal, Ont. Consumer carbon pricing was shaping up to be the central campaign issue for the Conservatives before Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged during the Liberal leadership race to do away with it and the focus shifted to U.S. President Donald Trump’s America First trade agenda and threats to annex Canada. Mr. Carney reduced the consumer levy to zero on Friday and promised to repeal the law that applies to consumers if the Liberals win an election expected to be called by Sunday. He would have had to recall Parliament to repeal the section of the law dealing with consumer carbon pricing but would likely have faced a non-confidence vote and certain defeat. The opposition parties vowed to defeat the Liberals if the House of Commons came back from prorogation on March 24. Mr. Carney had said, while running for the leadership, that he would increase the levy on big industrial emitters, but he provided few details. He has also said a Carney-led government would impose a carbon border adjustment tariff on high-polluting foreign imports, based on greenhouse gases emitted during production. In London, where he met King Charles III and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Mr. Carney told reporters that he intends to impose a more efficient system so that the largest polluters can receive carbon credits on top of the carbon border tariff. He noted the European Union will also be imposing its own carbon border tariffs starting next year, which means Canadian exports would be subject to a carbon price without the benefit of Canada receiving the money. To diversify trade to Europe and Asia, Canada must have a price on carbon, he said. “It is a system that recognizes the new trading reality,” he said. “We are able to go out and help Canadian companies prepare.” Mr. Poilievre has said that industrial carbon pricing hurts industries such as steel and aluminum, which have already been hit by Mr. Trump’s 25-per-cent tariff, and 10 per cent on energy, potash and critical mineral imports. “The combination of Trump’s tariffs and Carney’s carbon taxes would be a disaster for Canadian workers,” he said. The Conservative Leader said he would use technology and tax incentives to encourage heavy industries to make products with lower emissions. He vowed to build more natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities for export to destinations in Europe and Asia, which would help reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions while getting world prices for Canadian energy. “I don’t think it is an achievement to shut down a Canadian steel mill and then see one open up in China that produces 10 or 20 times more emissions for each unit of steel,” he said. Mr. Poilievre’s scrapping of the federal policy would not necessarily end industrial pricing across Canada. As of now, all provinces except for Manitoba and Prince Edward Island have their own such systems in place. In a joint statement, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and Environment Minister Rebecca Schulz said that Ottawa imposes “onerous standards and requirements,” and that the Alberta government supports “Pierre Poilievre’s commitment to return jurisdictional authority back to the provinces to regulate their own industrial emissions.” Grace Lee, a spokesperson for Ontario Premier Doug Ford, said in a statement that given the U.S. tariffs, “all levels of government need to look for ways to lower costs, support people and businesses, and make us more economically competitive.” Ewan Sauves, a spokesperson for Quebec Premier François Legault, said the province has a carbon market system that works in Quebec, and would not comment on any positions taken by federal parties in the next election. University of Ottawa law professor Stewart Elgie, who is chair of sustainable prosperity at the U of O’s Institute of the Environment, said greenhouse gas emissions will increase by about 10 per cent by 2030 if industrial carbon pricing is eliminated. “That’s equivalent to doubling the number of cars and passenger trucks on the road,” he said. “That’s equivalent to doubling the emissions from British Columbia or Saskatchewan. It’s a big increase.” Economist Chris Ragan, who chaired Canada’s Ecofiscal Commission and is an associate professor at McGill University’s Max Bell School of Public Policy, said industrial carbon pricing is effective and designed to ensure competitiveness. It has not generated public antipathy like the consumer carbon levy, he said. “So, if he’s going to eliminate this, then what is he going to replace it with? And my fear is that he will end up either replacing it with nothing or replacing it with something that is a much highercost policy,” he said.

Pierre Poilievre vows to scrap industrial carbon tax,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he will repeal the carbon tax legislation - including the industrial carbon tax - and boost federal tax credits to reward companies that lower emissions.

"Pierre Poilievre wants to axe the tax, even if it is the wrong one:   Conservative Leader tried to tie his new position to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war by arguing it will hurt the competitiveness of Canadian industry",2025.0,"The signs still work. Phew. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre put a lot of work into that ""axe the tax"" slogan, and there was no way he wanted to waste a rhyme. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced after he was sworn in on Friday that he would kill the federal fuel charge – the consumer carbon levy that has raised so many seething complaints. So you might think that ""axe the tax"" slogan would be destined for the trash heap. Not so. On Monday, Mr. Poilievre moved quickly to promise he would axe another carbon levy: the industrial carbon levy, also known as the Output Based Pricing System. It’s not quite as edgy to axe this particular tax because not many people know it even exists, it doesn’t collect a lot of money and it hasn’t attracted the same kind of vitriolic political angst as the consumer levy. It’s also the low-cost way to reduce emissions. Searching for a tax to axe, Mr. Poilievre picked the wrong one. Oh well. Facing a new opponent, he rushed to react. For two years, the Conservative Leader steadfastly refused to say whether he would also kill the industrial carbon-price program. But Mr. Poilievre had promised a ""carbon tax election"" nearly every day for a long, long time, so by golly he wasn’t going to let Mr. Carney kill that dream. It wasn’t really a last-minute decision. The Conservatives decided months ago they’d propose to cancel the industrial carbon price so voters would not think they were anything but 100 per cent against carbon levies. By the time it was announced, it looked like Mr. Poilievre was just trying to one-up Mr. Carney. The Conservative Leader did try to tie his new position to the new dominant issue – U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war – by arguing it will hurt the competitiveness of Canadian industry. At a Monday press conference at Ivaco Rolling Mills in l’Orignal, Ont., Mr. Poilievre insisted steel and aluminum companies will be clobbered if they pay the industrial carbon price alongside Mr. Trump’s 25-per-cent tariff on aluminum and steel. But the proportions are vastly different. The tariffs are big. The industrial carbon price is small – unless you are an unusually big polluter compared with others in the same sector. Certainly, companies hit by tariffs could be helped by any kind of tax reduction, but not just carbon levies. Industrial carbon pricing does most of the heavy lifting in emissions reductions, but because of the way it is structured, it doesn’t cost industry a lot of cash. On oil, it’s about 30 cents on a barrel that on average brings in a $40 profit, according to Dave Sawyer, the principal economist at the Canadian Climate Institute. Most provinces have their own version; only Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and Nunavut use the federal system. Generally, the pricing systems set an emissions target for large polluters in a sector. A company with high emissions pays a price per tonne, and a company with low emissions earns a credit they can sell. Companies don’t pay the price on all their emissions, only the emissions that exceed a set bar, so the total cost is kept down. And emitters can buy credits at a pretty low price. Those credits provide incentives to reduce emissions. And according to Mr. Sawyer, Alberta companies are sitting on about $5-billion worth, which presumably would disappear with the industrial carbon price. Of course, the Conservatives can still scrap the whole business. Public zeal for reducing emissions has fallen. Mr. Poilievre indicated on Monday that he has no interest in setting a target for cutting Canada’s emissions. Mr. Carney, at a Monday press conference in London after his meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, argued that Mr. Poilievre’s proposal is short-sighted at a time when Canada is seeking to diversify its trade beyond the U.S. He noted that the European Union already has a border carbon tariff on goods, and that industrial pricing mitigates the cost. That kind of wonkery won’t be the big issue in the imminent federal election campaign, anyway. Climate change won’t be either. Yet the Conservatives know some people will remain angry about the consumer carbon levy even after it is gone. Now they can still use the signs.

"Poilievre says he’ll scrap carbon levy on industrial emitters and consumers if elected:   Conservative leader says there would not be a levy on Canadian steel, aluminum, food production, concrete and other industries",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he will scrap the carbon levy on industrial emitters as well as the consumer carbon levy. In video statement released Monday, Mr. Poilievre says if elected to govern in the upcoming election, his government would repeal the entire carbon price law, including the tax on Canadian businesses and industries. This means there would not be a levy on Canadian steel, aluminum, food production, concrete and other industries, he said. Prime Minister Mark Carney reduced the consumer levy to zero on Friday and promised to repeal the law that applies to consumers if elected in an election expected to be called by Sunday. He would have had to recall Parliament to repeal the section of the law dealing with consumer carbon pricing but would likely have faced a non confidence vote and certain defeat. The opposition parties vowed to defeat the Liberals if the House of Commons was recalled on March 24. Mr. Carney has said he would increase the levy on big industrial emitters while running for the Liberal leadership but provided few details. Mr. Poilievre has said the industrial carbon levy hurts industries such as steel and aluminum that have already been hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25-per-cent tariff. The Conservative leader will hold a news conference later this morning to discuss his plan to repeal the entire carbon price law enacted by the former Justin Trudeau government.

Ford-Carney alliance shuns Poilievre,2025.0,"Power breakfasts aren't on the menu at Wally's Grill most days. The Etobicoke diner does scrambled eggs for everyday folks. It rarely unscrambles big problems for big politicians. So when Doug Ford sat down last week with Mark Carney, he set the table for an unlikely alliance: Canada's most powerful Tory and the country's most powerful Liberal getting together to start a new day. Ontario's three-term premier invited Canada's zero-term prime minister (just ahead of Friday's swearing-in and the coming election campaign) for a face-to-face and heart-to-heart. Now they are shoulder to shoulder. The photo-op - snapped by Ford's official photographer and helpfully distributed to the media for publication - tells the story of an old pol and his new pal comparing notes. But there's something wrong with this picture that raises an awkward question: Guess who's not coming to breakfast - not anytime soon? Answer: Pierre Poilievre - the man who would be prime minister, leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. Missing from the photo and missing in action. Never invited to see and be seen (or photographed) with Ford, whether at Wally's or anywhere else. Not for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Not even coffee. By contrast, Carney joins the club of Liberals who are part of Ford's circle of erstwhile adversaries who are now earnest advisers. That collection of cabinet ministers and prime ministers includes Dominic LeBlanc, Chrystia Freeland, François-Philippe Champagne, Justin Trudeau and now Carney. They are trusted phone pals of the premier, discussing consequential matters of state and confidential questions of political stagecraft. Of course, Ford's phone circle is far from exclusive, given that he shares his mobile number publicly and has taken tens of thousands of calls since becoming premier in 2018. He'll take a call from just about anyone. Just not yet Poilievre - who didn't even bother to congratulate Ford's Tories on last month's election triumph. What's keeping them apart? After all, they are fellow travellers and forever Tories, equal parts populist and anti-elitist. By rights, these two right-wingers should be soulmates. Yet they are on entirely different wavelengths. Ford has evolved into a people-pleasing populist who craves popularity, which means expanding Ontario's Tory base into a broader pool of voters. The premier thinks of his provincial Progressive Conservatives and the federal Liberals through the frame of a Venn diagram with converging areas of support. He understands that his supporters also voted for Trudeau and may now for Carney, so he watches his words and eyes their images. After all, Ford's own riding of Etobicoke North is one of the safest federal seats in Ontario. Carney came to kiss the ring at Wally's because he, too, understands the virtue of Venn diagrams. Poilievre doesn't do rings, or Wally's or Venn diagrams. Poilievre is a disruptive populist who pokes and prods. He has embraced anti-elitism with a vengeance, hence his venomous attacks on Carney as he tries to cut the former central banker's formidable CV down to size. Canada is famous for its tall poppy syndrome - where people lop off those who rise above the rest. He plans to decapitate Carney. Ford takes a different tack. The premier never completed college, but his three majority election victories suggest he knows a thing or two about political science. He once disparaged the elites but now takes advice from them. All that changed after the pandemic changed him, because as COVID peaked, Ford was on the phone regularly with top scientists and hospital CEOs. Ever since, he has taken advice from the smartest civil servants and political operatives. Now, as the economy tanks, the premier talks all the time with some of the savviest corporate CEOs - many of whom Poilievre disdains and distances himself from. Perhaps that's why Ford views only Carney's good side, while Poilievre sees only his dark side. After breakfast together, Ford's verdict was unlike anything you'd ever hear the federal Conservative leader say: ""I can tell you one thing, Mark Carney (has an) extremely astute business mind - he understands numbers,"" Ford mused. Ford observed that U.S. President Donald Trump kept mocking Trudeau as prime minister, but might now turn the page with Carney because of the very resume that Poilievre belittles: ""I think they're going to get along very well - they both come from the same financial sectors,"" the premier said pointedly to reporters. Ford has never paid Poilievre a similar compliment, possibly because the federal opposition leader has no business experience (as Ford does) before becoming a career politician. Tellingly, shortly after tutoring the federal Liberal leader in retail politics and praising his smarts, Ford took a vow of silence for the coming campaign. Enough said. Point made.

Stephen Harper's memory is not selective,2025.0,"Re: ""In 2011, Harper said Carney was right choice,"" letter, March 13. The letter said former Prime Minister Stephen Harper has a short memory because he praised Mark Carney's skills in a letter to the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2011, but he also criticized Carney for taking too much credit for Canada's financial performance in the 2008 financial crisis. I don't see that there is any contradiction in the two statements. Carney as governor of the Bank of Canada undoubtedly conducted the affairs of the bank appropriately in 2008. Harper acknowledged that in 2011 in his letter to the FSB. However, in the Liberal leadership debate, Carney indicated that it was his leadership that guided Canada successfully through those perilous times. Harper rightly pointed out that the tough decisions were made by finance minister Jim Flaherty. No doubt, Carney played a role, but the credit for our superior navigation of the financial crisis at that time goes mostly to Flaherty. Stephen Harper does not have a short memory and, most importantly, he doesn't have selective memory.","Times - Colonist; Victoria, B.C.","Victoria, B.C.","Dale, Dennis",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 15, 2025",Economic crisis,,2025-03-15,Times - Colonist

"The office, an election and the world are rushing at Mark Carney like no rookie PM before:   Protected in a quick Liberal leadership campaign, Mr. Carney faces hard knocks on the hu stings, notably from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre",2025.0,"Last Saturday, the Liberal Party had an election-campaign plane with no name on the side: A new leader hadn’t been chosen. Today, Mark Carney is Prime Minister. Next weekend, he will probably be running for office for the first time. There have been unelected prime ministers without a seat in the House of Commons before, but he’s the first who has never been elected. Few new prime ministers launched election campaigns as quickly as he intends. And it will come in the heat of a trade war with a U.S. President who threatens tariffs, or pauses them, between social-media posts about annexing Canada. The unpredictable future is rushing fast at Canada. And at Mr. Carney. The smaller, 24-member cabinet Mr. Carney named as he was sworn in at Rideau Hall on Friday was supposed to symbolize more focus, and all action. By the end of the day, he would kill the unpopular consumer carbon levy. ""The moment is a moment of crisis,"" Mr. Carney said. But he’s never done this before – not just being PM, but campaigning in an election, let alone amid a trade war. He was bubble-wrapped and protected in a soft, quick Liberal leadership campaign. Now, he faces hard knocks on the hustings, notably from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Canadians have never done this before – not just choosing a government in a snap election expected to be called by a rookie-politician Prime Minister. They will do so in a crisis that raises the bigger prospect that the comfortable platform on which the country has sat – once it was the British Empire and more recently partnership with the U.S. in a cohesive, democratic ""West"" – might be burning. In 1890, the U.S. passed the steep McKinley tariff that some leading Republicans hoped would press Canada to become the 45th state. Sir John A. MacDonald used it as a platform for his last campaign in 1891 – but he ran on Canada’s own existing tariffs while trade with the U.S. shifted back to the British Empire. A lot has changed. This new Prime Minister had five days for transition briefings, choosing a cabinet, taking power, and setting an initial course for dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump – as well as breakfast with Ontario Premier Doug Ford and an awkward hard-hat photo op at a Hamilton steel mill. He has another week to finalize a platform and campaign plan being put together for an election that mere weeks ago the Liberals were sure to lose. Now, it’s close. Surging anxiety about Mr. Trump’s tariffs made the economic crisis-management experience of the former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor look reassuring. But underneath, the frustrations about the cost of living and deep-rooted desire for change that had made Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives the front runners for two years are still palpable. There are two approaches to governing in a Trump crisis: Mr. Carney promises reassuring crisis management and making government work again, while Mr. Poilievre promises to sweep away ""broken"" swaths of government and big tax cuts, including as an immediate response to the trade war. Mr. Poilievre has notched up attacks on Mr. Trump for ""betraying"" Canada, and argued that Liberal taxes would be compounded by Trump tariffs. A torrent of events in Canadian politics was set off just over two months ago by Justin Trudeau’s reluctant, belated, announcement that he would resign, but Mr. Trump has made it a deluge. On Wednesday, Liberal strategists were still trying to plot out plans for the days between Mr. Carney’s swearing-in and the launch of the election campaign. By Friday, he was announcing his first foreign trip to London and Paris. There was, in the swearing-in of his government, some studied symbols of a change in style from Mr. Trudeau. A handshake and a hand on the elbow for newly-sworn ministers, not a hug. Elements of tradition, in a speech that referred to three founding peoples and the Crown. Some curt answers at a news conference. And a phrase borrowed from Stephen Harper, circa 2006 – Canada’s new government. Most of the ministers were familiar faces from Mr. Trudeau’s government, however, albeit some in switched roles – and Conservatives quickly derided the same-old Liberals. Mr. Carney did cool down the confrontational tone about Mr. Trump from his leadership-campaign victory speech, calling the suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state ""crazy"" but noting that he respects Mr. Trump. ""He knows, and I know from long experience that we can find mutual solutions that win for both."" But right now, Mr. Carney has an unusual, temporary term. In perhaps a week, the Prime Minister will morph to campaigning candidate, governed by a caretaker convention that is supposed to leave most governing to routine business handled by civil servants. Typically, a skeleton staff is left in the Prime Minister’s Office in case anything unusual comes up. In the 2015 election campaign, it was Conservative staffer Howard Anglin who was left behind to check in with senior officials in the Privy Council Office. ""The main thing that came up was the signing of the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] treaty,"" Mr. Anglin said. That had been anticipated, and officials agreed it could be signed despite the caretaker convention ""because the limited window to sign on ended before the election,"" he said. But Mr. Carney would be expected not to start and conclude some entirely new trade-treaty negotiation, for example. He shouldn’t dole out new spending. Yet he will almost certainly have to do an unusual amount of governing – responding to new tariffs, and directly or indirectly talking, or negotiating, with Mr. Trump’s White House. One of the messages that then-finance minister Dominic LeBlanc carried to his Thursday meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was that Canada is going into an election campaign, providing a possibility of a reset with a new government – and the administration could cool its rhetoric. But who can keep Mr. Trump quiet for six weeks? By Canadian standards, Mr. Carney’s transition to power was rapid, five days compared with the usual two or three weeks. It usually means long days of hammering out a legislative agenda and sequencing plans over years. Mr. Carney’s rushed transition – headed by Janice Charette, a former clerk of the Privy Council and head of the civil service, working with the current clerk, John Hannaford – had one advantage: He can plot out the next four months instead of four years. ""He can be very, very focused on the Canada-U.S. chessboard and almost everything else could be put aside,"" Michael Wernick, another former Privy Council clerk who authored Governing Canada: A Guide to the Tradecraft of Politics . ""That’s what makes it unique."" Mr. Carney’s transition had to focus on campaign plans, even though Liberal Party officials appointed by Mr. Trudeau had already done some of that work ahead of time. The slogan Mr. Carney unveiled last Sunday – ""Canada Strong"" – had already been market-tested by the party, along with others proposed by other leadership candidates. Draft election-platform documents included options for a new leader. Members of Mr. Carney’s leadership team have joined the national campaign already headed by Andrew Bevan. In some ways, Mr. Carney has more experience than most. He was associate deputy minister of finance, organizing budgets and coping with the early ripples of financial crisis that became his focus after he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada in 2008. He sat in meetings with G7 and G20 central bankers and had a global role after becoming chair of the international Financial Stability Board in 2011, and was seen as a global central-banking star before he moved to head the Bank of England in 2013. The CV is one of the few things most Canadians know about Mr. Carney – the crisis-manager experience that has been his biggest political asset. The other thing they might have heard is Mr. Carney’s mantra that ""plan beats no plan,"" a phrase he picked up from then-U.S. treasury secretary Timothy Geithner during the 2008 financial crisis. In his 2020 book, Value(s) , Mr. Carney made clear in a section on leadership that that means having a plan that’s ready to execute – not ""searching endlessly for the best."" He was known in those posts as a demanding manager sometimes withering in judgment, who expected people to speak up. ""He’ll go around the table. He’ll call on you,"" said Evan Siddall, a long-time friend who worked with him at the Bank of Canada. ""Cabinet meetings will be real debates of real issues."" This is electoral politics. There won’t be much time for debates. Mr. Carney is a political leader, and his job now will be campaigning on his platform – while he deals with Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump is the issue. A Nanos Research poll found that the President’s trade war has made two-thirds of Canadians feel anxious for the future. More than 30 per cent are avoiding news, 22 per cent are feeling financial stress, and 12.5 per cent report trouble sleeping. ""It is the equivalent of the shock and anxiety of the global pandemic,"" said pollster Nik Nanos. Canadian prime ministers have faced other anxious moments, of course, including the close vote for Quebec separation in 1995, and two world wars. Mr. Trudeau coped with Mr. Trump’s erratic threats to tear up the North American free-trade agreement in the President’s first term. This is not the same. ""In the first term, they wanted a bit of our dairy industry. Now, they want everything,"" said Eurasia Group vice-chair Gerald Butts, Mr. Trudeau’s principal secretary from 2015 to 2019, who has been offering advice to Mr. Carney. Mr. Trump now talks about renegotiating water treaties, and calls the border an arbitrary line. In his first term, he often used the 51st-state gibe in private with Mr. Trudeau, but back then, Mr. Butts said, his aides could go to members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet and warn that it was politically radioactive in Canada: ""If he ever says this in public, the NAFTA negotiations would end right away. Because we couldn’t talk to you any more."" ""Now, there are no guardrails,"" Mr. Butts said. ""That’s a big difference."" Not just that: Mr. Trump has raised doubts about security alliances, intelligence co-operation, and the geopolitical lines on which the world turned for decades. The defence and security briefings that Mr. Carney received this past week would be vastly different from those Mr. Trudeau was given in 2015. In recent days, there wasn’t really a substantive trade negotiation taking place between the White House and Mr. Trudeau’s government. There were tariffs and countertariffs, threats, pauses and reversals. Mr. Trump’s next set of tariffs are so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs that are slated to be imposed April 2 – he has mused about punishing Canada for supply-managed dairy, Canada’s digital-services tax and ridiculously, the GST. Mr. Carney would have to respond, presumably with retaliatory tariffs – and perhaps a comeback to a presidential social-media post. Politics will demand that the PM with a ""Canada Strong"" slogan hang tough. But normally, a new prime minister faced with a trade war would be working the White House. ""You have to figure out a way to develop a relationship, and you need to unearth their intent and what the best-case scenario is against the challenge you’re presented,"" said Bill Morneau, the finance minister from 2015-2020. Mr. Morneau is a big believer in Mr. Carney’s abilities. ""But it’s not going to be easy."" It’s not the only thing. Conservatives have tried to punch a few holes in Mr. Carney’s central-banker résumé – Mr. Poilievre retweeted a British article blaming Mr. Carney for the inflation rate 30 months after he left the Bank of England. But the Tories won’t beat Mr. Carney on whether the former banker can manage a crisis, but perhaps on whether he can manage it for the benefit of ordinary folks. Mr. Carney’s involvement in the decision to move the headquarters of a company of which he was chair, Brookfield Asset Management, from Toronto to New York, will be embarrassing baggage – Mr. Poilievre accused him of putting himself, not Canadians, first. And voters seem to want fight as much as acumen. ""I think people want champions to embody that fight,"" said Kory Teneycke, the campaign manager for Ontario Premier Doug Ford in the election that the Premier won by a landslide in February. Three months ago, the biggest issue in the country was frustration with Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Teneycke said. The second biggest was the carbon tax. Both have been blunted. The biggest issue now will be protecting people during the trade war. Mr. Carney sends a reassuring message that Canada can protect itself by working on its own economy, breaking down internal trade barriers, building infrastructure, and controlling day-to-day expenses of government. Those policies aren’t far from Mr. Poilievre’s, but the Conservative Leader suggests he’d fuel the development of oil and gas aggressively and issue ""massive"" tax cuts – both in response to the trade war and as longer-term policy. There’s little doubt that Mr. Poilievre is a more finely-honed main-street communicator – if sometimes over the top. And Mr. Nanos notes that a desire for change and cost-of-living issues are still on the minds of Canadians, and neither candidate has decisively won the battle over who would be best to handle Mr. Trump. But a year or two ago, a Mark Carney campaign would have seemed very different, with a wealthy former central banker running in a campaign about ordinary folks making ends meet. Mr. Trump’s crisis has made it possible for a Prime Minister Mark Carney to be sworn in, and run, plausibly, for election. That’s before a rookie politician, rushed into office atop a once-collapsing party, heads into a campaign amid a governing crisis that suggests bigger questions for the country’s future. A mid-campaign curveball from south of the border is more likely than ever. Mr. Poilievre won’t want to be receiving another endorsement from Elon Musk, Mr. Teneycke noted. A presidential post on Truth Social could be a foil for Mr. Carney to wave the nationalist flag or a trap that catches him in a bind. It’s like juggling in a windstorm – and for Mr. Carney, on a whole new stage. The new Prime Minister has an unpredictable crisis election rushing at him of a kind Canadians haven’t seen before.

There’s no Poilievre without Trudeau. That’s why the Conservative Leader seems broken,2025.0,"Physician and author of We are All Perfectly Fine: A Memoir of Love, Medicine and Healing The child psychiatrist Donald Winnicott famously said, “There is no such thing as an infant.” He wasn’t a nihilist, or delusional – he was illustrating the degree to which our identities are interdependent. A baby needs someone to change, feed and nurture it. Without the existence of a mother, or some person to whom the baby belongs, there is – philosophically but also literally – no baby.

And I wonder if his problem is related to Winnicott’s theories of development. Maybe there is no Pierre without Justin.

Can we find out if he’s ever been to Carnegie Hall?”) Patriotic Canadians are uniting in defence of their country at the threat posed by Donald Trump, but Mr. Poilievre still seems desperate to convince us that we should be focusing on calls coming from inside the house. For many people, Mr. Poilievre simply embodies the zeitgeist of a broader global “me first” movement. One key element of that zeitgeist is “destrudo.” Destrudo is a term from Freudian psychology. It is, simply, the death instinct – the impulse to conquer, vanquish, and destroy. Destrudo is volcanic, acerbic, hostile; it can be directed at another country, or squarely at a person. Everyone has destrudo. Like all impulses, it needs counterweight to be controlled. Nothing good is ever built by destrudo. But it is very efficient at burning things we love to the ground. The other day, I asked my husband if he’d ever heard of it. “Destroy … Trudeau?” he said. My jaw dropped. Speaking it out loud, I heard a double-entendre so perfect it wouldn’t be believable as a plot line in a B movie. Destrudeau. Yes, Justin Trudeau is finished, done, symbolically destroyed. But in another cinematic twist, he leaves on the heels of the two best high-stakes addresses of his life. In his final act, Mr. Trudeau reminded us powerfully of who we are as Canadians – and who we aspire to be. And that’s the crux of it – Pierre Poilievre’s paradox and his pesky problem, one he is scrambling to solve but that may be fundamentally out of his reach. This moment has left an opening for a new leader to sneak by him, one who can speak not just to our bitter grievances but to our aspirations and dreams, who can organize not our worst demons but our better angels. There’s a reason the wartime directive is “keep calm and carry on” and not “freak out and smash things.” We won’t get through the years ahead without a Prime Minister who models emotional discipline and gives us the faith that we can carry on – while we also care for and help each other. We need someone who can unite and inspire. I don’t think that person is Mr. Poilievre. I think he can only incite. There is no baby without a mother, no Sideshow Bob without a Bart, and no Pierre without a Justin. It was all Destrudeau, and Mr. Trudeau has left the building.

Everyone has destrudo. Like all impulses, it needs counterweight to be controlled. Nothing good is ever built by destrudo. But it is very efficient at burning things we love to the ground. The other day, I asked my husband if he’d ever heard of it. ""Destroy … Trudeau?"" he said. M y jaw dropped. Speaking it out loud, I heard a double-entendre so perfect it wouldn’t be believable as a plot line in a B movie. Destrudeau. Yes, Justin Trudeau is finished, done, symbolically destroyed. But in another cinematic twist, he leaves on the heels of the two best high-stakes addresses of his life. In his final act, Mr. Trudeau reminded us powerfully of who we are as Canadians – and who we aspire to be. And that’s the crux of it – Pierre Poilievre’s paradox and his pesky problem, one he is scrambling to solve but that may be fundamentally out of his reach. This moment has left an opening for a new leader to sneak by him, one who can speak not just to our bitter grievances but to our aspirations and dreams, who can organize not our worst demons but our better angels. There’s a reason the wartime directive is ""keep calm and carry on"" and not ""freak out and smash things."" We won’t get through the years ahead without a Prime Minister who models emotional discipline and gives us the faith that we can carry on – while we also care for and help each other. We need someone who can unite and inspire. I don’t think that person is Mr. Poilievre. I think he can only incite. There is no baby without a mother, no Sideshow Bob without a Bart, and no Pierre without a Justin. It was all Destrudeau , and Mr. Trudeau has left the building.

Carney spells big trouble for Poilievre,2025.0,"Mark Carney, who will officially become prime minister on Friday, is walking into the job as a serious threat to Pierre Poilievre, according to the latest polling from Abacus Data that shows Carney ranked higher than the Conservative leader across a wide range of skills. It means that the federal election campaign expected within days is going to be intense and extremely ""fluid,"" according to Abacus CEO David Coletto. In this latest tracking, the Conservative lead in support has shrunk to just four points ahead of the Liberals among decided voters - 38 per cent to 34 per cent. ""The horse race is the tightest that it's been in quite a while,"" Coletto said. ""The Liberals have hit a point in their vote share that we have not seen since before the last federal election in 2021"" Not so long ago, the Conservatives were boasting a lead of 20-plus percentage points over the Liberals, but the combination of Justin Trudeau's resignation, Donald Trump's threats to Canada and Carney's arrival in the top job has changed all of that. On the last point, this newest Abacus poll has some fascinating findings about how Canadians see Carney in comparison to Poilievre, and suggests that the Liberal leader's honeymoon is coming largely at the expense of the Conservative leader. Abacus laid out eight tasks for a future prime minister and asked whether Carney or Poilievre would be better at them. Carney was seen as more skilled at six of the eight. He was judged better than the Conservative leader on finding common ground, standing up to a bully and helping people manage household expenses, as well as being the man people would prefer to see captaining a ship through a storm, putting out a kitchen fire or sitting next to them on a long flight. Poilievre only had the advantage in this comparison when it came to two skills: hosting a party and putting up a shelf. Coletto confesses to some surprise at these results. A while back, Abacus asked these questions about the relative skills of Poilievre and Trudeau, and Poilievre was seen as superior in almost every way. But now respondents are judging Carney, a relative unknown, to be more adept - well, except for party hosting and shelf installation. ""Mark Carney is not a well-known, household name to most people,"" Coletto said. "" I don't think he's familiar to a lot of Canadians, but they're still projecting on him a lot of positive attributes, even if they don't maybe know for sure that it's true or not."" Coletto warns that it's too early for Liberals to break out the champagne - a lot will depend on whether Carney will measure up to the high expectations he's inspired as a yet-to-be tested leader and prime minister. But the poll does echo earlier findings from Abacus about Poilievre's likability problem - how Canadians saw him as a better alternative to Trudeau but maybe not their ideal choice. So what can the Conservatives do? The answer to that, says Coletto, is what the party has already been doing, day after day in its media messaging and, more importantly, in the wave of advertising it has been running against Carney. ""The ads are having an effect,"" he said, adding that they also may be stemming migration away from Conservatives toward Liberals. ""What the Conservatives have done is shored up at least some of that previous Conservative voter base, who were taking a peek at Mark Carney."" Abacus also found that negative impressions of Carney have been climbing more quickly than positive ones over the past month, and that's not good news for the incoming prime minister. At the end of February, Carney was judged positively by 36 per cent of respondents, and negatively by 26 per cent - a 10-point gap. Now, in the middle of March, his positives still outweigh the negatives, but by 37 per cent compared to 30 per cent. Abacus also looked at where Carney could be vulnerable, and much of that revolves around whether he really represents change - another theme that Poilievre has been hammering away at with his ""Just Like Justin"" ads. Abacus conducted this survey among 1,700 Canadians from March 10 to 12. Because respondents were surveyed online, the poll cannot be considered truly random. A comparable random sample of the same size would have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Coletto says that this rapid change in the polling shows that campaigns do matter, as the pros say, and this election could see some similarly volatile shifts. Volatility has been the watchword for the first few months of 2025; why should the election be any different?

Four dead in crashes in Abbotsford and Campbell River,2025.0,"Four people have died in two crashes in the past 24 hour, one in Abbotsford, the other in Campbell River. In Abbotsford, police say a pickup truck hit a telephone pole and flipped over shortly before 1 a.m. Thursday in the 32200-block of King Road. Paramedics tried to save the two occupants of the truck but they died. At about 3 p.m. on Wednesday, a newer model Honda SUV was headed south on the North Island Highway near Brown's Bay north of Campbell River when it crashed. The SUV with four occupants went off the road and collided with trees. The driver and one passenger died soon after impact, while two passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The cause is still being investigated, but Campbell River RCMP say a ""significant hailstorm"" at the time of the crash was likely a contributing factor. ticrawford@postmedia.com Related 10 people injured in multiple vehicle crash on Sea to Sky Highway Driver involved in Pattullo Bridge crash that left three dead arrested by Surrey police",The Vancouver Sun (Online); Vancouver,Vancouver,"Crawford, Tiffany",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 13, 2025",,,2025-03-13,The Vancouver Sun
"Letters:   Targeting Tesla and Starlink? You may want to think again, March 12 Ontario Premier Doug Ford to suspend electricity export tax amid upcoming discussions in Washington, March 11 Pierre Poilievre's Tories insist 'no one is panicking' at Mark Carney's rise, March 10 Dog at centre of Toronto mauling that injured child last year euthanized, owner pleads guilty, March 12",2025.0,"Bad idea to rely on Starlink Targeting Tesla and Starlink? You may want to think again, March 12 I take issue with the letter by Paul Graham in support of Tesla and Starlink. Hopefully he read Vinay Menon's excellent takedown of the unstable genius that is Elon Musk. If we ever came to rely on Starlink for our communications in any part of our country, we could be held hostage. No foreign entity, let alone a mercurial and erratic one, should be in a position to shut down our communications with the flick of a switch. We would never have a peaceful night's sleep again. As for the electric cars, they are easily replaced. Kurt Crist, Consecon, Ont. Canada should welcome all EVs My wife and I returned from three weeks in Australia visiting an old friend. He drove us around Tasmania in his (battery-electric) Hyundai Ioniq5 extensively. It handled Tasmania's narrow, winding roads extremely well for such a large, comfortable car. It has a range of about 450 kilometres, fully in line with a Tesla Model 3, and is about the same size. (Our daughter has a Tesla Model 3.) Australia has no domestic car industry and welcomes cars from any country. Tesla is far from the most common electric car on their roads. I saw several Chinese and Korean models, plus a few European and Japanese electric cars and panel vans. Worldwide, people are voting against Elon Musk's Tesla cars. European sales plummeted by 60 per cent, while electric car sales rose overall. The same is true in China, the world's largest electric car market. Canada should open its doors to European, Korean, Japanese and Chinese electric vehicles and admit them duty free. By reducing the price of electric cars, we would ease personal transport costs for Canadians hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Personally, I would welcome having some small electric cars to choose from. We love our electric mini, but its range is only around 200 km. We would like another smallish car with longer range and there are a number of models available, but not (yet) imported into Canada. Peter Bursztyn, Barrie Export surtaxes a better response Ontario Premier Doug Ford to suspend electricity export tax amid upcoming discussions in Washington, March 11 Counter-tariffs are the wrong strategy to combat U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The purpose of counter-tariffs is to drive up the cost to Canadians buying imported U.S. goods, thereby reducing demand for these goods and, by extension, punishing U.S. exporters. While tariff revenues accrue to the government applying the tariff, as has been pointed out to Trump numerous times, tariffs are paid by the consumer, not the supplier; so, they really just punish Canadians. It would be far better, and just as effective, for our governments to cease importing U.S. products, rescind select U.S. contracts, patents and copyrights, and erect non-tariff barriers for select U.S. imports. This would reduce demand, punish U.S. exporters and not cost Canadians a dime. As Star business columnist David Olive, former prime minister Jean Chrétien and others have pointed out, to fight Trump's tariffs it makes far more sense to apply export surtaxes to coveted rare earth minerals, potash, oil, electricity, nickel, aluminum, lumber, dairy, water, eggs, etc. Surtaxes are paid by U.S. importers, not Canadians. This windfall could be used to directly support Canadian families and businesses hurt by U.S. tariffs. Certainly, Premier Doug Ford's actions over the past week with electricity export surtaxes has proven their effectiveness as a defensive strategy. Peter Madott, Mississauga Ford should have held firm on his surcharge threat Premier Doug Ford puts a surcharge on electricity. Less than 24 hours later, Ford suspends the surcharge after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to double the tariffs on steel and aluminum. That is what people do in a trade war; they threaten each other. The proper response to Trump's threat is ""if you double the tariffs, the electricity surcharge doubles."" Ford just won an election vowing to fight Trump. Turns out, he has a glass chin. Clyde McDonald, Bracebridge, Ont. Why not deport agitator in chief? U.S. President Donald Trump wants agitators and troublemakers deported from the United States. Sounds like a good plan. Problem is there are few countries willing to accept him. Robert Woodcock, North York Poilievre is too Trump-like to stand up to him Pierre Poilievre's Tories insist 'no one is panicking' at Mark Carney's rise, March 10 And so it begins, another round of American-style attack ads on prime minister-designate Mark Carney by the Conservative party. With a party that has nothing to offer, it's easier to tear down than build up. There's an opportunity now with an imminent election to stand up for Canada, but obviously that isn't part of the political game plan. At a time when Canada is under threat from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, where is Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre? Understandably, with many of his party's supporters being Trump enthusiasts, it's hard for him to come out against Trump. Maybe he himself is too Trump-like. If we look at his actions and words, there is some truth to that: supporting the so-called ""Freedom Convoy,"" wanting to fire the governor of the Bank of Canada, proposing to slash social programs and getting rid of government employees. Gee, doesn't that sound like what's going on in Washington right now? No wonder Poilievre is keeping his mouth shut.

Poilievre owns 'grating' style in new Quebec ads; Charm Offensive,2025.0,"A new Frenchlanguage advertisement starring Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre begins uncharacteristically for a campaign ad, with Poilievre offering an admission that his style of politics can seem brusque at times, especially to Quebecers. ""Some people think my style is too direct, too blunt,"" says Poilievre, leaning on a desk and smiling. The party and Poilievre want to explain his style to Quebec voters, according to sources who spoke on background. The Conservative party launched its biggest radio, TV and online ad campaign to date in Quebec to show how approachable he is, how funny he can be and why he does politics the way he does. Poilievre's office did not comment on this story. ""I wonder, should we be cute and docile when negotiating tariffs with Donald Trump? Let's take back control and put Canada first,"" says Poilievre in one of the three versions of the ad. Alain Rayes, the former Quebec lieutenant to Conservative leaders Andrew Scheer and Erin O' Toole, who is now an independent MP, saw the ad over the weekend where the relaxed Poilievre tries to explain himself to Quebecers. ""I think he will convince people,"" he said. ""When you meet him, he is very friendly. I still believe he is an extremely smart politician. But he uses techniques that I disapprove of,"" he added. Rayes knows a thing or two about Poilievre's style. He was attacked by the party in an automated text message sent out to party members in his riding of Richmond-Arthabaska days after Poilievre was elected leader in 2022. At the time, Rayes had just led Jean Charest's failed leadership campaign and had left the Conservative caucus because his ""political ideals, values and convictions (were) not compatible"" with those of Poilievre. The attack implied that Rayes had quit the Conservative party because he ""decided not to fight (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau's inflation with Pierre Poilievre's united team."" The party then apologized. ""There is kind of a moral endorsement by the tone that Pierre Poilievre uses. So, these people were reassured with the overwhelming vic- tory they had during the leadership race. They felt that they had the right strategy and tone,"" said Rayes in an interview with the National Post. Rayes is just one example of Poilievre's targets. The leader gives his opponents nicknames. He has called the mayors of Montreal and Quebec City ""incompetent"" and has argued for months that the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party of Canada are in a coalition, when they are not. ""In Quebec, the Republican-style politics doesn't jive,"" said a Conservative source. But Poilievre wants to win in Quebec, sources tell us. In fact, he may even need Quebec, especially with the Liberals surging in the polls. With 10 seats, the Conserv- atives are hoping to boost their fortunes in the next election by flipping Bloc seats in Centre-du-Québec, Quebec City and SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. Eric Blais, the president of Headspace Marketing, who has worked for more than 40 years in marketing and communications in English and French Canada, said he was surprised by Poilievre's apparent admission that he has a ""grating sort of style"", a style that isn't exactly ""endearing with many Quebecers."" ""So he's trying to address the elephant in the room, but I don't think he is, because to then pivot and suggest that that very style is what's needed to fight Trump ... 'I'm the right guy, because I have a style that is, that can be dis- ruptive, that can be grating', I'm not so sure Quebecers are going to buy that,"" said Blais. According to him, Poilievre still has a ""Je ne sais quoi"", something that just doesn't land with this electorate. ""These videos confirm that he knows it. Though it might be a strength to fight Trump, this admission will not make him more sympathetic in the minds of Quebec voters,"" he suggested. Sources close to him would not say whether Poilievre intends to change his style. ""He's himself and he speaks for himself,"" one of them said. So, what is the offer to Quebecers? In his Canada first rally, Poilievre mentioned La Belle Province a few times in his hour-long speech, but did not propose anything specific for Quebecers. ""Our heritage and citizenship departments will have an official policy of promoting our common national identity. The goal is not to erase our differences but to bridge them,"" he said. He also focused on national symbols like Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister, who is still a divisive figure in Quebec. And Terry Fox, a national hero he wants to see on Canadians' passports. In fact, the Liberals took issue with many of the things he said in his speech. ""Where has Pierre been? He is late to the game. A new slogan does not change the fact he has always put Canada second after his own interest and career,"" said Guillaume Bertrand, who was the Liberal Quebec lieutenant Jean-Yves Duclos's spokesperson at the time. In a recent press conference, Poilievre's Quebec Lieutenant Pierre Paul-Hus said the party will elaborate on its offer to Quebecers during the next campaign. ""What we recognize is that Quebec is a nation that has different issues that must be addressed in a particular way in Quebec. So, in the details we will go further in time and place,"" he said. In 2019 and 2021, Rayes convinced the party to launch a platform solely for Quebec, to recognize the ""distinct society"" and to convince the nationalists to move away from the Bloc Québécois. It didn't work, and in another move that hopes to change Conservative fortunes in Quebec, Poilievre will not present such a platform this time.

However, I suggest to you that we do have a few unlikely allies. There's the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and, last but not least, the Dow Jones Industrials. Trump very much watches the markets and he likes to brag about them when they reach new highs under his watch. When Trump's tariffs were ready to go into effect, the markets tanked and Trump blinked. He delayed or put temporary holds on his tariffs and markets rallied. Then, in the last few days, his tariffs are about to be applied (again) and once again the markets are falling. And the markets especially don't like Elon Musk and his Tesla stock. It has dropped by around 30 per cent in the past month. So don't discount the stock markets and by extension, big U.S. corporations being in our corner in this fight. And you can be sure Trump is paying attention. Dennis Shaughnessy, Bailieboro, Ont. Targeting Telsa and Starlink? Think again Ontario rips up Starlink deal, plans to add energy surcharge in response to tariffs, March 4 For years now ""progressive"" politicians have stopped oil pipelines, introduced carbon pricing, banned plastic straws and encouraged people to buy electric vehicles, all in order to save the planet. But today, it seems, saving the planet only comes second to punishing Elon Musk because of his political support of Donald Trump. Musk currently produces the most efficient electric vehicles in the world. He also owns and operates Starlink, the most widely used internet provider, the only one capable of reaching every corner of the planet. In a fit of pique, many are now encouraging people to ditch their Teslas and Starlink systems. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. Interconnectivity is crucial to our rural and northern regions, and Elon's competitors are years behind in electric vehicle development (as evidenced by sales figures). Is virtue-signalling really a higher priority than virtuous action now? Think before you act. Paul Graham, Mississauga Carney needs to show he has what it takes to lead Mark Carney is the new Liberal leader. What happens now? March 10 To prime minister-designate Mark Carney, many of us know you are brilliant regarding economic matters, but you need to convince us of the passionate and fighting side of your personality.

Beverley Murray, Burlington Poilievre is not the man we need at this moment Poilievre should have seen his true opponents coming. Now he's in trouble, Feb. 18 Federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been compared to Donald Trump, and for good reason. Poilievre has been telling Canadians that Canada is broken, and he is promising to defund and abolish many of the institutions that make us uniquely Canadian should he be elected prime minister. Now that he's sliding in the polls he has wrapped himself in the flag and adopted a new slogan: ""Canada First."" He also has called on mentor Stephen Harper, current chair of the International Democracy Union, a global network of right and far-right political parties with strong ties to the U.S. Republican party, to write an open letter casting doubt on Mark Carney's character and credentials. Canada needs a prime minister with global credentials and experience to guide our economy into a new era. Kat Duffy, Mississauga Canada requires a unified front in trade war It's time to turn up the pain on America. Let's start with 200% surtaxes on the commodities they need, March 6 David Olive's recent article urging 200 per cent surcharges on exports to the U.S. reflects the magnitude of what is at stake in the ever-changing tariff war. The growing season will get underway soon in the American Midwest. Many farmers supported Donald Trump's return to the White House, yet now they are burdened with fuel charges and high bank loans. Many farmers are reeling from Elon Musk's DOGE policy of cancelling USAID, a vital outlet for American agricultural products. These proposed 200 per cent tariffs on potash, a vital component of fertilizer, would be almost as devastating to farmers today as the Dust Bowl was in the 1930s. Surcharges on energy and electricity would damage the industrial sector as it scrambles to find alternative sources for American energy, especially as the auto sector ramps up production for the 2026 model year. The heat waves of last summer are a distant memory, but summer will arrive soon enough in the U.S. Just imagine the sweltering cities that Philadelphia or Boston or New York City would become without imported Canadian electricity for their transit systems or office and residential air conditioning. Also, the annual family summer road trip would become a memory of a halcyon age as the price of gasoline for the family station wagon or SUV doubles or possibly triples. Here in Canada, all provincial premiers should get in line with this goal. There should be no deviation by any leader, federal, provincial or at the local level. G.A. Corcoran, Toronto Canadians need to boycott goods from red states Canadians must hit MAGA consumers in their wallets, because Trump will listen to their screams. I would like to see a list of products from red states that we can boycott. Taking bourbon off the LCBO shelves hurts Kentucky. What other boycotts would also be effective? Yet there is a flaw in my argument: Trump may no longer care about maintaining his base. Because if he wants to stay on as president in 2028, he will just write an executive order to try to make it so.

Poilievre sounds like yesterday's man,2025.0,"So Mark Carney will be Canada's next prime minister, until an election. Pierre Poilievre has been measuring drapes for a little over two years, and then Donald Trump was elected, and the world started sliding into the sea. When Carney is sworn in, he will jump right into history. And when Canada decides between the parties of Carney and Poilievre, the most important question has to be who understands the assignment. There will be arguments over domestic policy. There are already anti-Carney attack ads on TV, and Carney spent some of his victory speech Sunday smashing Poilievre. At times, this may even feel like an ordinary election campaign. It's not. Trump's near-daily tariff dance is exhausting, and Elon Musk's gormless attempt to demolish the American government is a catastrophe that is reshaping the globe. It is easy to be overwhelmed: it's like trying to count the shards of a broken window, and then another, and then another. But the next prime minister will have to reimagine and re-engineer Canada's place in the world, or at least start the work, because this is the fight of our lives. Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stood in front of the country and said, very deliberately, ""We have to fold back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us."" Trudeau said much the same thing on a hot mic in February. Last week, the New York Times reported some new details on calls between Trudeau and Trump in mid-February; some had been previously reported by the Star's Tonda MacCharles and Josh Rubin. Trump raised breaking the 1908 treaty that set the U.S.-Canada border, and intimated Canada did not deserve to be part of Norad. The NYT added the prospect of Canada being expelled from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network that includes Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, although it seems more and more clear that Five Eyes may already be dead. And Trump talked about revisiting our shared lakes and rivers. Norad, NATO, Five Eyes, NAFTA and then CUSMA: these are bastions that have protected Canada from the world. The border, our abundant fresh water, our critical minerals, and softwood lumber: these are prizes. Russia sits on our very northern border, and the Arctic is a prize, too. And in this new world, if international agreements are replaced by sheer power, Canada is a weakling, and Trump and the right-wing propaganda apparatus in the United States have a hold on their followers that is akin to mass hypnosis. So who understands that existential threat, and that Canada needs to consider possibilities outside our existing national imagination? Carney's speech was explicit: he addressed the Trump threat as a central theme, speaking of ""dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust."" He said, ""Donald Trump thinks - thinks - he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer."" Critically, he mentioned ""a plan that creates new trade corridors with reliable partners."" He used a lot of it to link Poilievre to Trump. But Carney at least seems to grasp that Canada can never again trust a nation that elected Trump twice. Poilievre gave a counter-programming speech Sunday, and did mention Trump, but only in his own attack-dog context. He said, ""Our economy has become so weak that President Trump, unjustifiably and wrongly, threatens us with tariffs."" He said, ""Donald Trump will have a big smile on his face as he exploits all of Carney's many conflicts to attack Canadian workers and Canadian jobs."" He said, ""All the steelmakers in Canada will be out of Canada in no time, heading straight into the arms of Donald Trump, if Mark Carney brings in a carbon tax on our industry."" No dark days. No talk of a loss of trust. Poilievre, like almost everybody else, has endorsed retaliatory tariffs. But in his Canada First speech, he repeated his ultimate goal: closer economic ties to the United States, and to ""team up against the unfair trading practices of other countries,"" which repeats Trump's language against Canada. He's still repeating Trump's flimsy excuses for treating us this badly: fentanyl and the border. He even said Carney was talking about Trump to distract from Carney and Trudeau's record. Talk about yesterday's man. And in the worst case, closer economic ties with the Americans sounds like Belarus as sketched out by Kevin O'Leary. We'll see if a central banker like Carney can understand radical change, but Poilievre seems unable to grasp that Canada can never trust an America with a MAGA movement that has fallen into self-abnegation, fingerpainting fascism, and utter unreality. Then again, a good chunk of Poilievre's own voters still approve of all that. But if this election is contested on what might be the most important question in Canadian history - how does Canada remain a sovereign nation in a disintegrating world - the choice may be imperfect, but it might be clear.

"Poilievre has been called 'too blunt' and 'grating' in Quebec. Now, he's owning it",2025.0,"OTTAWA - A new French-language advertisement starring Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre begins uncharacteristically for a campaign ad, with Poilievre offering an admission that his style of politics can seem brusque at times, especially to Quebecers. ""Some people think my style is too direct, too blunt,"" says Poilievre, leaning on a desk and smiling. The party and Poilievre want to explain his style to Quebec voters, according to sources who spoke on background. The Conservative party launched its biggest radio, TV and online ad campaign to date in Quebec to show how approachable he is, how funny he can be and why he does politics the way he does. Poilievre's office did not comment on this story. ""I wonder, should we be cute and docile when negotiating tariffs with Donald Trump? Let's take back control and put Canada first,"" says Poilievre in one of the three versions of the ad. Alain Rayes, the former Quebec lieutenant to Conservative leaders Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole, who is now an independent MP, saw the ad over the weekend where the relaxed Poilievre tries to explain himself to Quebecers. ""I think he will convince people,"" he said. ""When you meet him, he is very friendly. I still believe he is an extremely smart politician. But he uses techniques that I disapprove of,"" he added. Rayes knows a thing or two about Poilievre's style. He was attacked by the party in an automated text message sent out to party members in his riding of Richmond-Arthabaska days after Poilievre was elected leader in 2022. At the time, Rayes had just led Jean Charest's failed leadership campaign and had left the Conservative caucus because his ""political ideals, values and convictions (were) not compatible"" with those of Poilievre. The attack implied that Rayes had quit the Conservative party because he ""decided not to fight (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau's inflation with Pierre Poilievre's united team."" The party then apologized. ""There is kind of a moral endorsement by the tone that Pierre Poilievre uses. So, these people were reassured with the overwhelming victory they had during the leadership race. They felt that they had the right strategy and tone,"" said Rayes in an interview with the National Post. Rayes is just one example of Poilievre's targets. The leader gives his opponents nicknames. He has called the mayors of Montreal and Quebec City ""incompetent"" and has argued for months that the Bloc Québécois and the Liberal Party of Canada are in a coalition, when they are not. ""In Quebec, the Republican-style politics doesn't jive,"" said a Conservative source. But Poilievre wants to win in Quebec, sources tell us. In fact, he may even need Quebec, especially with the Liberals surging in the polls. With 10 seats, the Conservatives are hoping to boost their fortunes in the next election by flipping Bloc seats in Centre-du-Québec, Quebec City and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Eric Blais, the president of Headspace Marketing, who has worked for more than 40 years in marketing and communications in English and French Canada, said he was surprised by Poilievre's apparent admission that he has a ""grating sort of style"", a style that isn't exactly ""endearing with many Quebecers."" ""So he's trying to address the elephant in the room, but I don't think he is, because to then pivot and suggest that that very style is what's needed to fight Trump... 'I'm the right guy, because I have a style that is, that can be disruptive, that can be grating', I'm not so sure Quebecers are going to buy that,"" said Blais. According to him, Poilievre still has a ""je ne sais quoi,"" something that just doesn't land with this electorate. ""These videos confirm that he knows it. Though it might be a strength to fight Trump, this admission will not make him more sympathetic in the minds of Quebec voters,"" he suggested. Sources close to him would not say whether Poilievre intends to change his style. ""He's himself and he speaks for himself,"" one of them said. So, what is the offer to Quebecers? In his Canada First rally, Poilievre mentioned La Belle Province a few times in his hour-long speech, but did not propose anything specific for Quebecers. ""Our heritage and citizenship departments will have an official policy of promoting our common national identity. The goal is not to erase our differences but to bridge them,"" he said. He also focused on national symbols like Sir John A. MacDonald, Canada's first prime minister, who is still a divisive figure in Quebec. And Terry Fox, a national hero he wants to see on Canadians' passports. In fact, the Liberals took issue with many of the things he said in his speech. ""Where has Pierre been? He is late to the game. A new slogan does not change the fact he has always put Canada second after his own interest and career,"" said Guillaume Bertrand, who was the Liberal Quebec lieutenant Jean-Yves Duclos's spokesperson at the time. In a recent press conference, Poilievre's Quebec Lieutenant Pierre Paul-Hus said the party will elaborate on its offer to Quebecers during the next campaign. ""What we recognize is that Quebec is a nation that has different issues that must be addressed in a particular way in Quebec. So, in the details we will go further in time and place,"" he said. In 2019 and 2021, Rayes convinced the party to launch a platform solely for Quebec, to recognize the ""distinct society"" and to convince the nationalists to move away from the Bloc Québécois.

Carney will fight Poilievre using Ford's playbook,2025.0,"The path to victory for Mark Carney's Liberals starts in Ontario. And that pathway picks up where Doug Ford left off on the campaign trail. The victorious Feb. 27 election by Ford's Tories was a dry run for the coming federal campaign. Ontario's premier just showed the federal Liberals the playbook for defeating another Tory, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Ford's main play was campaigning against America's president. That's the road map the new federal Liberal leader, soon to be prime minister, is following so far: Just as Ford played the role of Captain Canada, so too Carney is playing the nationalist card in the national campaign to come. The major difference is that while Ford ran almost exclusively against Donald Trump, Carney is going one step further - by vilifying Poilievre's Tories as the incarnation and iteration of Trump's movement to Make America Great Again (while making Canada part of a greater America). At every opportunity, Liberals are reminding voters how Conservative MPs and supporters have flirted with the MAGA movement, worn MAGA merchandise, bought into MAGA manipulation and are burdened by MAGA baggage. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly tried out those lines on the Star's editorial board last week, and Carney echoed that pitch in his leadership victory speech Sunday night by portraying the Tory leader as Trump's fellow traveller. ""Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,"" Carney said. ""A person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him."" While the path to victory becomes clearer on the campaign trial, the ground keeps shifting for the federal Tories as their favourite slogans face moving targets: Justin Trudeau a tired prime minister? Gone. Carbon tax? Axed. Inflation or ""Justinflation?"" Tamed. Time for a change? Just changed leaders. Poilievre's problem is that his agenda for change has changed ahead of schedule. Which is why he keeps harping on the spectre of Liberals winning their ""fourth term in power"" as a way to remind voters that they should ""throw the bums out."" Interestingly for Carney, Ford laboured under some of those same negatives - a slowing economy with rising inflation, and the accumulated baggage of imbroglios and improprieties as he sought a third consecutive majority government. Unlike Carney, Ford had the additional burden of having been caught on an open mic, in mid-campaign, that he ""100 per cent"" rooted for Trump to win last November, notwithstanding his tariff agenda. Yet in his own bid for re-election as premier, Ford neutralized his negatives by persuading voters he was working for them, as Abacus Data pollster David Coletto said in a post-election interview. ""Doug Ford did something in this election that almost no incumbent anywhere has been able to do at a time when the cost of living and inflation and affordability have been the primary focus for voters,"" Coletto told me. ""They believed he was on their side. And that's a really powerful force in politics."" A similar battle for hearts and minds - and votes - is now pitting Carney against Poilievre. It also explains why the federal Tories are trying so hard at every turn to cast Carney as an out-of-touch elitist. The problem is that the pugnacious Poilievre lacks the ""everyman"" persona of a self-consciously folksy Ford. The premier's penchant for giving out his mobile phone number to one and all is a symbolic reminder of how different his public image is from that of his federal counterpart. Tellingly, Ford fired off warm congratulations on Sunday night - mere minutes after Carney won the Liberal leadership race - expressing hope that they'd work together as he did with Trudeau as PM. Yet Poilievre didn't bother sending any public tribute when Ford won his third election victory; which may explain why the premier made a point of saying Monday that he'd be keeping his distance from the federal campaign (unlike some of his predecessors who helped their counterparts where they could). It is one of the continuing oddities of Canadian politics that the federal Conservative who aspires to power as the next prime minister has no connection to Ford, currently the country's most powerful Tory. They barely know each other and almost never talk. If they did, Ford might pass on the latest polling data he picked up in the final days of the provincial vote. While the election was supposed to be about ""affordability,"" it's now ""survivability"" and ""continuity"" in an ""emergency"" that are increasingly top of mind for voters. Day by day, month by month, election by election, the ground is shifting and the ballot question is changing - and it's no longer all about change.","Toronto Star; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,"Torstar Syndication Services, a Division of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited","Mar 11, 2025",Political campaigns; Voters; Political leadership; Prime ministers,,2025-03-11,Toronto Star
Liberals rush to move past Trudeau while Poilievre wants to lo ok back,2025.0,"Things are in flux in Ottawa. When will Mark Carney call an election? “That will be up to the new boss,” Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon replied. Liberals’ eyes turned so quickly from Justin Trudeau to Mark Carney that the technicalities were ignored. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly not only declared a “new era is starting,” but referred to Mr. Trudeau as “our former prime minister.” Yet Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre sounded like he didn’t want the Prime Minister to go. He held a press conference on Parliament Hill that did a lot of looking back. All of his lines of attack about Mr. Carney – except for one – were more or less about Mr. Trudeau’s record, as if Mr. Poilievre had invested so much in slogans aimed at Mr. Trudeau that he couldn’t afford to ditch them. Maybe that’s just an effort to seize the last day or two when Mr. Trudeau is still PM and in the same room, and the same camera frame, as Mr. Carney, to tie the two together. But Mr. Carney is pushing the next election, probably less than two weeks away, around getting Canada through the next four years of U.S. President Donald Trump. The new Liberal Leader is rushing to be sworn in quickly and trigger a campaign, and the issues Canadians worry about have shifted. Mr. Poilievre seems reluctant to adjust to that. It’s as if he sees responding to new political circumstances as a weakness. It’s not that he still insists a carbon-levy election is coming, it’s that he seems to take offence at the suggestion that that might not be the ballot question, as if changes in the political landscape are a personal insult. You can see why Mr. Poilievre would argue, as he started to yesterday, that Mr. Carney is trying to distract from the Liberal record in government by talking about Mr. Trump. After all, it’s true. That’s pretty much the whole reason Liberals chose Mr. Carney as their leader: because he wasn’t in Mr. Trudeau’s government, and because the former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England has a résumé and style that give him the look and feel of someone who could manage through a made-in-Trump world economic crisis. Mr. Carney is going to be banging that drum till voting day. So yes, the Conservative Leader is obviously going to have to run against the Liberal economic record. But he’s also going to have to take aim at Mr. Carney’s economic plans, because voters tend to think about the future. That’s why it was strange that Mr. Poilievre scrambled to throw everything at him. He claimed Mr. Carney is “trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest,” which haven’t surfaced yet, anyway. Why throw an obstacle in the way when you are trying to get everyone to focus on the Liberal record on the economy? There is that one line of attack that has some real bite – that Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. recently moved its headquarters to New York while Mr. Carney was chair. It runs embarrassingly against the current wave of nationalist sentiment and relates to the Tories’ effort to keep pointing out that the new Liberal Leader is a wealthy man who doesn’t have to worry about the price of groceries. It’s fair, too, for Mr. Poilievre to point out that Mr. Carney’s plan to scrap the fuel charge – also known as the consumer carbon tax – means beefing up the carbon-levy regime for industrial emitters. But it still sounds ridiculous because Mr. Poilievre still won’t say if Conservatives would keep industrial carbon levies. It’s not strange that the Conservative Leader doesn’t want to abandon affordability and tax cuts as his central issues. Mr. Poilievre has tax cuts imprinted in his system. There is still widespread anxiety about the cost of living. Focusing on that made Mr. Poilievre the front-runner to win the next election – and he still is. But worry about what Mr. Trump means for Canada’s economy is real. Polls suggest it now tops the list of Canadians’ concerns. Every party’s economic agenda has to succeed on that ground, because that’s what Canadians fear for their future. And Mr. Poilievre still sounds strangely like he doesn’t want to go there.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Campbell, Clark",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 11, 2025",Political campaigns; Tax cuts; Carbon; Prime ministers,Nom: Liberal Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-03-11,The Globe and Mail
"Three people Carney should thank: Freeland, Poilievre and Trump",2025.0,"No success was ever achieved without the help of others. Oh sure, winners always thank the usual suspects: supportive family, diligent staff, long-suffering spouse. But nobody ever salutes the players who never intended to offer an assist – yet did. Three key actors deserve major credit for Mark Carney’s election as Liberal Leader and prime minister-designate – and for the fact that his party, long poised for a quick march into electoral oblivion, now stands on the precipice of a fourth mandate. Chrystia Freeland: Mr. Carney might still be enjoying a richly compensated life in the master of the universe division of the private sector, and still pondering whether to enter Canadian politics, were it not for what Ms. Freeland, then the finance minister and deputy prime minister, did on the morning of Dec. 16, 2024. Her resignation letter’s line about “costly political gimmicks” summed up the feelings of a lot of voters and struck like a stiletto to the heart of government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau never was able to stanch the bleeding. Three weeks later, the leadership race began. As often happens in business, an innovative first-mover set a new dynamic in motion, only to have a later arrival reap the rewards. Donald Trump: Even before his return to the White House, the U.S. President started threatening our economy and our existence. The country sees itself as in peril, and it is in peril. That has remade Canadian politics. As Ontario Premier Doug Ford just demonstrated – turning a provincial election into a referendum on “who’s gonna fight for you?” – the threat from south of the border is now the No. 1 issue for Canadians. The U.S. chief executive is a menace to Canada. But danger is also a political opportunity for Mr. Carney and the Liberals. Canadian politicians must walk a fine line. They must stand up for Canada, and when Mr. Trump hits, they have to hit back. But they must also be very careful about who they’re hitting, and who they’re chirping. The master at this has been Mr. Ford. He’s talked the toughest on tariffs, including in a series of appearances on U.S. TV. But he always says, again and again, that he loves our neighbours, he wishes the two countries could have an even closer relationship, and this fight isn’t with all Americans, but with just one American. Mr. Carney went over the line in his acceptance speech on Sunday night, when he described the U.S. as “a country we can no longer trust.” That may turn out be true, but for now, it’s the wrong message. Our aim is for Americans to come to their senses and see things as we do, not rally around the flag. And for at least the next four years, the one problematic American will be in power, and will need to be negotiated with. Canada’s actions must be firm – elbows up? Yup! – but our leaders have to be mindful of what they say. As every Canadian hockey player knows, let your game do the talking, and keep it respectful off the ice. Pierre Poilievre: By upending Canadian politics, Mr. Trump stole certain electoral victory from the Conservative Leader. But with his promises of “putting more money in your pocket” and building pipelines, Mr. Carney’s platform has also stolen from the Conservatives. In fact, Mr. Carney and the Liberals have effectively co-opted three out of four of Mr. Poilievre’s marquee slogans. “Axe the Tax?” Mr. Poilievre spent the last two years beating the Liberals with that popular demand. Mr. Carney borrowed it and made it the centrepiece of his leadership campaign. “Fix the Budget?” Mr. Carney has a different idea of how to do it, which may involve a certain degree of sleight of hand, by dividing the budget into operating and investment accounts. Nonetheless, Mr. Carney’s repeated statements that Canada “needs to spend less” while “investing more,” is a Liberal take on a popular Conservative talking point. “Build the Homes?” The Liberals lifted that from Mr. Poilievre more than a year ago. The last unappropriated Conservative slogan is “Stop the Crime” – and Mr. Carney would be wise to appropriate it, too. Post-Trudeau Liberals should eagerly agree with Canadians (and disagree with the worst of Liberal progressive impulses) that crime is a problem, full stop. Don’t add a “but … .” Don’t try to change the topic to “systemic something-something.” Do offer different, better answers than the Conservatives. Edmonton: If Mr. Carney wants to swing for the political fences (and thank the city where he was raised), he should run in Edmonton. Maybe Edmonton West – it was a Liberal seat in the Jean Chrétien era, and Mr. Carney’s old high school is in the riding – or perhaps Edmonton Mill Woods, won for the Liberals by Edmonton Mayor Amarjeet Sohi in 2015. Of course, if the Liberals fail to win nationally, Mr. Carney will likely lose in Edmonton, too. With no seat and no government to lead, he could honourably exit politics as quickly as he entered. But what if a Liberal prime minister dared to run in Alberta? What if he won a seat in Alberta? What if he served as a Liberal PM – from Alberta? Imagine that.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Keller, Tony",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 11, 2025",Canada-US relations; Conservatism; Political campaigns; Political leadership; Prime ministers,,2025-03-11,The Globe and Mail
Bell: Carney and Poilievre - an ugly match-up in the brawl for it all,2025.0,"This is going to be a brawl. This is going to be a brutal battle. It will get ugly. There is too much at stake and too much bad blood for it to be anything but a political street fight. Mark Carney, now crowned the Liberal leader, soon to be the prime minister, hopefully soon to be running in an election against Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives, should not be underestimated, should in no way be written off. The Liberals are in it to win it and will throw everything they have at winning it. On Sunday night, Carney won his party's leadership in an absolute avalanche of enthusiasm. The Liberals stampeded to his side for one reason and one reason only. They think he can stop Poilievre and they hate Poilievre with a passion. Not so long ago there was no thought of the Liberals winning. Survival with a second-place finish would have been a victory of sorts. After all, the party ran Prime Minister Justin Trudeau out of Dodge as they faced a grim reality and a likely political curb-stomping. On Sunday night, Carney drops the gloves against Poilievre. Related Meet Mark Carney, Canada's inevitable, improbable next prime minister In a battle with Poilievre, even Liberals think Mark Carney needs improvement Let's be clear. The fact the Liberals even have a shot to hang on to power is because of one man. U.S. President Donald Trump. With this trade war angering Canadians, the Liberals wrap themselves in the flag, parade newly-minted patriotic sentiments and talk tough about Trump. The Liberals and the lefties rushing to the Liberals to try to block Poilievre out of the victory lane are those who are very vocal these days, very visible, very active. They're wearing their war face. A law of political physics these days. The higher the anxiety and anger of Canadians over Trump and his tariffs or his 51st state jabs or whatever, the better for the Liberals. So goes the thinking. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 3, 2025. And Carney knows beating up Trump is the gift that keeps on giving. He sure can't run on the Liberal record and there are many people who don't know him or are not convinced of anything he says about what he would do with four years of power. He talks about getting rid of the carbon tax, having a government spending less, backing oil and gas, creating a strong economy. But by far the biggest cheers for Carney from the Liberal faithful this past weekend tell the tale. ""Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer. Pierre Poilievre's plan will have us divided and ready to be conquered,"" says Carney. ""The person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him and not stand up to him."" Harsh stuff from the international banker. Carney is an unknown. He will have to make the right impression quickly. As well as casting himself as Captain Canada leading Canada Strong, Carney is already attempting to portray himself as the practical choice, a banker who knows his way around a balance sheet. A steady hand on the wheel in rough waters, a man who knows his way around the real world, not too liberal a Liberal. Liberals these days are trying to sound a little like conservatives for a simple reason. They can't win as Liberals. So what is this guy about? Liberal Leader Mark Carney talks to media as he leaves the prime minister's office and makes his way to a caucus meeting in Ottawa on Monday, March 10, 2025. It is easy to say you will fight Trump but it will take more than a wisecrack Carney made at a Winnipeg pub, where the soon-to-be prime minister compared Trump's insulting jabs to Harry Potter villain Voldemort. The story ran in the New York Post so Trump's people saw it. An Irish paper said it was ""brutal"" and ""an awkward comparison."" Not helpful. But his supporters eat it up. Carney says he wants change. How is he going to do that, purge the Liberals? Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is out the door and no tears will be shed here. But many of Trudeau's people are still around, the same old gang looking for a fourth term at the trough. Poilievre is hitting hard. He says the Liberal establishment put Mark Carney in power, pointing out the man advised Trudeau and is just more of the same. He reminded us the corporate Carney was board chairman at Brookfield Asset Management when Trump threatened Canada with tariffs and the company decided to move its headquarters from Toronto to New York City, Trump's hometown. ""He's the guy who sold out to Trump. He sold out Canada. He did exactly what Donald Trump wanted,"" says Poilievre, of Carney.

Poilievre accuses Carney of using Donald Trump to 'distract' Canadians,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre on Monday accused newly crowned Liberal Leader Mark Carney of trying to ""distract"" from how he spent his time before entering politics by focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump. Poilievre appeared before reporters to tell Canadians they should see no difference between outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the former central banker who will replace him. ""It's ironic,"" Poilievre said. ""Mr. Carney is trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest as well as his disastrous record as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser by talking about Trump."" Carney, who presented himself as a political outsider with deep economic experience, won the Liberal party leadership in a crushing first-ballot victory. He captured nearly 86 per cent of the vote. With the party unified behind him, Carney is expected to trigger an election before Parliament is set to resume on March 24. For weeks, public opinion polls have shown the year-and-a-half lead Poilievre has held over the Liberals to be narrowing as more Canadians are finding themselves increasingly consumed by Trump and his threat of tariffs and his repeated comments around annexation. 'Canadians love a good comeback': Carney hints at snap election in note to supporters In a battle with Poilievre, even Liberals think Mark Carney needs improvement The changing political landscape and Liberal surge have forced Poilievre to shift his message from affordability to why his party is best suited to steer Canada at a time when the U.S. has become an unreliable partner. ""Canadians have a choice in the next election,"" Poilievre said. Voters can choose to give Liberals a fourth term in power after they oversaw a historic rise in housing and food prices, Poilievre said. ""Or,"" he said, ""do they want 'Canada First' Conservatives who will axe taxes, build homes, unleash production of our resources and bring home paycheques, production and sovereignty to our country."" Poilievre has taken aim at Carney's record in business, noting how he has yet to disclose his assets and any potential conflicts of interest, which the new Liberal party leader said during the campaign that he would do as the rules require for public office holders. Given that Carney does not have a seat in the House of Commons, the ethics and conflict of interest rules covering elected officials did not apply to him during the leadership campaign. That prompted Poilievre to propose a way to close what he calls the ""Carney loophole"" by changing the rules so that leadership candidates must disclose their assets within 30 days of launching their campaigns. On Monday, Poilievre also pointed out that Carney has served as an adviser to Trudeau and in the past has endorsed climate change policies such as the consumer carbon tax. Carney has promised to scrap the unpopular consumer carbon tax and replace the quarterly cheques consumers receive with incentives to reduce their use and force industrial polluters to pay more. Even before Carney's victory, the Conservatives launched ads calling him ""sneaky"" and attacked him over his decision as chairman at Brookfield Assessment Management to endorse moving its headquarters to New York from Toronto. ""The Conservatives are resorting to the kind of dirty, personal politics that Mr. Poilievre has been known for since he was in cabinet with (former Conservative prime minister) Stephen Harper,"" Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Monday. ""That's unfortunate, but I actually think Canadians are not in that mood. Canadians are in a mood to rally around the flag, to rally around somebody who actually can stand up to Donald Trump."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Poilievre's tactics will only keep the party in opposition. ""Canadians are moving on from that,"" he told reporters. ""This is about our unity."" During the leadership campaign, Carney told reporters he was not involved in Brookfield's decision to move its headquarters to New York, but the Tories released a letter he sent to the company's shareholders that showed him encouraging them to approve the move. Carney later said he should have been more ""precise"" with his words. His campaign has also dismissed Poilievre's criticisms as exaggerated, saying it was only technical in nature and did not impact the company's Canadian operations. The company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

"In a battle with Poilievre, even Liberals think Mark Carney needs improvement",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Mark Carney may have been crowned leader of the Liberal party by casting himself as a political outsider, but his skills as a politician need work, say some of his supporters. Carney walked into an Ottawa convention centre Sunday as the presumed front-runner of the four candidates who were vying to replace Justin Trudeau as leader and prime minister. He left with a crushing first-ballot victory not matched by Trudeau or even Carney's political foe in the next election: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. With Carney open to calling a snap election by mid-March, National Post spoke with nearly 20 Liberals, many of whom support Carney, about how the two-time central banker will have to reconcile his political newcomer status with the demands of the campaign trail. Mark Carney wins Liberal leadership by a landslide with 86% of votes Full text: Mark Carney's Liberal leadership victory speech ""He has room to grow, for sure,"" said Liberal member Lucy Wright. ""He'll have a lot of supporters and as long as he listens to the people who are actually knowledgeable, I think he'll do well."" For Cathie Devries, that means putting an end to the questions Poilievre's Conservatives have been raising about his former role at Brookfield Asset Management. ""He needs to jump on that,"" she said. The (Conservative) party is trying to sow doubt. The Liberals and the party needs to do a better job explaining that."" While Carney has tried, Devries says ""some of the numbers and some of the answers don't add up."" Carney said he stepped down as chairman of the company when he launched his campaign back in January. After one of the party's debates, he told reporters he was not involved in the firm's decision to move its headquarters from Toronto to New York - a move the Tories are hammering, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump wants to attract companies south of the border. Poilievre's office then released a letter showing Carney told shareholders to vote in favour of the move, which they say is evidence Carney had lied to Canadians. Carney later acknowledged that he should have been more ""precise"" in his initial explanation. Longtime Liberal Bridget Girard pointed to the ads the Tories have already been running against Carney, labelling him as ""sneaky,"" as one of the challenges the new Liberal leader will face. Past Liberal leaders have struggled to recover from Conservative ad campaigns that defined them in the minds of voters. The best way to beat what Girard characterizes as the Tories' ""same old tired tricks"" is for Carney to ""just be genuine."" As a supporter, she expects him to speak to media more, which Carney did sparingly throughout the campaign, especially with the Parliamentary Press Gallery. Raymond LaFrance, who has been a Liberal supporter for 20 years and voted for Carney, says while he believes Carney's economic experience makes him the right man to lead Canada as it faces Trump's threats of tariffs and annexation, he worries about his French. ""He might come across a little bit as inexperienced,"" LaFrance said, saying Carney will face much different questions as a politician than he did as a central banker. ""He's going to be picked on, yelled at."" Christian Nkanu, a Francophone from New Brunswick, also cited Carney's French as an issue and a change from what the party has been used to under Trudeau. ""We can understand, but I think it's a weakness."" Nearly all Liberals told National Post that with the right team and more work, they believe Carney's economic credentials will more than make up for what he lacks in politics, even when it comes to facing off against Poilievre, whose team is partly banking on Carney's political inexperience to only help their fortunes as public opinion polls show the race to be tightening. However, some of Carney's supporters believe his resume is exactly what the Liberals needs to attract those who are thinking about voting for Poilievre. ""We need people who are sitting on the border, or who may have gone to leaning Conservative because they were angry with Trudeau to come back and to come to the Liberal side to look at something more centrist,"" said Donna Enwright from Haliburton, Ont., who became a Liberal party member to vote for Carney. ""And I think that's what Mark is. He's centre."" Iain Munro, who heads up the party's commission for seniors, said to appeal to more Canadians, Carney would be wise to sport a more laid back tone, as he did in his unofficial campaign launch on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ""He should be relaxed. I think he has a natural whit. I think he's funny. He needs to sort of just allow himself to be himself."" For others like Myrla Savet, who acknowledges she is a ""little bit"" worried about how Carney will fare on the campaign trail, she is banking on hope. ""Hopefully people will see that despite the fact that he does not have the political chops yet, that his expertise will carry him through.""

"Three people Carney should thank: Freeland, Poilievre and Trump:   Long poised for a quick march to electoral oblivion, the Liberals now stand on the precipice of a fourth mandate",2025.0,"No success was ever achieved without the help of others. Oh sure, winners always thank the usual suspects: supportive family, diligent staff, long-suffering spouse. But nobody ever salutes the players who never intended to offer an assist – yet did. Three key actors deserve major credit for Mark Carney’s election as Liberal Leader and prime minister-designate – and for the fact that his party, long poised for a quick march into electoral oblivion, now stands on the precipice of a fourth mandate. Chrystia Freeland : Mr. Carney might still be enjoying a richly compensated life in the master of the universe division of the private sector, and still pondering whether to enter Canadian politics, were it not for what Ms. Freeland, then the finance minister and deputy prime minister, did on the morning of Dec. 16, 2024. Her resignation letter’s line about ""costly political gimmicks"" summed up the feelings of a lot of voters and struck like a stiletto to the heart of government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau never was able to stanch the bleeding. Three weeks later, the leadership race began. As often happens in business, an innovative first-mover set a new dynamic in motion, only to have a later arrival reap the rewards. Donald Trump: Even before his return to the White House, the U.S. President started threatening our economy and our existence. The country sees itself as in peril, and it is in peril. That has remade Canadian politics. As Ontario Premier Doug Ford just demonstrated – turning a provincial election into a referendum on ""who’s gonna fight for you?"" – the threat from south of the border is now the No. 1 issue for Canadians. The U.S. chief executive is a menace to Canada. But danger is also a political opportunity for Mr. Carney and the Liberals. Canadian politicians must walk a fine line. They must stand up for Canada, and when Mr. Trump hits, they have to hit back. But they must also be very careful about who they’re hitting, and who they’re chirping. The master at this has been Mr. Ford. He’s talked the toughest on tariffs, including in a series of appearances on U.S. TV. But he always says, again and again, that he loves our neighbours, he wishes the two countries could have an even closer relationship, and this fight isn’t with all Americans, but with just one American. Mr. Carney went over the line in his acceptance speech on Sunday night, when he described the U.S. as ""a country we can no longer trust."" That may turn out be true, but for now, it’s the wrong message. Our aim is for Americans to come to their senses and see things as we do, not rally around the flag. And for at least the next four years, the one problematic American will be in power, and will need to be negotiated with. Canada’s actions must be firm – elbows up? Yup! – but our leaders have to be mindful of what they say. As every Canadian hockey player knows, let your game do the talking, and keep it respectful off the ice. Pierre Poilievre: By upending Canadian politics, Mr. Trump stole certain electoral victory from the Conservative Leader. But with his promises of ""putting more money in your pocket"" and building pipelines, Mr. Carney’s platform has also stolen from the Conservatives. In fact, Mr. Carney and the Liberals have effectively co-opted three out of four of Mr. Poilievre’s marquee slogans. ""Axe the Tax?"" Mr. Poilievre spent the last two years beating the Liberals with that popular demand. Mr. Carney borrowed it and made it the centrepiece of his leadership campaign. ""Fix the Budget?"" Mr. Carney has a different idea of how to do it, which may involve a certain degree of sleight of hand, by dividing the budget into operating and investment accounts. Nonetheless, Mr. Carney’s repeated statements that Canada ""needs to spend less"" while ""investing more,"" is a Liberal take on a popular Conservative talking point. ""Build the Homes?"" The Liberals lifted that from Mr. Poilievre more than a year ago. The last unappropriated Conservative slogan is ""Stop the Crime"" – and Mr. Carney would be wise to appropriate it, too. Post-Trudeau Liberals should eagerly agree with Canadians (and disagree with the worst of Liberal progressive impulses) that crime is a problem, full stop. Don’t add a ""but … ."" Don’t try to change the topic to ""systemic something-something."" Do offer different, better answers than the Conservatives. Edmonton: If Mr. Carney wants to swing for the political fences (and thank the city where he was raised), he should run in Edmonton. Maybe Edmonton West – it was a Liberal seat in the Jean Chrétien era, and Mr. Carney’s old high school is in the riding – or perhaps Edmonton Mill Woods, won for the Liberals by Edmonton Mayor Amarjeet Sohi in 2015. Of course, if the Liberals fail to win nationally, Mr. Carney will likely lose in Edmonton, too. With no seat and no government to lead, he could honourably exit politics as quickly as he entered. But what if a Liberal prime minister dared to run in Alberta? What if he won a seat in Alberta? What if he served as a Liberal PM – from Alberta? Imagine that.

"Liberals rush to move past Trudeau while Poilievre wants to look back:   As new Liberal Leader Mark Carney pushes a new election around managing the country through the Trump years, his main electoral opponent seems reluctant to adjust",2025.0,"Things are in flux in Ottawa. When will Mark Carney call an election? ""That will be up to the new boss,"" Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon replied. Liberals’ eyes turned so quickly from Justin Trudeau to Mr. Carney that the technicalities were ignored. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly not only declared a ""new era is starting,"" but referred to Mr. Trudeau as ""our former prime minister."" Yet Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre sounded like he didn’t want the Prime Minister to go. He held a news conference on Parliament Hill that did a lot of looking back. All of his lines of attack about Mr. Carney – except for one – were more or less about Mr. Trudeau’s record, as if Mr. Poilievre had invested so much in slogans aimed at Mr. Trudeau that he couldn’t afford to ditch them. Maybe that’s just an effort to seize the last day or two when Mr. Trudeau is still PM and in the same room, and the same camera frame, as Mr. Carney, to tie the two together. But Mr. Carney is pushing the next election, probably less than two weeks away, around getting Canada through the next four years of U.S. President Donald Trump. The new Liberal Leader is rushing to be sworn in quickly and trigger a campaign, and the issues Canadians worry about have shifted. Mr. Poilievre seems reluctant to adjust to that. It’s as if he sees responding to new political circumstances as a weakness. It’s not that he still insists a carbon-levy election is coming, it’s that he seems to take offence at the suggestion that that might not be the ballot question, as if changes in the political landscape are a personal insult. You can see why Mr. Poilievre would argue, as he started to yesterday, that Mr. Carney is trying to distract from the Liberal record in government by talking about Mr. Trump. After all, it’s true. That’s pretty much the whole reason Liberals chose Mr. Carney as their leader: because he wasn’t in Mr. Trudeau’s government, and because the former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England has a résumé and style that give him the look and feel of someone who could manage through a made-in-Trump world economic crisis. Mr. Carney is going to be banging that drum till voting day. So yes, the Conservative Leader is obviously going to have to run against the Liberal economic record. But he’s also going to have to take aim at Mr. Carney’s economic plans, because voters tend to think about the future. That’s why it was strange that Mr. Poilievre scrambled to throw everything at him. He claimed Mr. Carney is ""trying to distract from his many scandals and conflicts of interest,"" which haven’t surfaced yet, anyway. Why throw an obstacle in the way when you are trying to get everyone to focus on the Liberal record on the economy? There is that one line of attack that has some real bite – that Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. recently moved its headquarters to New York while Mr. Carney was chair. It runs embarrassingly against the current wave of nationalist sentiment and relates to the Tories’ effort to keep pointing out that the new Liberal Leader is a wealthy man who doesn’t have to worry about the price of groceries. It’s fair, too, for Mr. Poilievre to point out that Mr. Carney’s plan to scrap the fuel charge – also known as the consumer carbon tax – means beefing up the carbon-levy regime for industrial emitters. But it still sounds ridiculous because Mr. Poilievre still won’t say if Conservatives would keep industrial carbon levies. It’s not strange that the Conservative Leader doesn’t want to abandon affordability and tax cuts as his central issues. Mr. Poilievre has tax cuts imprinted in his system. There is still widespread anxiety about the cost of living. Focusing on that made Mr. Poilievre the front-runner to win the next election – and he still is. But worry about what Mr. Trump means for Canada’s economy is real. Polls suggest it now tops the list of Canadians’ concerns. Every party’s economic agenda has to succeed on that ground, because that’s what Canadians fear for their future. And Mr. Poilievre still sounds strangely like he doesn’t want to go there.

"In Mark Carney, Liberals bet on a technocrat to weather turbulence with Trump:   Carney already sounds as though he will run not as the incumbent but as opposition to Pierre Poilievre on the issue of leading the economy in the face of a trade war with the U.S.",2025.0,"Mark Carney was anointed as much as elected. Canadian politics had gathered currents that pushed Liberals to want a different kind of leader: a technocrat to steer away from Justin Trudeau and through troubled times. The result was overwhelming. Mr. Trudeau’s former deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, was brushed aside brutally, into a second-place finish that amounted to 8 per cent of the vote. Mr. Carney won in a blow-out with 86 per cent. The Liberals’ two-month leadership race was a quickie remodel, and the party was in a rush to tear down the Trudeau structures and put up something that looks like it can withstand the winds of Hurricane Donald Trump. That’s what Mr. Carney talked about when he won. He claimed to be the candidate of change by highlighting a promised to cancel two of Mr. Trudeau’s policies – the carbon levy and capital-gains tax increase – while Mr. Trudeau was sitting right in front of him. He talked about tax cuts and economic competitiveness in very un-Trudeau ways. Then he spent much his victory speech warning Mr. Trump’s designs on Canada – ""our resources, our water, our land, our country"" – and offered a technocrat’s swagger about his ability to cope with them. ""I know how the world works,"" he said. ""And I know how it can be made to work better for all of us."" Mr. Carney is now a man in a hurry. He will probably be sworn in as prime minister before the end of the week. He will probably trigger a snap election within two weeks. In his leadership-campaign rallies, and in his victory speech, he has asked Liberals the same pep-talk question: ""Who’s ready?"" Now it’s something of a slogan for a new Liberal Leader who will struggling to mount a campaign within days. And still, most Canadians don’t really know much about who he is. At 59, Mr. Carney is famous, world-famous even, among that thin tranche of the world who might know who a star central banker is. But as a politician, and the next prime minister, he is largely an unknown. He will take power as prime minister having never been elected to public office. He won a short two-month leadership campaign that included a smattering of policy, but hardly gave Canadians a feeling for his personality. But this leadership was not a search for an inspiration. Mr. Trudeau won the 2013 Liberal leadership promising to build common ground among Canadians. Mr. Carney’s victory was the inexorable advance of the candidate with the resumé Liberals wanted: a big-name outsider with experience as a crisis economic manager. The Conservatives can – and have – called him ""just like Justin."" But aside from policy change, Mr. Carney doesn’t come off anything like. This leader doesn’t glow in rallies. He speaks slowly, usually in wonk-ish terms. Even celebrating victory, his speech didn’t have an excess of zing. Mr. Carney sells competence for worrying times. The fact that polls suggested that image would put the Liberals into a neck-and-neck with Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives turned that in a landslide rout. It’s obvious that Mr. Carney will take that mandate and try to win an election campaign on the issue that helped him to that victory: the anxiety Canadians feel over Mr. Trump’s tariff threats. Everyone who spoke at the Liberal leadership event Sunday made that the only issue. Mr. Trudeau did, in a goodbye speech that was more pep talk than retrospective. So did 91-year-old Jean Chrétien, in a speech that mixed retrospection with nationalistic blasts at Mr. Trump. Mr. Carney, the soon-to-be prime minister, already sounds as though he will run not as the incumbent, but as opposition to Mr. Poilievre on the issue of leading the economy in the face of Mr. Trump’s trade war. That bit of swagger about knowing how the world works came with lines about Mr. Poilievre being an ideologue who worships free markets even though he’d never made a payroll – and accusing the Conservative Leader of sharing Mr. Trump’s views. ""A person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him,"" Mr. Carney said. That is the job Liberals hired him for. Like most Canadians, they don’t know a lot about Mr. Carney. They might know a few of his proposals, but they don’t really have a sense of the instincts that would drive him in leading the country. But he couldn’t be stopped. Liberals hired his resumé to make the case he can deal with Mr. Trump – and win an election on it.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday temporarily removing tariffs that he imposed only two days earlier. The order applies to goods from Canada that are compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), which covers a significant portion of Canadian exports to the U.S. The order also lowers the tariff on potash, which is used in fertilizer, from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. Mr. Trump also said he still plans to push ahead with 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum, scheduled to take effect on March 12. It is the latest shift in a constantly changing trade policy that has left Canadian businesses, Ottawa and the provinces unsure of what comes next, Steven Chase, Mark Rendell and Bill Curry report. Pierre Poilievre’s disdain for big business is creating an uneasy relationship with corporate Canada Pierre Poilievre has an unconventional, fraught, at times even hostile relationship with the business leaders who make up Canada’s corporate power centre, James Bradshaw and Andrew Willis report. The Conservative leader has shown a distinct lack of interest in, and respect for, the finance crowd – and openly challenges the clubby relationship that existed between CEOs and previous Conservative leaders. Another factor that could spell trouble is Mark Carney, if he becomes Liberal leader, and his close Bay Street ties. The Globe and Mail interviewed nearly 30 senior people in business and political roles about Mr. Poilievre’s uneasy relationship with corporate Canada and what he would mean for Canadian business. Here’s what they had to say. Decoder: European stocks are the hot trade of 2025 U.S. stocks, which had been trading at lofty valuations, have been dinged in recent weeks by tepid economic data and fears of an AI bubble.

Seven &amp; i Holdings, however, has consistently tried to fend off the foreign takeover bid. This week alone, the Japanese company appointed its first foreign chief executive, sold its superstore unit, announced plans for a major share buyback and said it would list its North American convenience stores in an initial public offering by the end of 2026.

"'Knock it of,f ' Poilievre tells Trump in rare rebuke",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre on Friday issued his sternest message yet to U.S. President Donald Trump, as the question of who is best suited to handle Trump's threats emerges as the defining issue of the next election. Poilievre seemed to acknowledge the cultural and political moment he and the country are in when he began his news conference Friday by offering some direct words to Trump, before taking aim at Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney. ""My message to the president is this: Knock if off. Stop the chaos. You are hurting your workers, your consumers and most immediately destroying trillions of dollars of wealth on your own stock market. ""You're attacking a cherished friend of the United States and you're strengthening America's enemies by going after America's friends."" It marked one of the first times Poilievre has so directly taken aim at Trump. Even before Canadians felt the sting of Trump's tariffs, Liberals and other critics of the Conservative leader have been drawing comparisons to his Republican counterpart. If he wins the leadership on Sunday, Carney plans to make that case to Canadians. He did so at a rally in Montreal Thursday, telling the crowd that Poilievre was not the right leader for the moment and accused him of worshipping Trump. Carney also challenged Poilievre's latest pitch to Canadians that he puts ""Can - ada First"" by contrasting it against his record of saying ""Canada is broken."" Poilievre has raised eyebrows in some Conservative circles over his support for retaliatory tariffs. In a sit-down last month with Candace Malcolm, the right-wing media host questioned Poilievre's support of hitting back at the U.S. with countermeasures. ""A tariff that Canada imposes is really just a 25 per cent tax on the goods that we import,"" Malcolm said. ""It's a 25 per cent tax on what Canadians pay for, so why is a Conservative leader agreeing with basically a 25 per cent Liberal tax increase?"" After disagreeing that he supports anything like a ""Liberal tax increase,"" Poilievre outlined that was why he said any tariff-related revenue must be put toward a tax cut. ""We have to defend our country and our industrial base if it comes under unfair and unprovoked attack by a foreign government and cut other taxes to neutralize the effect of that unfortunate, but unnecessary action.""

Poilievre vows to close 'Carney loophole'; Disclosure rules,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is promising to change the Conflict of Interest Act to force party leadership candidates to disclose financial holdings within a month of declaring their candidacy. The pledge comes after the opposition parties have accused Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney of exploiting a loophole in the Act that could allow him to become prime minister and run in an election without having disclosed his financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest. ""You have to ask yourself, for whose benefit is the prime minister of Canada actually working?"" said Poilievre at a press conference in Toronto Friday. ""Mr. Carney could win the Liberal leadership and become prime minister without revealing to Canadians his massive, multi-million dollar foreign holdings."" Under the change proposed by Poilievre, leadership candidates would have to disclose any financial holdings to the ethics commissioner within 30 days and make them publicly available in 60 days. The Conservatives also promised to force future prime ministers and ministers to sell assets that create conflicts of interest. Currently, only elected officials have to share this information with the ethics commissioner within 60 days; it becomes public in another 60 days. Carney, a former Bank of Canada governor, has never been elected and doesn't have to make such disclosures. If he wins the Liberal leadership on Sunday and becomes prime minister, he will have to comply with the Conflict of Interest Act. But the Conservatives point out the timeline could mean that Carney's public disclosures don't happen until after an election. Carney has indicated that if he wins the leadership, he may call a federal election within weeks. A spokesperson for Carney said he would ""not merely comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines, but surpass them. ""The office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has already been contacted ahead of time to help ensure all appropriate steps can be initiated right away, and assets would be immediately placed in a blind trust,"" said Liam Roche in a statement. But Poilievre warned Friday that under the current rules, Carney could place his investments in a blind trust while maintaining all the same holdings, giving him full knowledge of his own investments and raising the possibility of conflicts. The Conservative leader also called on Carney to voluntary disclose his financial holdings immediately. ""Within four days we will have a new prime minister who will be negotiating with president Trump and that incoming prime minister refuses to tell Canadians where his millions of dollars are invested and, therefore, where his real interests lie,"" said Poilievre.

'Knock it off'; Poilievre sports tougher tone against Trump,2025.0,"OTTAWA . Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre delivered his sternest message yet to U.S. President Donald Trump, as the question of who is best suited to handle his threats quickly becomes the defining issue of the next election. Poilievre walked through a column of 13 Canadian flags to reach his podium on Friday at a moment when millions of Canadians are seeing red over Trump. Anger is brewing not only because of Trump's imposition of 25 per cent tariffs, which he paused on Thursday until next month, save for the levies on steel and aluminum coming next week, but also Trump's attitude toward Canada, which can be summed up by his repeated desire for it to become a state. Trump's hostility has led to a resurgence of national pride, with consumers declining to buy American goods and fans booing the U.S. anthem in sports arenas. Even the man behind the fictional ""Joe Canada"" from a Molson Canadian beer commercial two decades ago resurrected the role to give Canadians a rallying crying at a time they feel their sovereignty has been shaken. And against the backdrop of Trump, another revival is stirring. This time, a political one. With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his way out and former central banker Mark Carney expected to win the contest to replace him on Sunday, the Conservatives' year-and-a-half lead over the Liberals keeps narrowing, as Canadians are preoccupied with Trump. Poilievre acknowledged the moment the country finds itself in on Friday when he began by offering some direct words to the president himself, before taking aim at Carney. ""My message to the president is this: Knock it off. Stop the chaos. You are hurting your workers, your consumers and most immediately destroying trillions of dollars of wealth on your own stock market.

While the party sees some overlap between its supporters and Trump's, Poilievre was quick to embrace the president's message last week when Trump told a British magazine he did not think too highly of the Canadian Conservative, saying Poilievre's biggest problem is that he isn't ""a MAGA guy."" Poilievre pointed to Trump's remark this week after Trump hit Canada with tariffs, saying ""it is true that I am Canada first."" ""I'm only for Canada, I'm fighting for the interest of this people and this country. And if that upsets foreign leaders, including the American president, I'm fine with that.""

Poilievre targets 'Carney loophole':   Conservative leader proposes ethics rule over financia l holdings,2025.0,"OTTAWAIn their latest shot at Liberal leadership contender Mark Carney, the federal Conservatives are promising to change Canada's ethics law to ensure those seeking to lead political parties publicly disclose their financial holdings. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Friday morning that, if elected, his government would change Canada's Conflict of Interest Act to close the ""Carney loophole"" and force future party leadership hopefuls to disclose their financial holdings to the federal ethics commissioner within 30 days of becoming a candidate. The candidate would then have to disclose their holdings to the public within 60 days. The Conservatives also want to change the rules to ensure future prime ministers and cabinet ministers sell off any assets they own that create a conflict of interest within 30 days of assuming their roles, Poilievre said. It's the latest attempt to pressure Carney, the former central banker in Canada and the United Kingdom, to disclose his financial assets before the Liberal leadership race ends on Sunday, as Poilievre's Conservatives criticize the perceived front-runner to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Carney committed this week to ""immediately"" put his holdings in a blind trust if he wins the leadership, but has so far not disclosed details of any financial assets and investments. At a press conference in Toronto, where his handlers cherry-picked which media outlets were allowed to ask questions, Poilievre said his proposed changes are necessary to prevent ""globalist"" interests from influencing Canada's leaders. ""Mr. Carney could win the Liberal leadership and become prime minister without revealing to Canadians his massive, multimillion dollar foreign holdings,"" Poilievre charged. ""He's being sneaky. He continues to hide. What is he hiding in all of these finances?"" Poilievre also suggested U.S. President Donald Trump will try to ""leverage"" any of Carney's financial interests abroad to press him to act ""against Canada."" As opposition leader, Poilievre has disclosed his holdings to the ethics commissioner. The online registry, last updated in June 2024, shows he had invested unspecified amounts in a series of exchange traded funds, two of which consist mostly of U.S. company stocks, while others are made up of shares in companies from Singapore, Switzerland, and in bitcoin. His office did not immediately respond to questions about these assets. In a statement to the Star Friday morning, Carney's campaign accused Poilievre of failing to focus on ""the real issues facing Canadians,"" such as U.S. President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs against Canada. ""Since U.S. tariffs came into effect Tuesday, Pierre Poilievre has mentioned Mark Carney's name 10 times on the same social media account, and Donald Trump's name not even once,"" the statement said. ""While Pierre Poilievre is worried about facing Mark Carney, Mark is staying focused on Canadians and building the best economy in the G7."" For weeks, the Conservatives have repeatedly demanded that Carney disclose his assets after a career as a central banker and top executive for companies like Brookfield Asset Management, payment processor Stripe, and business media empire Bloomberg. The opposition party has demanded that Carney - the perceived front-runner to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - should disclose all his assets immediately, branding him as ""sneaky"" and raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Earlier this week, in response to questions about his financial holdings from the Star, Carney's campaign said they have already been in contact with the federal ethics commissioner. If he wins the leadership race, Carney would ""immediately"" place all his assets in a blind trust, removing him from control over his holdings, the campaign said. Though Carney's campaign did not disclose information about his holdings, publicly available data shows he held more than $3 million in Brookfield shares as of the end of 2023, based on stock prices this week, with options to buy millions of dollars more at discounted prices. In an open letter to Carney on Thursday, Conservative MP Michael Barrett alleged the leadership contender was doing the ""bare minimum"" by committing to put his assets in a blind trust. ""It is unclear whether some of your non-stock assets at Brookfield could even be placed into a blind trust, as you already know what the funds are invested in. Full divestment might well be your only option,"" Barrett wrote. The NDP has also challenged Carney over his work at Brookfield, where he was board chair. New Democrat MP Niki Ashton raised concerns about alleged tax avoidance, which the company has previously denied.

The difference between Ford and Poilievre:   Pollster David Coletto on crunching the numbers from the Ontario election and the premier's signature achievement,2025.0,"Politicians always say that campaigns matter. Pollsters know better. In truth, Ontario's Feb. 27 vote resembled a Holiday Inn election, a ""no surprises"" campaign from beginning to end - not least because public opinion surveys called it from start to finish. One of those prescient pollsters was Abacus Data CEO David Coletto, whose surveys appear regularly in the Toronto Star. He tracked the issues that matter most to voters - and thus to politicians. Public opinion polling doesn't just hold up a mirror to society, allowing voters to see the lay of the land. Polls are also used by political parties to mine the data points, connect the dots and plot their campaign strategies - for better or for worse. The Star spoke with Coletto about why politicians said what they said on the campaign trail, what got through to voters - and what didn't. He also explains how Premier Doug Ford figured out how to connect the dots and connect with voters, doubtless thanks to his own internal polling results. A lot of people like me worry that polling is broken, but pollsters got a lot more right than you got wrong in this election. What was different this time? Well, let me first challenge the premise. Most of the time, the polls get it right. Sometimes low turnout can be a problem for us in terms of who actually shows up to vote, but despite very low turnout this time, the polls were accurate. Fair enough, and that's an admirable defence of the art and science of polling. But tell me why this particular campaign was both so stable and so predictable. The campaign, in a way, almost didn't matter, because Donald Trump and his threat of tariffs and annexing the country just loomed so large. And so we didn't see a lot of movement throughout the campaign. It basically ended where it started. Where it mattered more was probably with how the Liberals ended up doing in terms of their increased popular vote. Opposition leaders in Ontario get so little attention compared to federal politics. But it's part of their job description to become better known. How did they do, and what could they have done differently? That's a very tough thing, right? You had Donald Trump, you have a media market - beyond the Toronto Star - that doesn't cover provincial politics as much. One of the untold stories of this campaign was how much more money the Progressive Conservatives had, how much advertising they did before the writ was dropped. I think the campaign did change some people's opinions - it raised the profile of health care. Incumbents did very well in this campaign, and that really helped the New Democrats, who surprised everybody by seeing their vote drop substantially yet only lose two seats overall (down four seats compared to the 2022 election). So the NDP held on to second place in seats but fell to a distant third in the popular vote. Yet they kept introducing their leader, Marit Stiles, as the next NDP premier. That didn't happen. Is it ever going to happen? Is there a ceiling on any NDP government in Ontario? There is. Pollsters like me use the term ""accessible voter pool"" - those who say they're open to voting for a party - and the NDP is the smallest. Their vote dropped substantially. They made no progress in positioning themselves as a government in waiting, despite being official Opposition for two terms and now a third term. Is there any real difference between the various political parties? Or is it more about personality and geography than ideology? There's still partisanship built into this, which is different from ideology. It's also identity. If aliens landed in Ontario they wouldn't see a lot of difference. But that would miss decades of history pitting New Democrats against Liberals who insist they are nothing like each other. The NDP was hurt by the weakness of the federal NDP and (Liberal Leader) Bonnie Crombie benefited by the renewal of the federal brand. Looking at your polling data, the best way for Doug Ford to attract votes - and distract voters from a legacy of scandals - was to talk about the economy and affordability where he is seen as stronger. Which is mostly what he did, right? Doug Ford did something in this election that almost no incumbent anywhere has been able to do at a time when the cost of living and inflation and affordability have been the primary focus for voters. Ford's brand is built around the idea that he looks out for the interests of that little person or that average worker in this province. We had seen in the polling we'd done for the Star that he was very vulnerable on the question of using taxpayers' money responsibly, and allegations of corruption. Yet it almost didn't matter to those voters, because they believed he was on their side. And that's a really powerful force in politics. The Liberals and NDP also stressed pocketbook politics but it was hard to tell them apart. Yet the Tories gained traction. So voters found Ford more believable on affordability? Yeah that's true. Doug Ford's brand is that he wakes up every morning ... trying to make sure the taxpayers are respected. But during the campaign, it felt like an arms race on who could make our lives more affordable - whether it was the grocery rebate from the New Democrats or taking the tolls off the 407, and the Liberal tax cuts. It was clear that they were reading the polls like everybody else, and that was the number one issue for people. Why would the other parties fall over themselves to cut taxes and tolls if that's just playing to Ford's advantage? Tell me the truth - is it absolutely impossible to get elected today without talking like a tax cutter and a toll cutter? It's really hard to do. A lot of the public today has a what I call a scarcity mindset. The things they need in their life are getting more expensive. The NDP's toll and rebate strategy clearly didn't really work, it didn't offer up something different. I look at the NDP campaign and ask: What was it about? You don't want to fight on the same battlefield where your opponent is stronger. What message should Doug Ford take from the numbers? If I'm Doug Ford, I look at this and I say, I haven't been punished for not delivering (and) spending a billion-plus dollars to end the beer monopoly or all the questions around the Greenbelt. Since you raised it, Doug Ford seems obsessed about beer, even though he doesn't drink. He wasted a lot of time and money on this issue. Why bother with booze if it doesn't boost his vote? Booze is a quintessential Ford issue. Even though he doesn't drink any of the stuff, it's one of those issues that signals to his voters that he understands them. It's not grand public policy, but it differentiates him so that people can say, ""Well, that's Doug Ford. I know what he stands for."" It reinforced the image of a guy who gets their lives. It's a cultural signal to those voters. What is it about Ford's persona that drives so many people crazy? When he told me in the 2022 campaign that he'd ""evolved"" after the pandemic - which, ah, he did - there was a lot of pushback. Now that he's won three elections, people aren't as incredulous. But there's something about Ford's success and style that makes people's heads explode. Why? It's a head scratcher. Lots of Ontarians look at his record and say, ""What's there to like, what's his signature achievement?"" But what he's done, which is similar to Trump, is build an affinity with enough people - that's the key word, affinity - that's personal. Post-pandemic and during the pandemic, he broke free from ideological constraints and became a Doug Ford Conservative. He is able to run massive deficits. He is able to apologize and change course. His approach to building relationships is very transactional ... He's the complete opposite of (federal Tory Leader) Pierre Poilievre, right? I think the reason they don't get along is because they are fundamentally different people. Different styles. It's not part of Poilievre's persona to give out his cellphone number, right? Maybe that's the most important thing about Doug Ford: The perception of his accessibility to everyone.

How Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives are preparing to go up against a new Liberal leader:   Tories have amassed research on front-runner Mark Carney to undercut his narrative of being a capable economic steward during difficult times,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre heads to London, Ont., on Sunday for a rally just hours before the Liberals elect their new leader. It’s in battleground regions such as Southwestern Ontario where the Conservatives need to pick up seats to win government, a victory that this past fall seemed all but certain until a series of political dominoes fell over and created a whole new political game. When Mr. Poilievre won leadership in the fall of 2022, the minority Liberals were propped up by the New Democrats and the next election was set for this October. For the first two years of his leadership, Mr. Poilievre drove the party to a double-digit lead over the Liberals under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. That all began to unravel in September. The Liberal-NDP deal was ripped up. Liberal MPs began agitating for Mr. Trudeau to quit. Chrystia Freeland, the Finance Minister, quit her post. Then, Mr. Trudeau declared his intention to resign, proroguing Parliament and in turn began the race to replace him. Now, should front-runner Mark Carney be victorious on Sunday, an election call is expected by midmonth. The campaign will take place against the backdrop of the trade war with the United States and polling that shows a bounce for the incumbent Liberals. How the Conservatives will strategically navigate it all is how political parties always must grapple with things, said Garry Keller, a long-time Conservative strategist who is a vice-president at StrategyCorp. ""As political parties, when you’re working in a war room or working on a campaign, you deal with what you can control,"" he said. That’s why in the past week Conservatives began starting up their campaign war room, bringing in operatives and strategists to start laying the groundwork on day-to-day election plans and messaging. And it’s also why ads for the Conservatives are inescapable on radio, television and online – the party spent at least $130,000 on Facebook ads alone between Feb. 28 and March 3. More ads are coming. The party raised $41-million raised in 2024, and will race to spend as much as they can before election spending limits kick in. ""The Conservative Party will be ready for whenever the election is called with a full bank account and a full slate of candidates,"" said party spokesperson Sarah Fischer in an e-mail. The Liberal race – along with Mr. Trump – has sucked up a lot of political oxygen. The tariff war in particular has seen the Conservative message often pushed aside for coverage of the power brokers of the day. But the end of the leadership contest brings the next election into sharper focus, said Mr. Keller. ""It becomes a very clear binary choice for undecided voters, and I think in some ways, the Conservatives will welcome that, because it becomes very clear to the public what is being offered."" With that battle expected to be with Mr. Carney, Conservative operatives have worked to amass research on him to deploy over the course of a general campaign as they seek to undercut Mr. Carney’s narrative of being a capable economic steward during difficult times. One piece surfaced during the leadership race – documents showing Mr. Carney, in his capacity as chair of the board of Brookfield Asset Management, presided over that company’s decision to move its headquarters from Toronto to New York. Mr. Carney had claimed otherwise after the leadership debate, but the next morning, the Conservatives popped up with a paper trail to say otherwise. Mr. Carney’s campaign chalked the episode up to Mr. Poilievre being afraid of him. That Mr. Carney can’t be trusted to do that will be a part of Mr. Poilievre’s message. Even as Mr. Carney is making promises similar to Mr. Poilievre’s – the end of the consumer carbon price and a rollback of capital gains changes – Mr. Poilievre will make the case that Canadians can’t believe he’ll follow through. Another key message: Mr. Carney isn’t a change. ""After three terms in office and 10 years of making Canada weak, the Carney Trudeau Liberals want us to give them a fourth kick at the can. Sorry, three strikes and you are out,"" Mr. Poilievre told reporters at a news conference on Friday. ""We need someone else to hit the ball, and we need to take back control of our economic destiny."" To that, Mr. Carney is planning to answer: That person, at this time, is not Mr. Poilievre. Joseph Lavoie, a partner at Crestview Strategy, recently watched 65 of Mr. Poilievre’s speeches over a two-year period to analyze his communications strategy. He said he took away was the themes of Mr. Poilievre’s core messages on the economy, affordability and public safety are flexible enough to adapt – even with a new Liberal leader and in the Trump tariff era. ""Core to the themes that Pierre Poilievre has focused on since he launched his leadership is the concept of self-resilience and making Canada stronger. On a fundamental level, the values driving that focus have not changed in the face of Trump’s tariffs,"" said Mr. Lavoie, who worked for the last Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper. As Canadians have rallied around the flag in the wake of those tariffs, Mr. Poilievre has too, reframing his message under the banner of ""Canada First,"" Mr. Lavoie noted – it just might take a couple of weeks for voters to connect those dots. ""As he starts to fill in the colours of his refreshed outline, I suspect he will recapture some of the swing voters who may have had a temporary reaction to the tariff issue.""

Corporate Canada sizes up Poilievre’s disdain for big business,2025.0,"On the 34th floor of First Canadian Place, the BMO-branded tower at the core of corporate Canada’s Bay Street hub, a distinctly downtown crowd of about 150 people gathered to get a glimpse of Pierre Poilievre. Law firm Bennett Jones hosted the fundraiser. Robert Staley – a close ally of the Conservative leader and chair of the party’s powerful fundraising arm – is the firm’s vice-chair and a partner. Other hosts included Scotiabank vice-chair Mark Mulroney, son of a former prime minister, health care services executive Shaun Francis of Medcan Health Management and former Assante Wealth Management CEO Joe Canavan. The price of admission was $1,750 per head to hear “Pierre share his common sense vision for Canada,” as the party had advertised it. For Mr. Poilievre, gatherings like this over his first two years as party leader were unremarkable events ahead of what was expected to be a cake walk of an election against Justin Trudeau. The stakes rose when the Prime Minister decided to resign, U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war and Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney emerged as a viable answer to the question: Who is best equipped to deal with Mr. Trump? Many of the executives shaking Mr. Poilievre’s hands on this evening were back-slapping with Mr. Carney, and handing him cheques, at a fundraiser the previous week. The cake walk has become a horse race. And losing a contest he seemed all but certain to win would likely see Mr. Poilievre put out to pasture, just like his past two predecessors. As guests sipped Oyster Bay Chardonnay, Mr. Poilievre delivered a familiar stump speech, according to four sources who attended the event in late February. He promised to lower taxes, make Canada more competitive, and get things done faster. He took shots at Mr. Carney for being “just like Justin” – and for moving Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.‘s head office to New York when he was its board chair. And he made a few remarks about the looming threats from the United States on tariffs. When one executive in the crowd – William Cheng, owner of a Mississauga company that makes candles – said he would consider moving his factory and its 500 employees to avoid tariffs, Mr. Poilievre urged him not to give up on Canada just yet, and said he would create a more welcoming environment for entrepreneurs, sources who witnessed the exchange said. On the event’s sidelines, Mr. Poilievre chatted with top business executives, including Edward Rogers, the executive chair of Rogers Communications Inc. and scion of the family that controls the telecommunications giant. But sources in attendance said his remarks to the larger group lacked specific details about the Conservatives’ plan for business and the economy, or for winning a trade war with Mr. Trump. The evening was hardly a lovein, and had more of an atmosphere of an obligatory gathering of extended family, sources who were in the room said. But neither did Mr. Poilievre antagonize the business leaders, as he has in the past. At another time, with another Conservative candidate, none of this would be especially noteworthy. But Mr. Poilievre has an unconventional, fraught, at times even hostile relationship with the business leaders who make up Canada’s corporate power centre. He openly challenges the clubby relationship that existed between CEOs and previous Conservative leaders. He has shown a distinct lack of interest in, and respect for, the finance crowd. In December, 2023, Mr. Poilievre started a lunch speech to bankers and fund managers at downtown Toronto’s C.D. Howe Institute by saying, “I almost never speak to crowds in downtown Toronto or anywhere close to Bay Street.” With Mr. Poilievre still considered the frontrunner to be Canada’s prime minister after the next federal election campaign, business leaders are struggling to understand what to expect if he wins – and the extent to which some of them could end up in his crosshairs one day. The Globe and Mail interviewed nearly 30 senior people in business and political roles about what Prime Minister Poilievre would mean for Canadian business. The Globe is not identifying most of those sources as they feared professional repercussions for speaking out about him. Some of Mr. Poilievre’s policy positions are familiar hallmarks of Conservative orthodoxy. He leans toward free markets, blaming obstacles such as high taxes and overregulation for getting in the way of entrepreneurs and investors whose risk-taking creates jobs and raises wages for workers. In general, business leaders welcome those instincts. In other respects, he is a breed of Conservative leader that the country’s business elite has rarely encountered. Mr. Poilievre has almost no connections to the business world. He has spent his entire career in politics, serving as an MP since 2004, when he was 25 years old. His lone brush with work in the corporate world was a job working the phones to do corporate collections for Telus as a teenager. As a parliamentarian, Mr. Poilievre earned a reputation as an attack dog, and the instincts he honed are still on display. He spent time as the Conservative finance critic, where business sources say he gained a good grasp of the financial sector, but always through a political lens. Mr. Poilievre thinks the leaders of big companies don’t understand how government works, and is skeptical of what he sees as an ineffective, self-interested corporate culture that is out of touch with the needs of workers, sources said. Top business executives think Mr. Poilievre doesn’t understand big business, and won’t surround himself with many people who do, senior business sources said. Corporate leaders repeatedly said they are concerned he is too caught up in the cut-and-thrust of Question Period and catchy slogans like “Axe the Tax.” In public and in private, Mr. Poilievre is sharply critical of top executives and CEOs, “particularly a certain type of business leader, I might add – a more Bay Street, corporate, Toronto-centric type of business leader,” said Ginny Roth, a partner at Crestview Strategy who served as Mr. Poilievre’s communications director when he ran for the Conservative leadership. In an opinion piece in the National Post last May, Mr. Poilievre chastised “gutless executives” and their circuit of “pointless luncheons and meetings,” saying there was no guarantee that “businesses will get their way” from a Poilievre government. People close to Mr. Poilievre still point to the article as a window into his thinking, and a road map for how to interact with him. “If you do have a policy proposal, don’t tell me about it. Convince Canadians that it’s good for them. Communicate your policy’s benefits directly to workers, consumers and retirees,” he wrote. He loudly blames big corporations and their leaders for staying silent when Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government made missteps, and even cozying up to the government to win its support and subsidies. Mr. Poilievre and his team are particularly critical of businesses for what they see as selfserving lobbying in pursuit of corporate handouts. As one friend in Conservative politics put it: “Pierre’s superpower is not caring what Bay Street thinks of him.” “When Poilievre thinks about solutions – like lowering taxes, and deregulation and all kinds of policy-making questions – he’s not terribly interested in spending all his time talking to those people,” Ms. Roth said. On Friday, in a statement to The Globe and Mail, Mr. Poilievre’s director of media relations Sebastian Skamski said: “Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has crossed the country meeting tens of thousands of everyday Canadian workers across hundreds of businesses, factories, shop floors, mines, mills and plants spreading his message of powerful paycheques and lower taxes to unleash the full force of our economy and production.” “If business leaders are interested in creating more jobs and higher wages for Canadians, common sense Conservatives are willing to listen,” said Mr. Skamski in an e-mail. Former prime minister Stephen Harper was not especially close to major business leaders, and his finance minister Jim Flaherty occasionally took them to task in public. But Mr. Poilievre’s critiques have a harder edge. CEOs who have raised money for him say the elbows-up style is something business leaders need to get used to. “Does Pierre understand the challenges facing business, like a lack of investment, weak productivity and too much red tape? He 100 per cent does,” said Dan Daviau, chairman and CEO of investment bank Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. “Will 100 per cent of business leaders be comfortable with how he plans to tackle these challenges? Hard to say, as Pierre represents fundamental change and change sometimes is hard on the status quo.” Contrast that with Mr. Carney, the would-be Liberal leader, who arrives on the scene with longestablished ties in the top ranks of business, and is casting himself as a political outsider. Many of the executives shaking Mr. Poilievre’s hand are also back-slapping at Liberal events and donating to the former central banker. Across a string of fund raisers from both parties, executives have been taking the measure of both politicians. The event at First Canadian Place was one of three that Mr. Poilievre attended in Toronto that week, with another at the Lambton Golf & Country Club, and a third at Mr. Daviau’s Yorkville home. On March 11, executives from toy maker Spin Master Corp. plan to host another soiree in midtown Toronto. Executives meeting Mr. Poilievre for the first time have said he’s hard to like, and even harder to read. Several bankers and lawyers say they have met the Conservative leader on multiple occasions, but still have no clear sense of what makes him tick. His populist messaging, which has focused on the country being “broken,” inevitably draws comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump. But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Poilievre shows almost no desire to surround himself with billionaires or top CEOs. And last week, Mr. Trump put some distance between the two men, saying that Mr. Poilievre’s “biggest problem is he’s not a MAGA guy.” Some sources who have seen Mr. Poilievre up close are more complimentary. They said he is the same in private as he is in public and his message is consistent, which makes him predictable. He consumes huge amounts of information, including reports from bank economists, and sometimes calls the authors to discuss them further. He is said to be intellectually curious, has a good command of facts, and does his homework, the sources said. He has no problem with CEOs offering ideas and advice, they said. But he is deeply frustrated with chief executives who are, in his eyes, too risk-averse and meek, tiptoeing around and trying to avoid causing offense. He is irked when corporate leaders take selfies with Mr. Trudeau, even as they trash the Liberal prime minister in private, one source said. “If business leaders do have creative ideas that don’t involve either protection or spending, they should propose them. They should talk about them in public. They should convince people they’re a good idea,” Ms. Roth said. “And there’s no reason to believe he won’t listen.” Mr. Poilievre wants more blunt talk. He relishes it, enjoys it, and thinks that’s part of a healthy relationship, rather than damaging to relations, sources said. Charm, executives say, is not his style. That makes many among Canada’s business elite wary. They point to Mr. Poilievre’s response to a controversy when CTV News journalists edited a clip of him in a way that was misleading to viewers. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr. Poilievre took direct aim at Mirko Bibic, chief executive of Bell Canada, the network’s owner, calling him “an overpaid CEO” who “empties the books to pay his wealthy friends an unacceptably and unrealistically high dividend.” “He and his cronies at that company are going after me because they know that I am standing up for the people against the crony capitalists and insiders like them,” Mr. Poilievre said. Senior executives said they found the comments gratuitous and unnecessarily personal. They fear that Mr. Poilievre would turn on any CEO if it’s politically advantageous. In banking circles, Mr. Poilievre’s eleventh hour decision to oppose Royal Bank of Canada’s $13.5-billion takeover of HSBC Bank Canada was seen as an attempt to score political points. Executives from multiple banks said the Conservative leader only decided to say he would block the purchase 11 months after the deal was announced, so he could portray Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland as a friend of RBC when she approved the deal – which she did several weeks later. Bankers say Mr. Poilievre ignored the reality of the transaction, with London-based HSBC determined to leave the Canadian market. “If the wariness comes from a place of, he is going to be different, and he is not concerned with violating norms – particularly the norms of a cozy businessgovernment relationship – then that wariness is warranted,” Ms. Roth said. “But I don’t think that is cause for panic, or even really concern. I think the positive side for business is the guy is pretty easy to read.” It would be wrong to assume that Mr. Poilievre has no contact with business leaders. He meets with CEOs selectively. But most of the leading figures in Canadian business have never had a one-on-one conversation with a Conservative who has been in politics for more than two decades, sources said. A small circle of prominent business people have at least some access to the Conservative leader. Scotiabank’s Mr. Mulroney has helped build his profile by making introductions and raised money for his campaigns, as did Mr. Daviau. Billionaire Mattamy Homes founder Peter Gilgan, an entrepreneur with strong views on the housing shortage, hosted a fundraiser for Mr. Poilievre in his penthouse condominium. Tech-focused fund manager John Ruffolo, founder of Maverix Private Equity, and former Blackberry co-CEO Jim Balsillie are helping Mr. Poilievre come up with a strategy to encourage business investment and build the country’s digital economy. Shopify Inc. founder Tobi Lütke is swapping ideas on strengthening the tech sector with Mr. Poilievre, but one source said Mr. Lütke is keeping a low profile to avoid being cast as an Elon Musk-wannabe. A spokesperson for Shopify did not respond to a request for comment. The government relations machine has revved up in recent months, with companies flocking to other ex-Conservative ministers such as Lisa Raitt, James Moore and Rona Ambrose for advice on how to approach Mr. Poilievre. But sources cautioned that none of these people are especially close to Mr. Poilievre, after he remade the core of the Conservative party. The inner circle that surrounds Mr. Poilievre is small and closely guarded: It includes his top adviser, Jenni Byrne – a former chief of staff to Mr. Harper – as well as Mr. Staley from Bennett Jones and lawyer Michael Wilson of Goodmans LLP, a former chief of staff to Ontario’s attorney general. Sources said Mr. Poilievre also speaks regularly to Mr. Harper. Conservative MPs who play a key role on Mr. Poilievre’s team include Adam Chambers, a former executive at Canada Life Assurance Co. with a joint MBA-law degree, and Melissa Lantsman, who worked in communications at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Ltd. Both could be in line for key roles in a Conservative cabinet. Former Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is seen as a leading candidate to be Mr. Poilievre’s finance minister, sources said. Mr. Poilievre’s cabinet is unlikely to have much representation from people with deep business experience, as past finance ministers such as Liberal Bill Morneau and Conservatives Joe Oliver and Michael Wilson had – and that is by design. Most Canadians will be familiar with the broad strokes of Mr. Poilievre’s pitch to voters, encapsulated in pithy slogans: He will scrap the carbon tax, “fix” the federal budget, spur more home building and crack down on crime. The business elements of his platform in the upcoming campaign will focus on tax reform. The Conservative leader is skeptical of the role government can play in boosting private-sector growth. He sees his role as removing regulatory and policy roadblocks rather than intervening to provide support. Mr. Poilievre would be expected to lower personal income tax rates and eliminate many deductions, sources say. He also wants to simplify corporate taxes to encourage businesses to make investments. His agenda includes boosting energy and minerals production, along with rolling out a digital-economy strategy. Like his predecessors, Mr. Poilievre says he wants to spur more competition. Executives in any industry that looks oligopolistic – think of the Big Six banks or the Big Three telcos – are acutely aware they could be targeted as Mr. Poilievre looks to curb prices for consumers. Mr. Poilievre will put out a fully costed economic platform once the federal election campaign begins. Until then, he is leery of giving away ideas he fears the Liberals would adopt as their own. In the coming election, all the party’s platforms will likely take a back seat to the challenge of how their leaders plan to handle Mr. Trump, a self-styled master of the art of the deal. In recent weeks, the nation-defining challenge posed by the U.S. President led Mr. Poilievre to make a conscious pivot away from his theme that the country is broken. Instead, Mr. Poilievre is celebrating Canada as a land of unrealized opportunity. He used a keynote speech on National Flag Day in February to say the Conservatives “will unleash a fierce free enterprise economy.” Unleashing that economic potential, and dealing with Mr. Trump’s tariff threats, requires warming up what has been a frosty relationship between Mr. Poilievre and business leaders. No one expects a thaw just yet – not until after an election campaign.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Bradshaw, James; Willis, Andrew",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 8, 2025",Canada-US relations; Fund raising; Political leadership; Executives; Tariffs; Trade disputes; Taxes; Political campaigns; Prime ministers; Factories; Business government relations; Business community; Economic conditions,Nom: Conservative Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-03-08,The Globe and Mail
Fun with flags – Stephen Harper style:   Former prime minister’s new book recounts the century-long debate that produced the Maple Leaf,2025.0,"Flags of Canada BY STEPHEN J. HARPER (SUTHERLAND HOUSE, 82 PAGES) Stephen Harper inherited his fascination with vexillology, the study of flags, from his father, Joseph. In this, his third book, Canada’s 22nd prime minister puts his passion on paper. Over just 82 pages (plus illustrations), he describes the evolution of the flags of New France and of British North America, and recounts the century-long debate that eventually produced the Maple Leaf, which celebrated its 60th anniversary on Feb. 15. In telling these stories, Harper is also telling the story of Canada. For, as he observes, any debate over a flag is really a debate “about identity, history and the collective narratives in which one believed.” And yet, Flags of Canada is devoid of flag-waving, and is not a celebration of the Maple Leaf, one of the world’s most easily identifiable and attractive national emblems. Some might have hoped for something more rousing in these troubled days. Harper also avoids, for the most part, praising or condemning the various banners that have represented the country. Past narratives, he observes, “have portrayed the advocates of certain designs as heroes, while those preferring other designs come across as villains or deluded naysayers. These caricatures are a disservice to history.” Instead, he sticks to the facts as to why each flag once represented a particular place and time, only to give way to another, and then another. Although the author offers his own thoughts on the appropriateness of certain choices, any opinions are carefully considered: “A worthy opinion should have the facts as a minimum benchmark,” he writes. I leave it to the reader to decide whether that statement alludes to a certain politician south of the border. Harper observes that the banner grasped by the unicorn on Canada’s coat of arms is not, in fact, the flag of France in the years before the British conquest of New France. There was no national French flag at that time, France being more the realm of its absolutist monarch than a nation as we understand the term today. Its kings used different flags for different occasions, though one increasingly used in both France and New France was the Pavillon blanc, a white ensign, or naval flag, with or without additions of fleurs-de-lis or the royal shield. While there is much debate over what flags flew and when in New France, “what we do know is that the inhabitants of New France clearly identified white as their national colour,” Harper writes, just as red was seen as the national colour of the English. These identifications would greatly influence the debate over the national flag centuries later. Both before and after Confederation, British North America mostly used two flags: the Union Jack and variations of the Red Ensign. Prime minister John A. Macdonald advocated for the latter as the de facto national banner of the new dominion, and it flew above Parliament with his blessing. Canadian troops fought under the Red Ensign in two world wars, and the Government of Canada used the flag at international events and on buildings overseas. But there were, as there always are, divisions. One concerned what should be included in the flag’s shield. Another was whether the Red Ensign should be subordinate to the Union Jack, which many lovers of the British Empire preferred. And Quebec’s position continually shifted. When the Union Jack was favoured, French Canada preferred the Red Ensign. When the Red Ensign was favoured, Quebec rejected its British heritage. When debate heightened in the 1960s over what a new national flag should look like, Quebeckers shrugged, insisting only that it contain no British symbols. Lester Pearson campaigned to be Liberal prime minister on the promise of delivering a new flag for Canada, and after he won introduced such legislation in 1964. His proposed design consisted of three maple leaves on a white background with blue bars on either side (“from sea to sea”). Conservative leader John Diefenbaker passionately opposed the Pearson pennant, as it was quickly dubbed, and filibustered the legislation until, in frustration, the prime minister sent the matter to a Parliamentary committee. The final choice came down to the Pearson pennant and another candidate, a variation on the flag used at the Royal Military College. That proposal featured a single red maple leaf on a white background with red bars on each side. In the final secret ballot the Conservatives on the committee voted for the redand-white flag to prevent unanimous support for the Pearson pennant. Unbeknownst to them, the Liberals had decided to also vote for the maple leaf design. Diefenbaker, however, was still opposed to it, and the debate continued in the House until his own Quebec MPs rebelled against him. The old leader wept when the new flag was raised on Parliament Hill. (Those who want to read a more detailed account of the flag debate should seek out a copy of I Stand for Canada: The Story of the Maple Leaf Flag, by Rick Archbold, which was published in 2002.) Harper regrets that the Union Jack, and not the Red Ensign, was designated as the country’s secondary flag. As for the Maple Leaf itself, “my own perception, witnessing the flag of Canada flying at international institutions and world events, is that it holds up very well against the range of national flags. Its pattern is strong, unique, and rooted in history.” The book ends with Harper considering the possibility that future generations may seek to make changes to the banner. He thinks that unlikely. “It seems that the flag of Canada is as likely to endure as the country itself.” Long may it wave.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Ibbitson, John",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 8, 2025",Sailors; Books; Prime ministers; Flags,,2025-03-08,The Globe and Mail
'Knock it off': Poilievre sports tougher tone against Trump as trade war consumes attention,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre debuted his sternest words yet for U.S. President Donald Trump, as the question of who is best suited to handle his threats appears to be quickly becoming the defining issue of the next election. Poilievre walked through the line of 13 Canadian flags assembled to reach his podium on Friday at a moment when millions of Canadians are increasingly seeing red over Trump. Anger is brewing not only because of Trump's imposition of 25 per cent tariffs, which he decided on Thursday would be paused until next month, save for the levies on steel and aluminum that the president vowed are coming next week, but also Trump's attitude towards Canada, which can summed up by his repeated desire for it to become a state. Trump's hostility has led to a resurgence of national pride, with consumers declining to buy American goods and fans booing the U.S. anthem in sports arenas. Even the man behind the fictional ""Joe Canada"" character from a Molson Canadian beer commercial from two decades ago resurrected the beloved role to give Canadiansa rallying crying at a time they feel their sovereignty has been shaken. And against the backdrop of Trump another revival is stirring. This time, a political one. With Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his way out, after announcing his resignation in January, and two-time former central banker Mark Carney expected to win the Liberal leadership contest to replace him on Sunday, the Conservatives' year-and-a-half lead over the Liberals appears to keep narrowing, as Canadians are preoccupied with Trump. Poilievre acknowledged the cultural and political moment the country finds itself in on Friday when he began by offering some direct words to the president himself, before taking aim at Carney. ""My message to the president is this: Knock if off. Stop the chaos. You are hurting your workers, your consumers and most immediately destroying trillions of dollars of wealth on your own stock market."" ""You're attacking a cherished friend of the United States and you're strengthening America's enemies by going after America's friends."" Steady stream of smuggled guns from U.S. has claimed many Canadian lives Trudeau says he won't be a caretaker PM after Trump suggests he wants to 'stay in power' Trudeau gave a callout to Trump earlier in the week, addressing him as ""Donald,"" instead of ""president."" Putting it bluntly, Trudeau called his move to slap tariffs on Canadians ""dumb."" For Poilievre, Friday marked one of the first times he has so directly taken aim at Trump. Even before Canadians felt the reality of Trump's tariffs, Liberals and other critics of the Conservative leader having been drawing comparisons to his Republican counterpart. Carney plans to make that case to Canadians. He did so at a rally in Montreal Thursday night, telling the crowd that Poilievre was not the right leader for the current moment and accused him of worshipping at the president's feet. Carney also challenged Poilievre latest pitch to Canadians that he puts ""Canada First"" by contrasting that against his record of saying ""Canada is broken."" Poilievre has raised eyebrows in some circles further on the political right about his support for retaliatory tariffs in the first place. In a sit-down last month with Candace Malcolm, the right-wing media host questioned Poilievre's support of hitting back at the U.S. with countermeasures. ""A tariff that Canada imposes is really just a 25 per cent tax on the goods that we import,"" Malcolm said. ""It's a 25 per cent tax on what Canadians pay for, so why is a Conservative leader agreeing with basically a 25 per cent Liberal tax increase?"" After disagreeing that he supports anything like a ""Liberal tax increase,"" Poilievre argued that any tariff-related revenue must be put towards a tax cut. ""There's no question tariffs are taxes. That's why they're bad, but we have to defend our country and our industrial base if it comes under unfair and unprovoked attack by a foreign government and cut other taxes to neutralize the effect of that unfortunate, but necessary, action."" While the party sees some overlap between its supporters and those who favour Trump, Poilievre was quick to embrace the president's message last week when he told a British magazine he did not think too highly of the Canadian Conservative, saying Poilievre's biggest problem is that he isn't ""a MAGA guy."" Poilievre pointed to Trump's dislike of him when answering questions before reporters this week after Trump hit Canada with 25 per cent tariffs, saying ""it is true that I am Canada first."" ""I'm only for Canada, I'm fighting for the interest of this people and this country. And if that upsets foreign leaders, including the American president, I'm fine with that."" Such was the point Poilievre hammered home to a crowd in Ottawa when he staged his ""Canada First"" rally last month, where he showcased his promises to make Canada more competitive and bolster its border security at a time when its trust in the Americans to help defend its sovereignty and boost trade appears to be waning. It also an attempt to shift his message, which some Conservative insiders and membersfelt he was too slow to do. On that stage, standing in front of a gigantic Canadian flag with a word ""Canada"" blown up in large letters nearby as another patriotic touch, Poilievre laid out the options for, as he put it, Canada's ""American friends."" Either the U.S. keep attacking its closest ally with tariffs that will trigger retaliation, or both nations work together to increase trade and business even more. Almost three weeks to the day when Poilievre delivered that speech, which is largely expected to be the theme of the Conservative campaign in an election that could be triggered before the end of the month, he repeated those options once again. This time, however, he dropped ""friends"" for Trump's name instead. ""Stop tariffing our country and stop the monthly melodrama that is hurting our economies on both sides of the border,"" Poilievre said. With Trump threatening even more tariffs, now taking aim at Canada's dairy industry on Friday, Poilievre is likely to stick with his tougher tone.

How an Ottawa nurse turned an Ontario PC stronghold Liberal,2025.0,"It was a moment he had spent years preparing for, but just months before Ontario's snap election call, Tyler Watt was having second thoughts. The 34-year-old registered nurse and community advocate had been helping his family care for his terminally ill father while working full-time at the Queensway Carleton Hospital. ""That became my whole life, on top of running for the nomination."" As anticipation grew about an early election call, Watt began to wonder whether it was the right time to make a second attempt to seek election in the long-time Progressive Conservative riding of Nepean. It was his father who convinced him. ""You have to do this,"" he told Watt. He encouraged Watt to use his own experience to help others trying to navigate the health system, including home care. ""He knew how much I cared about this and how much I care about this community."" Watt's father died in December. Less than two months later, Watt won a sweeping victory, almost 5,000 votes ahead of Progressive Conservative candidate Alex Lewis, flipping the riding after decades of PC leadership. Premier Doug Ford, who won a majority, had framed the campaign around the threat of tariffs, but Watt said health care is what most people wanted to talk about. ""Hands down, health care was the No. 1 issue. Everyone has a health care story and experience."" As he prepared to head to Queen's Park for an orientation, the win was beginning to sink in. ""I am still over the moon. This is definitely one of the most incredible experiences of my life. It is starting to feel real now,"" said Watt. Tyler Watt, Nepean's newly-elected Liberal MPP, holds one of the three seats the PCs lost in the province. Watt, who grew up in Barrhaven, followed his mother's footsteps into nursing. He didn't plan on running for office. But even as a student nurse at St. Lawrence College he felt compelled to speak out about issues that affected him and others, starting with cuts to the Ontario Student Assistance Program. His growing social media presence and activism got noticed. Early on, he was contacted by someone from the Ontario Liberal Party who said: ""What you are doing is resonating with people."" After that contact, Watt spent one summer working as a legislative assistant to Liberal MPP Mitzi Hunter which gave him a new perspective. ""That is where I think I got the idea that maybe this is for me."" Watt began working full-time as a nurse at the very beginning of the pandemic. He continued to build a social media following, bringing a ""nurse's lens"" to the health emergency and advocating for better policies: ""Just me, speaking my mind."" Among other things, Watt helped ""sound the alarm"" over growing levels of burnout and frustration among nurses and other health workers. Still, Watt said he had to ""walk a fine line"" as a health worker to avoid speaking about his own work. ""I have never spoken about my job or my patients and always kept it very general."" His growing public presence helped earn him the nomination as the Liberal candidate in the 2022 provincial election, running against veteran incumbent Lisa MacLeod, who was first elected in 2006. He lost that race to MacLeod by just about 2,000 votes, increasing the Liberal share of the vote in the riding by more than 14 per cent. The closeness of that vote solidified Watt's resolve to run again. Before this year's election call, MacLeod announced she would not run again. Watt credits his nursing training and work experience to help him connect with people, including while knocking on doors, some days up to 300 of them. ""For me, as a nurse, that in-person interaction is everything. There were some doors where I was there for 10 or 20 minutes and there were a lot of meaningful, touching experiences. I've cried with people at the door. People have given me a hug afterward. These are all stories I will remember for the rest of my life."" And while Watt's win helped the provincial Liberals regain official party status, the NDP remainsthe official opposition in Ontario and the PCs hold a firm majority. Still, Watt believes he can make a difference by bringing his constituents' concerns and his own experience as an RN to Queen's Park.

Poilievre pledges to close 'Carney loophole' on disclosures for leadership candidates,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is promising to change the Conflict of Interest Act to force party leadership candidates to disclose financial holdings within a month of declaring their candidacy. The pledge comes after the opposition parties have accused Liberal leadership frontrunner Mark Carney of exploiting a loophole in the Act that could allow him to become prime minister and run in an election without having disclosed his financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest. ""You have to ask yourself, for whose benefit is the prime minister of Canada actually working?"" said Poilievre this morning at a press conference in Toronto. ""Mr. Carney could win the Liberal leadership and become prime minister without revealing to Canadians his massive, multi-million dollar foreign holdings."" Under the change proposed by Poilievre, candidates would have to disclose any financial holdings to the ethics commissioner within 30 days and make them publicly available in 60 days. The Conservatives also promised to force future prime ministers and ministers to sell assets that create conflicts of interest. Currently, elected officials have 60 days to share this information with the ethics commissioner and another 60 days before it becomes public. Carney would ""not merely comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines, but surpass them,"" said Liam Roche, a spokesperson for Carney, in an emailed statement to National Post. ""The office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has already been contacted ahead of time to help ensure all appropriate steps can be initiated right away, and assets would be immediately placed in a blind trust,"" wrote Roche. But Poilievre warned at Friday's press conference that under the current rules, Carney could place his investments in a blind trust while maintaining all the same holdings, giving him full knowledge of his own investments and raising the possibility of conflicts. The Conservative leader also called on Carney to voluntary disclose his financial holdings immediately. ""Within four days we will have a new prime minister who will be negotiating with president Trump and that incoming prime minister refuses to tell Canadians where his millions of dollars are invested and, therefore, where his real interests lie,"" said Poilievre. Canada's ethics laws have come under scrutiny from all sides of the political spectrum recently. The parliamentary ethics committee's inquiry into Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault's affairs last year revealed other issues. The inquiry followed reporting by Global News on payments to Boissonnault from a federal lobbying business and his connection to a PPE company in Edmonton, which had faced several lawsuits from its suppliers.

David Staples: Poilievre and Smith wary about Ottawa grabbing and wasting tariff dollars,2025.0,"Canada's political leaders are standing as one against the threat of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which were once again partly delayed by Trump, this time until April 2. There's broad bipartisan agreement - from Liberals Justin Trudeau and Mark Carney to Conservative Pierre Poilievre, from the UCP's Danielle Smith to the NDP's Naheed Nenshi -- on most big issues. That incudes the necessity of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and the benefits of axing more interprovincial trade barriers. But on one key issue - the negotiation tactics around a possible export tax on Alberta oil and on what to do with potential tariff revenues - there's major disagreement. Poilievre and Smith are wary of the federal government's well-known capacity to grab and waste money. While Trudeau and Nenshi focus on the need to provide government payments to support workers and industries hard hit by tariffs, Poilievre's primary plan would be to help all Canadians with a tax cut. ""Counter tariffs must not be a cash cow for the government,"" he said this week. ""Almost every penny of these collected should go to tax cuts with a small sum set aside for targeted relief to workers hardest hit by the trade war. None of the money should go to new government spending and programs. We must not allow politicians to dishonestly use this crisis to once again launch a debt-fuelled, money-printing spending spree."" As for Carney, his policy on this matter sounds much like what Poilievre would do, taking tariff proceeds and having them go directly to workers most affected by tariffs but also promising a middle-class tax cut. The major area of disagreement is around what might happen if Trump carves out Canadian energy from his general tariff plan. Trump already did so in his initial threat, calling for a 10 per cent tariff on energy and a 25 per cent tariff on all other Canadian goods. In federal Liberal circles there's been much musing about Ottawa rejecting any carve-out on energy, essentially replacing any U.S. tariff reduction with a Canadian export tax on our oil and gas, with Ottawa driving up U.S. costs while collecting billions. But Trudeau has now joined with Smith in rejecting such an export tax. Asked how Canada should respond if Trump carved out oil and gas, Trudeau again on Thursday gave an Alberta-friendly response. ""Any carve-outs that support any workers in Canada, even if it's just one industry or another, are going to be a good thing."" He added: ""The unity that Canadians are feeling right now is actually the most important thing in being able to stand up against a trading partner that is much bigger than us but is facing real internal debates and divisions on the impacts of these unjustified tariffs."" If some Canadian industries get a carve out it will mean they will still be strong and not need federal financial assistance, Trudeau said, thus enabling funds to be dir,ected at workers and industries hardest hit. For months, Smith has forcefully rejected such an export tax on oil and gas. Could it be she got through to Trudeau? Or maybe Trudeau has at last decided to govern for all of us. Or maybe he simply doesn't need to hammer Alberta any longer to win votes in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. For their part, Carney and Nenshi are less clear about an export tax on Alberta oil and gas. They refused to rule out the scheme this week. ""When you have cards in negotiations you don't offer them up. We should never take things off the table but we should work collaboratively,"" Carney said. Carney still considering putting an export tax on Alberta oil. The tax would enrich Ottawa and hammer Alberta, something Trudeau has now said must not happen to any region if we're to be united. Hard for Carney to part with his global elitist distaste for oil and gas? - David Staples (@DavidStaplesYEG) March 5, 2025 Should we buy Carney's position? Why would we? Aren't a number of options, in fact, easy for federal politicians to rule out? For example, would not Carney rule out doing anything that might harm the Quebec dairy cartel? Surely anything that might harm Ontario's auto sector is also sacrosanct? Why not do the same for Alberta's oil and gas? Nenshi essentially agreed with Carney on this matter, saying we have to use our ""best tools"" against the U.S. ""That means taking nothing off the table. That means showing our teeth when we need to show our teeth."" Nenshi makes a reasonable point about the art of negotiation but, on the matter of an oil and gas export tax, Alberta would be negotiating against Ottawa, not Trump. We would have to fight to get all revenue from such a tax to bail out Alberta, as opposed to flowing it to Ottawa. Should such a day ever come, I'll suggest the hardline position adopted by Smith is the best tool to get Alberta a win. dstaples@postmedia.com Related 'Lose-lose situation': Alberta municipal affairs minister concerned about long-term impacts of tariffs Alberta to stop buying U.S. booze, encourage buying Canadian as part of four-pronged response to tariffs Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the news you need to know - add EdmontonJournal.com and EdmontonSun.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters You can also support our journalism by becoming a digital subscriber.

"The future for nuclear energy is bright, but only if we learn lessons of the past; Private sector must play a role in next generation, Erin O'Toole writes",2025.0,"As Canada prepares to meet its growing energy needs, there is no longer debate about the central role nuclear will play. Critics have become converts in what is being called the ""nuclear renaissance,"" but before we break ground on the next generation of reactors, Canadian policy-makers must answer one crucial question: Who bears the risk for cost overruns, and how do we prevent them in the first place? If we fail to get this right, we will struggle to expand nuclear power precisely when we need it most. The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) has projected that electricity demand in Ontario alone will rise by 75 per cent in the coming decades. This estimate only projects meeting demand forecast today, but as AI, data centres and quantum computing evolve alongside electrification, the real demand will likely be higher. To meet this challenge, we must plan to nearly double our emissions-free generation capacity. Ontario has indicated that it plans to add more large-scale nuclear generation capacity alongside the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The future for nuclear is bright, but only if we learn from lessons of the past. Canada was third country to achieve nuclear fission, but our history is also littered with cautionary tales of construction delays and cost overruns. I grew up in Bowmanville during the construction of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station. Its economic benefits were undeniable, then and now, but so were the crippling budget overruns. What was planned as a $4.5-billion project ballooned to over $14 billion by completion. The resulting stranded costs contributed to the breakup of Ontario Hydro, the restructuring of the electricity sector, and a debt-servicing charge on the electricity bill of Ontarians that they paid for 16 years. Other provinces did not fare much better. Generating stations in Quebec and New Brunswick faced construction delays and cost overruns, leading Quebec to eventually abandon nuclear. In New Brunswick, the costs associated with refurbishing their plant led to rate pressures and even a Hail Mary pass in 2009 to sell New Brunswick Power to Hydro-Québec. The deal was abandoned due to public opposition to the sale, but it demonstrates the enormous challenges provinces face. The U.S.had a similar history with respect to costs and delays, which is why in 2024, the Biden administration launched a working group to tackle nuclear cost overruns and construction delays. This is now a bipartisan effort in the U.S. to bring together project developers, engineers, utilities, investors and labour leaders to identify ways to discuss project delivery and reduce overrun risk. Canada has had great success with its CANDU fleet of reactors and a better overall track record than the Americans. Ontario was able to eliminate the burning of coal because of nuclear energy, and this still ranks as the largest greenhouse gas emission reduction achievement in Canadian history. That said, we must come up with a smarter approach to building and operating these plants. Canada needs to ask the same questions that are being explored in the United States. Governments will always have a critical role to play in planning for the electricity needs for their province and regulating the safety of operations, but better contracting models are needed. The restructuring of Ontario Hydro back in the 1990s shows us what is possible. Ontario Power Generation nuclear assets in Tiverton were transferred to a private consortium known as Bruce Power. Its ownership includes two operator unions, a Canadian pension fund and a Canadian energy company. This private sector operator has safely operated and refurbished reactors at the site, and works closely with other utilities to ensure that operators across the fleet of reactors in Ontario can learn from one another. Their model and other international projects show that a high level of training, accountability measures and milestone-based financing can deliver safe and effective performance without runaway costs. Before we start writing the next chapter of nuclear energy in Canada, lets be sure we take away all the lessons from the first chapter. The private sector must play a role in both the construction and operation of the next generation of nuclear stations in Ontario and be part of the risk sharing solution.

Business Brief: Poilievre’s relationship with corporate Canada:   Pierre Poilievre is running against big business in his bid to be the Prime Minister,2025.0,"Good morning. For the past several months, my colleague James Bradshaw, who covers institutional investors, and I have been researching how Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre – whose relationships with CEOs range from prickly to non-existent – would work with business leaders if elected Prime Minister in the coming federal election. More on that below, but first: In the news Trade: Trump waives 25-per-cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada until April 2 Auto: Tariffs will hurt the Detroit Three automakers and drive up vehicle prices for their customers, says Martinrea International Inc. executive Bonus: RBC paid chief executive officer Dave McKay nearly $26-million last year, a 60-per-cent raise from his prior-year compensation.

Pierre Poilievre’s disdain for big business is creating an uneasy relationship with corporate Canada:   Mark Carney’s closer Bay Street ties could spell trouble for the Conservative leader,2025.0,"On the 34th floor of First Canadian Place, the BMO-branded tower at the core of corporate Canada’s Bay Street hub, a distinctly downtown crowd of about 150 people gathered to get a glimpse of Pierre Poilievre. Law firm Bennett Jones hosted the fundraiser. Robert Staley – a close ally of the Conservative leader and chair of the party’s powerful fundraising arm – is the firm’s vice-chair and a partner. Other hosts included Scotiabank vice-chair Mark Mulroney, son of a former prime minister, health care services executive Shaun Francis of Medcan Health Management and former Assante Wealth Management CEO Joe Canavan. The price of admission was $1,750 per head to hear ""Pierre share his common sense vision for Canada,"" as the party had advertised it. For Mr. Poilievre, gatherings like this over his first two years as party leader were unremarkable events ahead of what was expected to be a cake walk of an election against Justin Trudeau. The stakes rose when the Prime Minister decided to resign, U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war and Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney emerged as a viable answer to the question: Who is best equipped to deal with Mr. Trump? Many of the executives shaking Mr. Poilievre’s hands on this evening were back-slapping with Mr. Carney, and handing him cheques, at a fundraiser the previous week. The cake walk has become a horse race. And losing a contest he seemed all but certain to win would likely see Mr. Poilievre put out to pasture, just like his past two predecessors. As guests sipped Oyster Bay Chardonnay, Mr. Poilievre delivered a familiar stump speech, according to four sources who attended the event in late February. He promised to lower taxes, make Canada more competitive, and get things done faster. He took shots at Mr. Carney for being ""just like Justin"" – and for moving Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.‘s head office to New York when he was its board chair. And he made a few remarks about the looming threats from the United States on tariffs. When one executive in the crowd - William Cheng, owner of a Mississauga company that makes candles - said he would consider moving his factory and its 500 employees to avoid tariffs, Mr. Poilievre urged him not to give up on Canada just yet, and said he would create a more welcoming environment for entrepreneurs, sources who witnessed the exchange said. On the event’s sidelines, Mr. Poilievre chatted with top business executives, including Edward Rogers, the executive chair of Rogers Communications Inc. and scion of the family that controls the telecommunications giant. But sources in attendance said his remarks to the larger group lacked specific details about the Conservatives’ plan for business and the economy, or for winning a trade war with Mr. Trump. The evening was hardly a love-in, and had more of an atmosphere of an obligatory gathering of extended family, sources who were in the room said. But neither did Mr. Poilievre antagonize the business leaders, as he has in the past. At another time, with another Conservative candidate, none of this would be especially noteworthy. But Mr. Poilievre has as unconventional, fraught, at times even hostile relationship with the business leaders who make up Canada’s corporate power centre. He openly challenges the clubby relationship that existed between CEOs and previous Conservative leaders. He has shown a distinct lack of interest in, and respect for, the finance crowd. In December, 2023, Mr. Poilievre started a lunch speech to bankers and fund managers at downtown Toronto’s C.D. Howe Institute by saying, ""I almost never speak to crowds in downtown Toronto or anywhere close to Bay Street."" With Mr. Poilievre still considered the frontrunner to be Canada’s prime minister after the next federal election campaign, business leaders are struggling to understand what to expect if he wins – and the extent to which some of them could end up in his crosshairs one day. The Globe and Mail interviewed nearly 30 senior people in business and political roles about what Prime Minister Poilievre would mean for Canadian business. The Globe is not identifying most of those sources as they feared professional repercussions for speaking out about him. A spokesperson for Mr. Poilievre did not respond to a request for comment. Some of Mr. Poilievre’s policy positions are familiar hallmarks of Conservative orthodoxy. He leans toward free markets, blaming obstacles such as high taxes and overregulation for getting in the way of entrepreneurs and investors whose risk-taking creates jobs and raises wages for workers. In general, business leaders welcome those instincts. In other respects, he is a breed of Conservative leader that the country’s business elite has rarely encountered. Mr. Poilievre has almost no connections to the business world. He has spent his entire career in politics, serving as an MP since 2004, when he was 25 years old. His lone brush with work in the corporate world was a job working the phones to do corporate collections for Telus as a teenager. As a parliamentarian, Mr. Poilievre earned a reputation as an attack dog, and the instincts he honed are still on display. He spent time as the Conservative finance critic, where business sources say he gained a good grasp of the financial sector, but always through a political lens. Mr. Poilievre thinks the leaders of big companies don’t understand how government works, and is skeptical of what he sees as an ineffective, self-interested corporate culture that is out of touch with the needs of workers, sources said. Top business executives think Mr. Poilievre doesn’t understand big business, and won’t surround himself with many people who do, senior business sources said. Corporate leaders repeatedly said they are concerned he is too caught up in the cut-and-thrust of Question Period and catchy slogans like ""Axe the Tax."" In public and in private, Mr. Poilievre is sharply critical of top executives and CEOs, ""particularly a certain type of business leader, I might add – a more Bay Street, corporate, Toronto-centric type of business leader,"" said Ginny Roth, a partner at Crestview Strategy who served as Mr. Poilievre’s communications director when he ran for the Conservative leadership. In an opinion piece in the National Post last May, Mr. Poilievre chastised ""gutless executives"" and their circuit of ""pointless luncheons and meetings,"" saying there was no guarantee that ""businesses will get their way"" from a Poilievre government. People close to Mr. Poilievre still point to the article as a window into his thinking, and a road map for how to interact with him. ""If you do have a policy proposal, don’t tell me about it. Convince Canadians that it’s good for them. Communicate your policy’s benefits directly to workers, consumers and retirees,"" he wrote. He loudly blames big corporations and their leaders for staying silent when Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal government made missteps, and even cozying up to the government to win its support and subsidies. Mr. Poilievre and his team are particularly critical of businesses for what they see as self-serving lobbying in pursuit of corporate handouts. As one friend in Conservative politics put it: ""Pierre’s superpower is not caring what Bay Street thinks of him."" ""When Poilievre thinks about solutions – like lowering taxes, and deregulation and all kinds of policy-making questions – he’s not terribly interested in spending all his time talking to those people,"" Ms. Roth said. Former prime minister Stephen Harper was not especially close to major business leaders, and his finance minister Jim Flaherty occasionally took them to task in public. But Mr. Poilievre’s critiques have a harder edge. CEOs who have raised money for him say the elbows-up style is something business leaders need to get used to. ""Does Pierre understand the challenges facing business, like a lack of investment, weak productivity and too much red tape? He 100 per cent does,"" said Dan Daviau, chairman and CEO of investment bank Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. ""Will 100 per cent of business leaders be comfortable with how he plans to tackle these challenges? Hard to say, as Pierre represents fundamental change and change sometimes is hard on the status quo."" Contrast that with Mr. Carney, the would-be Liberal leader, who arrives on the scene with long-established ties in the top ranks of business, and is casting himself as a political outsider. Many of the executives shaking Mr. Poilievre’s hand are also back-slapping at Liberal events and donating to the former central banker. Across a string of fund raisers from both parties, executives have been taking the measure of both politicians. The event at First Canadian Place was one of three that Mr. Poilievre attended in Toronto that week, with another at the Lambton Golf &amp; Country Club, and a third at Mr. Daviau’s Yorkville home. On March 11, executives from toy maker Spin Master Corp. plan to host another soiree in mid-town Toronto. Executives meeting Mr. Poilievre for the first time have said he’s hard to like, and even harder to read. Several bankers and lawyers say they have met the Conservative leader on multiple occasions, but still have no clear sense of what makes him tick. His populist messaging, which has focused on the country being ""broken,"" inevitably draws comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump. But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Poilievre shows almost no desire to surround himself with billionaires or top CEOs. And last week, Mr. Trump put some distance between the two men, saying that Mr. Poilievre’s ""biggest problem is he’s not a MAGA guy."" Some sources who have seen Mr. Poilievre up close are more complimentary. They said he is the same in private as he is in public and his message is consistent, which makes him predictable. He consumes huge amounts of information, including reports from bank economists, and sometimes calls the authors to discuss them further. He is said to be intellectually curious, has a good command of facts, and does his homework, the sources said. He has no problem with CEOs offering ideas and advice, they said. But he is deeply frustrated with chief executives who are, in his eyes, too risk-averse and meek, tiptoeing around and trying to avoid causing offense. He is irked when corporate leaders take selfies with Mr. Trudeau, even as they trash the Liberal prime minister in private, one source said. ""If business leaders do have creative ideas that don’t involve either protection or spending, they should propose them. They should talk about them in public. They should convince people they’re a good idea,"" Ms. Roth said. ""And there’s no reason to believe he won’t listen."" Mr. Poilievre wants more blunt talk. He relishes it, enjoys it, and thinks that’s part of a healthy relationship, rather than damaging to relations, sources said. Charm, executives say, is not his style. That makes many among Canada’s business elite wary. They point to Mr. Poilievre’s response to a controversy when CTV News journalists edited a clip of him in a way that was misleading to viewers. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr. Poilievre took direct aim at Mirko Bibic, chief executive of Bell Canada, the network’s owner, calling him ""an overpaid CEO"" who ""empties the books to pay his wealthy friends an unacceptably and unrealistically high dividend."" ""He and his cronies at that company are going after me because they know that I am standing up for the people against the crony capitalists and insiders like them,"" Mr. Poilievre said. Senior executives said they found the comments gratuitous and unnecessarily personal. They fear that Mr. Poilievre would turn on any CEO if it’s politically advantageous. In banking circles, Mr. Poilievre’s eleventh hour decision to oppose Royal Bank of Canada’s $13.5-billion takeover of HSBC Bank Canada was seen as an attempt to score political points. Executives from multiple banks said the Conservative leader only decided to say he would block the purchase 11 months after the deal was announced, so he could portray Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland as a friend of RBC when she approved the deal – which she did several weeks later. Bankers say Mr. Poilievre ignored the reality of the transaction, with London-based HSBC determined to leave the Canadian market. ""If the wariness comes from a place of, he is going to be different, and he is not concerned with violating norms – particularly the norms of a cozy business-government relationship – then that wariness is warranted,"" Ms. Roth said. ""But I don’t think that is cause for panic, or even really concern. I think the positive side for business is the guy is pretty easy to read."" It would be wrong to assume that Mr. Poilievre has no contact with business leaders. He meets with CEOs selectively. But most of the leading figures in Canadian business have never had a one-on-one conversation with a Conservative who has been in politics for more than two decades, sources said. A small circle of prominent business people have at least some access to the Conservative leader. Scotiabank’s Mr. Mulroney has helped build his profile by making introductions and raised money for his campaigns, as did Mr. Daviau. Billionaire Mattamy Homes founder Peter Gilgan, an entrepreneur with strong views on the housing shortage, hosted a fundraiser for Mr. Poilievre in his penthouse condominium. Tech-focused fund manager John Ruffolo, founder of Maverix Private Equity, and former Blackberry co-CEO Jim Balsillie are helping Mr. Poilievre come up with a strategy to encourage business investment and build the country’s digital economy. Shopify Inc. founder Tobi Lütke is swapping ideas on strengthening the tech sector with Mr. Poilievre, but one source said Mr. Lütke is keeping a low profile to avoid being cast as an Elon Musk-wannabe. A spokesperson for Shopify did not respond to a request for comment. The government relations machine has revved up in recent months, with companies flocking to other ex-Conservative ministers such as Lisa Raitt, James Moore and Rona Ambrose for advice on how to approach Mr. Poilievre. But sources cautioned that none of these people are especially close to Mr. Poilievre, after he remade the core of the Conservative party. The inner circle that surrounds Mr. Poilievre is small and closely guarded: It includes his top adviser, Jenni Byrne – a former chief of staff to Mr. Harper – as well as Mr. Staley from Bennett Jones and lawyer Michael Wilson of Goodmans LLP, a former chief of staff to Ontario’s attorney general. Sources said Mr. Poilievre also speaks regularly to Mr. Harper. Conservative MPs who play a key role on Mr. Poilievre’s team include Adam Chambers, a former executive at Canada Life Assurance Co. with a joint MBA-law degree, and Melissa Lantsman, who worked in communications at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Coca-Cola Canada Bottling Ltd. Both could be in line for key roles in a Conservative cabinet. Former Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is seen as a leading candidate to be Mr. Poilievre’s finance minister, sources said. Mr. Poilievre’s cabinet is unlikely to have much representation from people with deep business experience, as past finance ministers such as Liberal Bill Morneau and Conservatives Joe Oliver and Michael Wilson had – and that is by design. Most Canadians will be familiar with the broad strokes of Mr. Poilievre’s pitch to voters, encapsulated in pithy slogans: He will scrap the carbon tax, ""fix"" the federal budget, spur more home building and crack down on crime. The business elements of his platform in the upcoming campaign will focus on tax reform. The Conservative leader is skeptical of the role government can play in boosting private-sector growth. He sees his role as removing regulatory and policy roadblocks rather than intervening to provide support. Mr. Poilievre would be expected to lower personal income tax rates and eliminate many deductions, sources say. He also wants to simplify corporate taxes to encourage businesses to make investments. His agenda includes boosting energy and minerals production, along with rolling out a digital-economy strategy. Like his predecessors, Mr. Poilievre says he wants to spur more competition. Executives in any industry that looks oligopolistic – think of the Big Six banks or the Big Three telcos – are acutely aware they could be targeted as Mr. Poilievre looks to curb prices for consumers. Mr. Poilievre will put out a fully costed economic platform once the federal election campaign begins, sources say. Until then, he is leery of giving away ideas he fears the Liberals would adopt as their own. In the coming election, all the party’s platforms will likely take a back seat to the challenge of how their leaders plan to handle Mr. Trump, a self-styled master of the art of the deal. In recent weeks, the nation-defining challenge posed by the U.S. President led Mr. Poilievre to make a conscious pivot away from his theme that the country is broken. Instead, Mr. Poilievre is celebrating Canada as a land of unrealized opportunity. He used a keynote speech on National Flag Day in February to say the Conservatives ""will unleash a fierce free enterprise economy."" Unleashing that economic potential, and dealing with Mr. Trump’s tariff threats, requires warming up what has been a frosty relationship between Mr. Poilievre and business leaders. No one expects a thaw just yet – not until after an election campaign.

"Poilievre, citing Carney, to promise to change conflict law:   The Conservative leader would also change the law to force future prime ministers and their cabinets to sell off any assets that could create a conflict of interest",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will change conflict-of-interest law so it applies to leadership candidates if his party forms government in the next election, The Globe and Mail has learned. He’s framing the move as closing the ""Carney loophole,"" a reference to the criticism of Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney’s decision not to disclose his financial holdings and potential conflicts until he’s required to under the law. Mr. Poilievre would also change the law to force future prime ministers and their cabinets to sell off any assets that could create a conflict of interest. Mr. Poilievre is set to make the promises at an event in Toronto on Friday morning. The Globe obtained an advance copy of the press release. The existing Conflict of Interest Act applies to public office holders, which includes the prime minister and cabinet ministers, as well as ministerial staffers and government appointees, among others. MPs are covered by a conflict-of-interest code. Neither the act nor the code apply at present for Mr. Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada, who does not hold a seat in the House of Commons. It also does not apply for leadership candidate Frank Baylis, who is also not an MP. Two other leadership candidates, Chrystia Freeland and Karina Gould, are MPs, so are already covered by the code. Whoever wins Sunday’s Liberal leadership vote will become prime minister, and then the act will apply. Currently, it requires a disclosure of financial holdings to the federal ethics commissioner within 60 days and a public declaration of those assets within 120 days. Certain assets must also be sold or placed in a blind trust – meaning a third-party will control and make decisions about them; the act prohibits public office holders from holding assets that could be affected by government policy, such as stocks or bonds. Mr. Carney’s campaign said Thursday that he’ll place his assets in a blind trust. The Conservatives have been highly critical of Mr. Carney’s approach, saying his refusal to proactively disclose means it could be months before Canadians have a full picture of any conflicts of interest that he might have. Mr. Poilievre’s changes would require leadership candidates to disclose their holdings to the Ethics Commissioner within 30 days of becoming an official candidate and make them publicly available within 60 days. Mr. Poilievre would also remove the option of using a blind trust. Mr. Carney’s corporate connections have come under scrutiny throughout the leadership race. In addition to being the former BoC governor and Bank of England governor, he has sat on numerous high-profile boards. But he has declined to fully disclose his financial situation, saying for now he is a private citizen and has no legal obligation to do so. On the day he launched his leadership bid, Mr. Carney also announced that he was stepping back from all his corporate board positions, including chair of Brookfield Asset Management, a major investment company. While he was chair of the board, the company technically relocated its headquarters to New York City for better access to U.S. stock indices. When asked about the move, Mr. Carney initially claimed that it was made after he left the board, but corporate records proved it had happened while he was still in charge. In the news release for Friday’s event, Mr. Poilievre references the Brookfield issue. ""How could Carney negotiate with Trump if he sneakily still has shares in a U.S.-headquartered company?"" Mr. Poilievre says. He adds: ""Canadians deserve to know whether their Prime Minister is working against their best interests for their own profit.""

How did the Conservative Party come to this?,2025.0,"He joked about setting polar bears loose on the streets of Winnipeg as a way to reduce homelessness. He doesn’t support pandemic shutdowns, or mask mandates and falsely claims that wearing a medical mask to protect yourself and others carries “health risks.” He describes himself as “pro-life” and claims that public schools are purveyors of pornography and that parents should assert their rights and take back their children’s education. He wants to “unlock” the natural resources of the north and says that one of the reasons he’s running is to “fight wokeism.” One assumes that by wokeism, he’s referring to anyone who fights for environmental justice, defends the rights of women and all people, regardless of gender choice, race or religious belief His name is Wally Daudrich, and he’s one of the candidates running for the leadership of Manitoba’s Progressive Conservative Party. Mr. Daudrich, by the way, doesn’t have a medical degree, can site no evidence of pornographic material in Manitoba schools and has made his money bussing tourists around Churchill to whale watch and hang out with threatened polar bears, from the safety of a giant dune buggy. His sole competitor in the leadership race is Obby Khan, an ex-football player and onetime owner of a juicing operation called Green Carrot, who got into a row with a newspaper owner for pointing out that he had been sued by a former business partner. Khan’s platform, such as it is, is based mainly on platitudes about economic growth, eliminating “red tape” for business, building networks — ie roads, as if we didn’t have enough of those to maintain — and fostering corporate interests. Not a peep about health care, dealing with a price-gouging economy that’s strangling so many families, the homeless crisis or any of the other socio-economic problems we face on a daily basis. Bottom line? — there’s not much for the average Manitoban in the Daudrich-Khan take on leadership, unless you happen to believe our educational system is corrupting our kids, that freedom means never wearing a medical mask or that trickledown economics is alive and well and living in Manitoba. That said there’s lots to celebrate for frackers, the resource and construction industries and the top 20 per cent who already own a whopping 68 per cent of Canada’s wealth. So how did the Conservatives — the party of Sir John A. Macdonald, Joe Clark, and even my least favorite of the somewhat saner Tories, Brian Mulroney — come to this? How did this long-lived political party wind up being led by people like Alberta’s Danielle Smith, federal Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre and wannabes like Daudrich and Khan? Well, bear with me while I explain how Canada’s conservative party morphed into a mini-me version of the American Republican Party. It all started in 1987, when a disgruntled, bible-thumping, hard right social conservative from Alberta, named Preston Manning, laid siege to what was then the Progressive Conservative Party (PCs). Nursing a long held grudge against an Eastern Canadian establishment exploiting a resource rich West, Manning founded the Reform Party and set out to challenge the PCs with a new approach to conservatism. An approach that was not just fiscally conservative but socially conservative to boot. Manning won that challenge, eventually forcing a merger between Reform and the PCs. As a result, the federal Conservative Party deleted the word progressive from its lexicon and replaced it with social conservativism and an idea of individual freedom seemingly devoid of any sense of social responsibility. And the rest, as they say, is history. So, no surprise that conservative leader, Pierre Poilivre — the political progeny of Manning and Stephen Harper — supported a trucker convoy that paralyzed the streets of Ottawa and harassed its citizens for a month. All because the truckers believed that Covid shutdowns and medical mask mandates somehow threatened what they believed to be their “individual” rights and freedoms. In fact Poilievre and his party — just like the American Republicans — have consistently spouted false narratives depicting any progressive or socially responsible action, whether pertaining to women, diversity, protecting the environment or reducing carbon emissions as plots to restrict our freedom. And the sad thing is some Canadians are buying in to that bogus narrative. This, despite the fact that the Conservative Party is far more interested in protecting the rights of corporations and their freedom to make huge profits, than in our rights to an adequate wage, a roof over our heads and a social safety net that protects us all. So am I surprised the only candidates to run for leadership of the Manitoba Conservatives are Wally Daudrich and Obby Khan? Not in the least. Because both, in their own ways, are truly representative of what the Conservative Party has become. Erna Buffie is a writer and environmental activist.

"Canadians don't like Trump, poll confirms:   Pollster says views could be bad news for Poilievre",2025.0,"Canadians overwhelmingly support retaliatory measures against Donald Trump's tariffs and most think ""negatively"" about the U.S. president, a new poll suggests. The Pollara Strategic Insights survey, conducted before Trump's levies took effect Tuesday, found only 14 per cent feel positively about him while 76 per cent have negative feelings, with the rest undecided. Dan Arnold, chief strategy officer at Pollara, said the survey contained warning signs for federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in his looming faceoff with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal successor. Fully 41 per cent of respondents believe Poilievre would ""do what Trump demands"" while 27 per cent felt the Tory chief would ""strongly oppose his demands."" In contrast, just 17 per cent thought Liberal front-runner Mark Carney would do what Trump wanted, while 44 per cent said the former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor would oppose the president's demands. Similarly, 16 per cent said Liberal hopeful Chrystia Freeland would do what Trump demanded, while 44 per cent said the former deputy prime minister would oppose his demands. The Liberals will elect their new leader Sunday. By comparison, 27 per cent said Trudeau would accede to Trump's demands, with 46 per cent saying he would oppose him. About 21 per cent felt NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh would do what Trump wanted, with 42 per cent saying he would oppose the American president. ""If you want one data point to show why the Liberals have caught up to the Conservatives - or close to it - in the polls, this is it,"" said Arnold of the apparent advantage enjoyed by Carney and Freeland over Poilievre when it comes to Trump. ""People are obsessed with Donald Trump right now. That is the only thing you're thinking about. That's where the ballot question is - and Canadians aren't convinced at this point that Poilievre will oppose Trump, will stand up to his demands,"" he said. A staggering 90 per cent believed governments should ""encourage people to buy Canadian,"" with only six per cent opposed to that and four per cent unsure. More than six in seven Canadians - 85 per cent - said Canada ""should sign free trade deals with other countries,"" while six per cent opposed that and eight per cent were unsure. That's virtually identical to the 85 per cent who supported the premiers' current push to ""remove trade barriers that exist between Canadian provinces,"" with six per cent opposing that and nine per cent uncertain. Three-quarters - 75 per cent - said government should ""provide financial supports to help people who lose their jobs"" as a result of Trump's levies. Fifteen per cent opposed that and 10 per cent weren't sure. Finally, 73 per cent felt there should be ""financial supports to help businesses who struggle"" due to the tariffs, with 17 per cent opposed and 10 per cent uncertain.

"Unlike Ford, Poilievre calls for restraint in spending on trade-war supports",2025.0,"Retaliation is one thing. Most Canadian politicians agree it’s a necessary weapon to fight a trade war against Donald Trump. But how will Canada deal will the economic casualties? There are already stark differences on that. Ontario Premier Doug Ford just won a landslide provincial election promising he’d go big to support affected workers. Federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is sounding warnings about the cost. When reporters asked Mr. Ford about supports on Tuesday, the Ontario Premier already seemed to have an image in his mind of what trade-war relief packages should look like. He said it should be “no different than the pandemic.” It’s not that surprising. People are feeling vulnerable, especially in Ontario, the country’s manufacturing centre. Economists are predicting the trade war could lead to the loss of half a million jobs across the country, or even more. And Mr. Ford just won big promising to “protect Ontario” from the pain. But Mr. Poilievre is on a different page. He gave his own press conference on Tuesday while Mr. Ford was still speaking, and said that he was in favour of some supports for affected workers – but warned about going big in pandemic style. “We must not allow politicians to dishonestly use this crisis to once again launch a debt-fuelled, money-printing spending spree that will drive up inflation and further destroy the working class and hit the poorest people hardest,” he told reporters. That’s pretty stark. And Mr. Poilievre’s reticence is not just about unrelated spending. Unlike Mr. Ford, he doesn’t want to devote all the money Canada collects from countertariffs on U.S. goods on supports for companies and workers affected by the trade war. Mr. Poilievre thinks only a small part of the proceeds should be devoted to that. “Almost every penny of the tariffs collected should go to tax cuts, with a small sum set aside for targeted relief to workers hardest hit by the trade war,” he said. Tax cuts are always central to Mr. Poilievre’s rhetoric. He has promised “massive” tax cuts, although he hasn’t provided details. The Conservative Leader apparently sees tax cuts as the chief tool to get Canadians through a trade war, too – rather than income supports for workers who have lost their jobs. But that probably doesn’t offer the kind of direct reassurance that a lot of suddenly vulnerable workers will be seeking. It certainly isn’t the formula that just won Mr. Ford an election in Canada’s most populous province. Mr. Poilievre is now at odds with the Ontario Premier on an issue that is at the top of voters’ concerns. It’s also a different approach from the one taken by the person Mr. Poilievre is probably going to face in a general election: Mark Carney. The front-runner in the federal Liberal leadership race said he would introduce a tax cut, but that would be separate from trade-war income supports. “It’s fundamentally important … to take the proceeds from our countertariffs and ensure that they go directly to those workers who are most affected by the American tariffs,” the former Bank of Canada governor told reporters in Calgary on Tuesday. Even the deep damage of a lasting trade war shouldn’t require supports on the same scale as the roughly $210-billion the federal government poured out in wage subsidies and emergency benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. But the revenues from countertariffs applied to U.S. goods in a trade war won’t fill the government’s coffers with a huge windfall, either. The current plan is to levy 25-per-cent tariffs on $155-billion in U.S. imports. But in practice, the tariffs will deter Canadian customers from buying many of those products. If the tariffs bring in $15-billion, it won’t be enough to fully cover the costs of benefits for 500,000 unemployed workers. It wouldn’t fund a massive tax cut, either. Certainly, the proceeds wouldn’t pay for both. For the moment, that’s still an abstract issue. But it could start to feel very real for a large number of Canadians very quickly. And Mr. Poilievre’s “small sum” for workers might seem a little skimpy to anxious Canadians. Certainly, Mr. Ford just won Ontario by promising he’d go big.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Campbell, Clark",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 6, 2025",Trade disputes; Provincial elections; Tax cuts; Pandemics; Tariffs; International trade; Trade policy; Government spending; Political leadership,,2025-03-06,The Globe and Mail
"Erin O'Toole: The future for nuclear is bright, but only if we learn lessons of the past",2025.0,"As Canada prepares to meet its growing energy needs, there is no longer debate about the central role nuclear will play Critics have become converts in what is being called the ""nuclear renaissance,"" but before we break ground on the next generation of reactors, Canadian policymakers must answer one crucial question: Who bears the risk for cost overruns, and how do we prevent them in the first place? If we fail to get this right, we will struggle to expand nuclear power precisely when we need it most. The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) has projected that electricity demand in Ontario alone will rise by 75 per cent in the coming decades. This estimate only projects meeting demand forecast today, but as AI, data centres and quantum computing evolve alongside electrification, the real demand will likely be higher. To meet this challenge, we must plan to nearly double our emissions-free generation capacity. Ontario has indicated that it plans to add more large-scale nuclear generation capacity alongside the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The future for nuclear is bright, but only if we learn from lessons of the past. Canada was the third country to achieve nuclear fission, but our history is also littered with cautionary tales of construction delays and cost overruns. I grew up in Bowmanville during the construction of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station. Its economic benefits were undeniable, then and now, but so were the crippling budget overruns. What was planned as a $4.5 billion project ballooned to over $14 billion by completion. The resulting stranded costs contributed to the breakup of Ontario Hydro, the restructuring of the electricity sector, and a debt-servicing charge on the electricity bill of Ontarians that they paid for sixteen years. Other provinces did not fare much better. Generating stations in Quebec and New Brunswick faced construction delays and cost overruns, leading Quebec to eventually abandon nuclear. In New Brunswick, the costs associated with refurbishing their plant led to rate pressures and even a Hail Mary pass in 2009 to sell New Brunswick Power to Hydro Quebec. The deal was abandoned due to public opposition to the sale, but it demonstrates the enormous challenges provinces face. The United States had a similar history with respect to costs and delays, which is why in 2024, the Biden administration launched a working group to tackle nuclear cost overruns and construction delays. This is now a bipartisan effort in the U.S. to bring together project developers, engineers, utilities, investors, and labour leaders to identify ways to discuss project delivery and reduce overrun risk. Canada has had great success with its CANDU fleet of reactors and a better overall track record than the Americans. Ontario was able to eliminate the burning of coal because of nuclear energy, and this still ranks as the largest greenhouse gas emission reduction achievement in Canadian history. That said, we must come up with a smarter approach to building and operating these plants. Canada needs to ask the same questions that are being explored in the United States. Governments will always have a critical role to play in planning for the electricity needs for their province and regulating the safety of operations, but better contracting models are needed. The restructuring of Ontario Hydro back in the 1990s shows us what is possible. Ontario Power Generation nuclear assets in Tiverton were transferred to a private consortium known as Bruce Power. Its ownership includes two operator unions, a Canadian pension fund and a Canadian energy company. This private sector operator has safely operated and refurbished reactors at the site, and works closely with other utilities to ensure that operators across the fleet of reactors in Ontario can learn from one another. Their model and other international projects show that a high level of training, accountability measures and milestone-based financing can deliver safe and effective performance without runaway costs. Canada must develop uranium enrichment to succeed Nuclear power and LNG are key to a low-carbon future Nuclear energy - We CANDU it and we should Before we start writing the next chapter of nuclear energy in Canada, lets be sure we take away all the lessons from the first chapter. The private sector must play a role in both the construction and operation of the next generation of nuclear stations in Ontario and be part of the risk sharing solution.

"'We will win': Carney slams Trump, Poilievre and tariffs during Calgary campaign stop",2025.0,"Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney railed against Trump and sweeping tariffs during a campaign stop in Calgary on Tuesday, with less than five days remaining in the party leadership race. In a speech to hundreds of Liberal supporters, Carney articulated a vision for Canada's future focused on national unity and sovereignty, bolstered by the backdrop of a burgeoning trade dispute. ""Canadians are united and determined,"" he told the crowd. ""In a trade war ... we will win."" U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration proceeded with imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports Tuesday, with a 10 per cent levy on Canadian energy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded by immediately placing 25 per cent tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with another $125 billion against U.S. products to come in 21 days. Carney condemned the U.S. tariffs while expressing support for Canada's response. ""These tariffs are an unjust attack on Canadian workers, on families and our businesses,"" he said. ""I'm proud that Canada is rightly retaliating with tariffs that will have maximum impact on the United States and minimum impact here in Canada. Related Elbows up, Canada! In the face of Trump tariffs, call to arms hits social media Trudeau will stay as prime minister for transition, but the timeline is up to his successor Speaking to reporters, Carney said that, if elected Prime Minister, he would ensure that all proceeds from counter-tariffs go to helping Canadian workers. He went on to say Canada's economy ""is stronger than the American economy in the medium term."" ""We are going to be stronger ... particularly if the U.S. government continues to pursue these types of policies,"" Carney said. Carney emphasized the importance of defending Canadian sovereignty, after Trump has repeatedly made remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state. ""We are in charge of our destiny, not the Americans,"" Carney said ""They want our resources. They want our water. They want our land. They want our country,"" he added. ""They would destroy our way of life."" Federal Liberal leader candidate Mark Carney speaks to media prior to an event in northeast Calgary on Tuesday, March 4, 2025. A key campaign promise is the elimination of the ""divisive consumer carbon tax"" on households, farmers and small businesses, a move Carney argued would help Canadians save money and support Canadian businesses. During his speech, Carney also highlighted economic opportunities of interprovincial trade barriers. He said removing barriers to internal trade could expand the national economy by more than $200 billion Carney described his Alberta upbringing with ""prairie values"" such as ""hard work"" and ""tolerance"", while criticizing Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who he described as a ""lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never actually having earned a paycheck."" He compared Poilievre's approach to governing with that of Trump, suggesting both represent divisive political strategies that harm progress. ""His reflex is to cut and destroy,"" Carney said of Poilievre. ""Sound familiar?"" Carney further criticized Poilievre's alignment with Donald Trump, stating ""a person who worships Donald Trump like Pierre Poilievre will kneel before him, not stand up to him. The leadership candidate called for ""positive leadership that ends division."" A Postmedia-Leger poll released this week showed the federal Conservatives restoring a double-digit lead over the Liberals. A federal election has not yet been called but must be held by October 20, 2025. Carney referred to the next federal election as the ""most consequential election in our lifetimes."" With around 50 days of campaigning behind him, Carney has just a few days to go in the Liberal leadership race. Trudeau has said he would resign once the Liberal leadership race concludes, but he noted on Tuesday that the exact timing of his departure has not yet been determined.

"Brian Lee Crowley: For Poilievre, the path to victory runs through Washington",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre needs to shed his aversion to speaking to American audiences. It would be good for his electoral prospects, but much more importantly, it would be good for Canada. When the next federal election looked to be a referendum on the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the likely outcome was a huge parliamentary majority for the Conservatives. That era is over and the likely ballot question now is who can best defend Canada's interests in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's erratic and vengeful behaviour towards us. The Liberals now benefit from being the party of experience, and may soon have a new leader with extensive international experience and a record of being stand-offish toward the United States. You can count on the fact that when an election is called, the Liberals will run against Donald Trump and portray their Conservative rival as ""Trump lite."" According to recent polls, the gap between the two main parties is rapidly closing and Poilievre and his team have been slow and uncertain in their response. When it comes to making appearances in the U.S., the strategy in the past has clearly been to avoid that country altogether, presumably on the grounds that any popularity Poilievre might enjoy with the American right would be used against him in Canada. The new political situation changes this calculus radically, however. Poilievre now needs to neutralize the charge that he is a thinly disguised MAGA Republican in snowshoes. There is no better way to do this than to go to Washington and prove that he is a vigorous defender of Canada's national interests. Get on a prestigious think-tank or national press gallery platform. Call out Donald Trump. Explain that the Conservatives believe in a close relationship with the United States but that does not mean they will accept a perversion of that relationship for Trump's transactional benefit. Tell the Americans directly that ever since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the U.S. has invited Canada to work with it to build closer relations on a broad front. Donald Trump is trying to change the rules of the game, unilaterally and grotesquely exploiting the vulnerability that America invited Canada to accept. As Frank Buckley, a Canadian teaching at George Mason University near Washington, D.C., said to me recently, ""When you agree to economic integration through free trade, the implicit promise is there can be no subsequent opportunistic shakedowns. He needs to call the Americans perfidious and tell Donald Trump he is making an enemy of his closest friend and there is nothing he can possibly get from it."" Our American friends need to hear what they can expect from a Conservative government, namely that it will accept justified criticism on matters where Canada has demonstrably failed to live up to our part of the bargain with the U.S., such as defence spending, Arctic security, organized crime and border management. But he also needs to make it clear that his government will expect Washington to honour its commitments to Canada and to understand that this country's sovereignty in not open for discussion. Unlike the premiers, who came down hat-in-hand and accepted private meetings with humiliatingly mid-level White House staff, Poilievre should not seek to sit down with Trump or his staff. The purpose of his trip should be to put Washington on notice that a Canadian Conservative government will be willing to do business, but will not indulge Trumpian antics and will defend Canada's interests and its integrity. The added benefit would be that Donald Trump admires people who stand up to him. He despises Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wants favours from the president when it suits him but is happy to mock and criticize Trump when he's not around. And he likely thinks that Liberal leadership hopeful Mark Carney personifies the smug technocrats he came to battle in Washington. A show of strength would cause Poilievre's stock to rise within the administration and congressional circles, where Canada desperately needs credible spokespeople. And he would have the perfect retort to his opponents at home who accuse him of being a closet Trump admirer and acolyte: ""I bearded the lion in his den, waved the Canadian flag and told him a Poilievre-led government would be a fierce negotiator and a firm defender of our pride and prosperity."" Pierre Poilievre can no longer rag the puck. He has to be bold and show what he is made of and why he is still worthy of Canadians' votes. The road to victory for him lies, in part, through Washington.

"Poilievre pushing voters to Liberals, poll finds",2025.0,"Worsening feelings for Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre are helping push Canadian voters toward the federal Liberal party, a new poll suggests. In an online survey published Wednesday, Pollara Strategic Insights found that 34 per cent of respondents were more open to voting for the governing Liberals by mid-February than at the end of last year. When asked why, 55 per cent said they're ""feeling worse about Pierre Poilievre,"" while 50 per cent cited how they like one of the Liberal leadership candidates and 50 per cent pointed to concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. At the same time, 42 per cent of respondents said they feel ""angry"" or ""frustrated"" when they hear Poilievre speak, compared with 40 per cent for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and 59 per cent for outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Thirty-two per cent said they were ""excited"" or ""comfortable"" when hearing Poilievre, while 29 per cent said the same about Singh, and 26 per cent felt that way about Trudeau. The online poll of 1,506 adults was conducted from Feb. 12 to 24. Online surveys can't be assigned a margin of error, but a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, according to Pollara. The Pollara survey echoed recent polls that have suggested the Conservatives' lead in voting intentions has narrowed in recent weeks. Forty-two per cent of decided voters said they would vote Conservative, compared with 32 per cent for the Liberals, 11 per cent for the New Democratic Party and four per cent for the Greens. When asked how they would vote with former central banker Mark Carney as Liberal leader, the poll showed a statistical tie between the Tories and Grits. Thirty-seven per cent of decided voters would support the Poilievre Conservatives, compared with 37 per cent for Carney's Liberals, 14 per cent for the NDP and three per cent for the Greens. Twelve per cent of respondents also said they would be ""excited"" if Carney won the Liberal leadership, compared with three per cent for former finance minister Chrystia Freeland and less than two per cent for former House leader Karina Gould and former MP Frank Baylis. Among self-identified Liberal voters in the survey, 41 per cent said they would be ""excited"" about a Carney win, while seven per cent said they would feel that way about Freeland, and two per cent about Gould.

"Bell: Trump tariff war rages - Carney, Poilievre duke it out for power",2025.0,"The clock counts down to zero hour. There is no eleventh-hour reprieve. Even Cinderella could not escape midnight. The tariffs promised by U.S. president Donald Trump is now a promise kept. In the darkness, most Canadians who are still awake are no doubt angry. On this side of the border, along with the tariffs, we cannot avoid the chaos of our own politics. You see, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is leaving in a few days. We will have a new Liberal prime minister in less than a week. If the tariffs are on and stay on until around Easter, Canadians will go to the polls and vote for who will be the new government, Liberal or Conservative. Meanwhile, the Liberals and their likely leader Mark Carney have already made history making political hay out of the Trump tariff threat. A long-time big lead in the polls for the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre has vanished with Trump's talk of tariffs against this country and his frequent references to wanting Canada as the cherished, tariff-free 51st state. The Liberals have cast Poilievre as a Canadian Trump and themselves as the champions of Canada and they're betting on Canadians being swept up in the tariff war and forgetting the long list of sins committed by the Liberals. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks at a press conference in Ottawa, Ontario on Sunday, March 2, 2025. By the way, circle your calendar. The Liberals will almost certainly elect Mark Carney as the leader this coming Sunday. An election could be called later next week for some time in April. After all, strike while the iron is hot. But the Conservatives are striking back and they are bringing out the heavy artillery. Former prime minister Stephen Harper is doing the striking. Related Trump's tariffs start Tuesday. Here's what Canadians need to know Bell: Angry Canadians lose their minds, Liberals paint Poilievre as Trump Let it be noted the Conservatives are no less patriotic than the Liberals. In fact, if a person for half a second scanned the Liberal record of these many years, patriotism would be far from the first thing to come to mind when talking about the Liberals. They are led by a guy who said we had no core identity and no mainstream in Canada. So stop the name-calling about conservatives being traitors and collaborators. Such B.S. is particularly galling when over the last decade Canada has become weaker not stronger. Harper, who is nothing if not a Canadian patriot, mentions how Canada has what it takes to lead but under the Liberals the country has fallen way behind. Canada has vast oil reserves but proposed pipelines got shot down and we are forced to sell to the U.S. Natural gas could have been exported but the Liberals said there was no business case. Grocery prices are much higher than south of the border and we have the carbon tax. Housing costs, government debt, a staggering number of investments driven away. Then there's Mark Carney, the Liberal messiah, the man many Canadians believe can save the nation even though they have heard little from him. The Liberals have transformed themselves as the saviours of Canada. And many Liberals believe Carney should become prime minister and stay prime minister because he is so smart and so wise he was the main man saving us during the global economic meltdown when Harper was leading the country. Only problem. He wasn't. Former prime minister Stephen Harper delivers the keynote address at a conference in Ottawa, Wednesday, March 22, 2023. Harper was prime minister when there was the global economic meltdown and says Carney is trying to take credit for what he had little or nothing to do with back then. Harper says Carney was not involved in the management of the economy during that crisis. In fact, for the former prime minister, Carney's experience is being wrong on all the big issues. You know, the issues Liberals must hope Canadians don't think about for the next couple of months. Carney pushes back against Harper. He will be in conservative Calgary Tuesday night. Carney says he is the man of experience, attacking Poilievre and claiming the Conservative leader doesn't have the ability to stand to Trump. This weekend Poilievre supports Canada fighting back against the tariffs but also points out all the ways Liberals do not deserve a fourth term. The Conservative leader advises Canadians not to be fooled by last-minute promises. He goes further saying Trump would like to see Carney and the Liberals win the next election. Trump would like a weak prime minister. He would pop the champagne even though he doesn't drink. Carney and the Liberals no doubt just look at the polls and smile. In reality, they don't have a good hand. But they will play their card, their only card.

"William Watson: Let's hope Poilievre 'cuts, cuts, cuts.' Someone's going to have to",2025.0,"The Conservatives are said to be having trouble pivoting away from the shooting-fish-in-a-barrel fun of campaigning against Justin Trudeau to the more difficult challenge of beating Mark Carney, who may not be a natural politician but who is a person of substance and achievement. I've never run an election campaign so maybe this is all more complicated than it seems, but don't you pivot by figuring out Carney's downsides, including in his policies, and going after them until you find something people respond to? Whatever troubles the Conservatives are having, the Liberal leadership ""debates"" last week suggest their plan for Poilievre is set: he's a lifelong politician (as opposed to lifelong technocrat); he worships Donald Trump; and if he gets into power he'll ""cut, cut, cut."" That Poilievre has been in Parliament since he was 25 years old is not such a problem. Winston Churchill became an MP at 25 and spent 62 years in all in parliament. I know: Poilievre is no Churchill. But the point is: political experience can be a good thing. If you've spend your adult life in Ottawa, you probably have a nose for deadwood. That Poilievre has been an attack-dog politician most of his career is a bigger problem. Attack-dog is not the normal style of prime ministers. PMs hire people to do their attacking for them. Poilievre needs to find his own Poilievre. (An email to Conservative party members from Stephen Harper this week suggests maybe he's it: ""Let me be very clear: the hard calls during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis were made by Jim,"" i.e., the finance minister, the late Jim Flaherty, not Mark Carney.) Of course, what's ""normal style"" in prime ministers is under challenge these days. The Americans have an attack-dog president who may be changing the norm for democracies. And yet most Americans I talked to on a recent trip like him in spite of the canine parts of his character. As hyperbole, the Liberal claim that Poilievre ""worships"" Trump is in fact Trump-ish. Like many conservatives, Poilievre clearly sees positive things in Trump: his bias to action, his disdain for woke and DEI, his search for waste, his willingness, even eagerness, to slaughter sacred cows. (Everyone should agree the end of the U.S. penny makes perfect, ahem, sense. But it has made sense for years, and it took Trump's felt-tip pen to sweep it away in an executive order.) Poilievre is hardly an acolyte, however. Trump himself has been saying disapproving things about him, including that he's a non-MAGA tough-talker who will fold. If you're on the left, Trump dissing Poilievre is all part of a plot to make Canadians like the Conservative leader more. But if Trump really wanted Poilievre elected, he wouldn't be going on so about the 51st state. As The New York Times' Ross Douthat wrote last week, his pointless ""war of words"" with Justin Trudeau risks resurrecting and re-electing the Liberals, which he surely will not enjoy. The idea that Poilievre is going to come in and ""cut, cut, cut"" is a dog-eared page from the ancient Liberal playbook. This time round, though, it's hard to see it working. Most Canadians realize that Trump's threatened tariffs, if they last more than months, mean hard times ahead. When our way-biggest customer taxes what we're selling, that makes us poorer. When uncertainty generated on purpose means our access to the U.S. market is up in the air, investing in Canada becomes less attractive. Yes, the trade diversification everyone's pushing will replace some U.S. sales. But if appreciable chunks of what we've been doing in the integrated North American market move to the U.S., that will hurt. Studies of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement say it brought us a six per cent increase in manufacturing productivity, which is big. And that was with an average tariff reduction well below Trump's 25 per cent barrier. As Adam Smith said: ""The division of labour is limited by the extent of the market."" Turn that FTA effect around and losing access to the gigantic U.S. market will hurt. If we are poorer as a nation, and we will be, somebody's going to have to cut, cut, cut. We simply will not be able to afford everything we have splurged on in the past decade. Plus: we're going to have to cut taxes on businesses to offset the rise in uncertainty owing to Trump. And we're going to have to get serious about investing in hard power, i.e., a military that can do serious damage to potential aggressors against us and actual aggressors against our allies. A Labour prime minister of the United Kingdom has just raised the ante on defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP and his Conservative counterpart wants three per cent. At the same time, Liberal leadership candidate Frank Baylis is right to caution that turning on the money pumps will waste billions of dollars. But we need a credible path to a stronger military - pork be damned - and we need it now. Elites and populists are both right and wrong Return of the ugly American Our Trump transition plan should focus on safety nets The dumbest way of cutting would be to leave it to attrition. A plan to cut spending where the average age of federal employee is highest, which is what attrition amounts to, is dodgier than DOGE. So we need someone who will cut, cut, cut. Fat first.

"Bell: Trump tariff war rages a s Carney, Poilievre duke it out for power",2025.0,"The clock counts down to zero hour. There is no eleventh-hour reprieve. Even Cinderella could not escape midnight. The tariffs promised by U.S. president Donald Trump is now a promise kept. In the darkness, most Canadians who are still awake are no doubt angry. On this side of the border, along with the tariffs, we cannot avoid the chaos of our own politics. You see, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is leaving in a few days. We will have a new Liberal prime minister in less than a week. If the tariffs are on and stay on until around Easter, Canadians will go to the polls and vote for who will be the new government, Liberal or Conservative. Meanwhile, the Liberals and their likely leader Mark Carney have already made history making political hay out of the Trump tariff threat. A long-time big lead in the polls for the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre has vanished with Trump's talk of tariffs against this country and his frequent references to wanting Canada as the cherished, tariff-free 51st state. The Liberals have cast Poilievre as a Canadian Trump and themselves as the champions of Canada and they're betting on Canadians being swept up in the tariff war and forgetting the long list of sins committed by the Liberals. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks at a press conference in Ottawa, Ontario on Sunday, March 2, 2025. By the way, circle your calendar. The Liberals will almost certainly elect Mark Carney as the leader this coming Sunday. An election could be called later next week for some time in April. After all, strike while the iron is hot. But the Conservatives are striking back and they are bringing out the heavy artillery. Former prime minister Stephen Harper is doing the striking. Related Trump's tariffs start Tuesday. Here's what Canadians need to know Bell: Angry Canadians lose their minds, Liberals paint Poilievre as Trump Let it be noted the Conservatives are no less patriotic than the Liberals. In fact, if a person for half a second scanned the Liberal record of these many years, patriotism would be far from the first thing to come to mind when talking about the Liberals. They are led by a guy who said we had no core identity and no mainstream in Canada. So stop the name-calling about conservatives being traitors and collaborators. Such B.S. is particularly galling when over the last decade Canada has become weaker not stronger. Harper, who is nothing if not a Canadian patriot, mentions how Canada has what it takes to lead but under the Liberals the country has fallen way behind. Canada has vast oil reserves but proposed pipelines got shot down and we are forced to sell to the U.S. Natural gas could have been exported but the Liberals said there was no business case. Grocery prices are much higher than south of the border and we have the carbon tax. Housing costs, government debt, a staggering number of investments driven away.

Former B.C. cabinet minister told he can’t run for Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives:   Mike de Jong was told his application to seek the party’s nomination to run in the Abbotsford-South Langley was declined,2025.0,"The federal Conservatives have told former B.C. cabinet minister Mike de Jong he can’t seek the nomination to run as an MP. Mr. de Jong was informed by the party late Monday that his application to run in the nomination contest for Abbotsford-South Langley was declined. No reasons were given in the initial rejection, but Mr. de Jong told The Globe and Mail in an interview Tuesday he was later told by a party insider there were some doubts about his qualifications. His career in provincial politics spans three decades, and he served in several cabinet positions in B.C. Liberal governments. ""Having served the area for over 30 years in an official capacity, to be told you’re not worthy or qualified to compete is disappointing and surprising,"" he said. Mr. de Jong launched his bid to seek the nomination a year ago, and said he has signed up more than 2,000 members. ""If people within the party thought it was a bad fit, I’ve been at this long enough. They could have told me,"" he said. He refused to speculate on reasons he could have been rejected. The Conservative Party did not immediately return a request for comment. Mr. de Jong said he hadn’t been a member of a federal political party for 40 years until he joined the federal Conservatives to vote for Pierre Poilievre in the party’s 2022 leadership race. His endorsement made news at the time, and the party seemed happy with it, he said. The B.C. Liberals, now known as B.C. United, are not affiliated with the federal Liberal Party. They have for years been a coalition of right-of-centre voters more closely aligned with the federal Conservatives. Another former B.C. United MLA, Ellis Ross, is running for the Tories in the B.C. riding of Skeena–Bulkley Valley, while former provincial cabinet minister Iain Black is running in Coquitlam–Port Coquitlam. Abbotsford-South Langley is one of the new ridings for the upcoming general election, replacing the former riding of Abbotsford. That seat has been held by the Conservatives since the riding was created in 2004. The current MP, Ed Fast, announced last year he was not seeking re-election. Conservative Party members will vote in the nomination contest this Saturday. Others who’ve said they are running are parliamentary staffers Shanjeelin Dwivedi and Mike Murray, Sukhman Gill, who describes himself as a farmer and businessman, Gurnoor Sidhu, a former city council candidate and Steve Schafer, a management consultant and long-time party volunteer. Mr. de Jong said he’s not sure whether he’ll endorse any other candidate. ""I’m not sure how I feel today about ratifying a process I don’t see as legitimate any longer,"" he said. Though the next federal election isn’t scheduled until October, it is widely expected that it will come this spring. Parliament is currently prorogued until March 24 and all opposition parties have vowed to vote out the minority Liberals at the next opportunity. But, on Sunday, the Liberal Party elects a new leader and that person could choose not to recall Parliament and instead call an election on their own.

Harper targets Carney over past record:   Former PM says Liberal leadership c andidate exaggerating his role during 2008 financial crisis,2025.0,"Former prime minister Stephen Harper is taking aim at Mark Carney, arguing the Liberal leadership hopeful is overselling what he did in the 2008 fiscal crisis and underselling late former finance minister Jim Flaherty's work. Harper penned a fundraising letter to Conservatives Monday, arguing Carney has been exaggerating what he did as Bank of Canada governor, responding to the 2008 financial crisis. ""I have listened, with increasing disbelief, to Mark Carney's attempts to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with back then,"" Harper wrote in the letter. ""He has been doing this at the expense of the late Jim Flaherty, among the greatest finance ministers in Canada's history, who sadly is not here to defend his record."" Harper argued the truly hard calls during the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis were Flaherty's and that Carney was simply not involved in the day-to-day management of steering the country through the financial crisis. Harper also said Carney was talking about his record in 2008 to avoid talking about the Liberal record of the past 10 years, where Carney has served as an adviser. The 2008 financial crisis was a global banking crisis that began because several major U.S. banks either went bankrupt or came perilously close. Those banks had extended risky or subprime mortgage loans to American consumers and were unprepared when housing prices dipped and many of those homeowners couldn't pay. While campaigning for the Liberal leadership, Carney has said he has the skills and experience to navigate Canada through the Trump administration's economic threats, because of his experience in 2008 and in the U.K. following the 2016 Brexit vote. Then prime minister Harper picked Carney to be Bank of Canada governor in 2007. Carney has said Harper also offered to make him finance minister in 2012, a claim Harper has not refuted. The Carney campaign responded to Harper's letter in a statement on Monday, arguing Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is scared to run against someone with Carney's resumé. ""Stephen Harper could have approached Pierre Poilievre about serving as his finance minister. He approached Mr. Carney instead,"" the statement said. ""In 2025, Mr. Harper is being called on to save Pierre Poilievre from a historic drop in support, but no amount of revisionist history can take away from Mr. Carney's proven record of economic leadership."" Carney left Canada in 2013 to become governor of the Bank of England. At the time, Harper issued a statement thanking him for his service to Canada. ""Governor Carney has done an admirable job in fulfilling the Bank of Canada's mandate and has been a valued partner as the government has worked to steer Canada away from the worst impacts of the global economic recession,"" Harper said. Flaherty similarly praised Carney at the time, saying he had been an invaluable support to him, both as governor and as a senior bureaucrat in the finance department. ""I appreciate the work he has done and the advice he has given to keep Canada's economy strong, protect Canadian jobs and maintain the stability of our monetary system,"" Flaherty said at a news conference in 2012, after Carney's appointment to the Bank of England was announced. Chisholm Pothier, Flaherty's former press secretary, defended Carney when Poilievre's wife, Anaida, made an argument similar to Harper's last month. ""Carney played a big role. Flaherty and Harper provided the political leadership that was key, but Carney was on deck with insight and smart monetary policy,"" Pothier said on X. Pothier is now a spokesperson for the newly formed Canadian Future Party, a political party planning to field candidates in the next election. During the 2008 financial crisis, Flaherty offered Canadian banks some help buying $25 billion worth of mortgages to ease pressure on their books. He then launched a massive economic stimulus program with tens of billions in infrastructure spending. He also intervened when major automakers GM and Chrysler faced bankruptcy, buying stakes in both firms. Carney, as then Bank of Canada governor, lowered interest rates and offered what he called a ""conditional commitment"" to keep those interest rates low. He also changed some rules for Canadian banks to help them deal with liquidity pressures. Stephen Gordon, a professor of economics at the University of Laval, said both sides of the argument are right. He said Carney clearly played a significant part in Canada's response in 2008, but it's also true that elected officials made the biggest decisions. ""Harper is saying that most of the heavy lifting was done by the government, under Jim Flaherty, that's fair,"" he said. CAPTION: In a fundraising letter to Conservatives, former prime minister Stephen Harper said the hard calls during the global financial crisis of 2008 were made by then finance minister Jim Flaherty, not Mark Carney, who was Bank of Canada governor at the time.

"Canada’s relations with Tehran stuck in deep freeze, despite Iranian hopes:   Canada’s diplomatic relations with Iran were severed in 2012 by then-prime minister Stephen Harper, who criticized Iran’s human-rights record, its hostility to Israel and its support for terrorist groups",2025.0,"The former Canadian embassy in Tehran is empty and locked. The tiles and stairs at the front entrance are broken and crumbling. ""Please do not smoke here,"" says a sign on the wall. On the ground-floor windows, a visitor might notice the faint traces of the maple leaves that were removed long ago – the last fading sign of the Canadian presence. After a 13-year diplomatic freeze, Canada is invisible in Iran. It is one of the few major countries without an embassy here. An attempted rapprochement between the two countries in 2017 was shattered by events over the following years, including Iran’s shootdown of a passenger jet with dozens of Canadians on board. Today there is only silence in the diplomatic channels. Many people in Iran still hope that the two governments can eventually patch up their differences. Canada has the world’s second-biggest Iranian diaspora, numbering about 300,000 people, and commentators have often noted the potential linkages between the two countries in business and other sectors. ""I think there’s a great opportunity,"" says Masoumeh Ebtekar, a former Iranian vice-president who is now an academic and an influential reformist. ""I don’t think there are any negative feelings about Canada,"" she told The Globe and Mail in Tehran. ""I think the Iranian government would welcome any initiative to improve relations and re-establish the ties that we had at one time."" Canada’s diplomatic relations with Iran were severed in 2012 by then-prime minister Stephen Harper, who criticized Iran’s human-rights record, its hostility to Israel and its support for terrorist groups. In the federal election three years later, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau promised to restore relations. His government sent officials to Tehran for preliminary talks in 2017. But the negotiations were shelved in the following year after Canadian-Iranian professor Kavous Seyed-Emami died under mysterious circumstances in a Tehran prison and his widow was banned from returning to Canada, provoking protests from the federal government. Two years later, the Iranian military shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 near Tehran, killing all 176 people on board, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents. Since then, Canada has imposed a series of sanctions on Iranian officials and military commanders, accusing them of committing gross human-rights violations and sponsoring terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. It has also maintained its earlier trade restrictions on the country for its nuclear program. And it has taken legal action against Iran at the International Court of Justice and the International Civil Aviation Organization over the Flight 752 shootdown. Official relations remain so frosty today that staff from Iran’s foreign ministry were unwilling to meet The Globe to discuss Canadian issues during a recent two-week visit to Tehran. They also declined to answer any written questions from The Globe. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said she has not had any formal or informal contacts with Iranian officials since she took office in 2021. ""Our strategy is to put maximum pressure on Iran,"" she told The Globe in an interview. ""We believe they’re part of the problem in the Middle East and around the world. A lot of Canadians have their loved ones in prison in Iran."" Many analysts have noted the potential benefits for both countries if diplomatic links are some day restored. Canadian investors for years have eyed the business opportunities in Iran’s vast oil and gas sector. As recently as 2016, the federal government voiced its hopes that Canada’s aviation industry could sell airplanes to Iran as soon as sanctions were lifted. On the Iranian side, Prof. Ebtekar talks optimistically about the potential for Canada-Iran co-operation in scientific research and green technology. The large Iranian diaspora in Canada is another key factor. There are so many Iranian-Canadians in Toronto – about 90,000 – that the city is sometimes jokingly known in Iran as ""Tehranto."" While some in the diaspora are strongly opposed to the Iranian government, others would like to see an improvement in relations, if only to make travel and other connections easier. An analysis in 2022, published by the Canadian International Council, an independent think tank, argued that the normalization of relations with Iran would be in Canada’s national interests – especially at times of crises, such as the Flight 752 shootdown, when Canadian consular officials struggled for permission to enter Iran. But the analysis acknowledged that a reopening of the Canadian embassy is unlikely, partly because it would be vulnerable to potential attacks by demonstrators, as other Western embassies have suffered over the years. Foad Izadi, a professor of world studies at the University of Tehran, said he is surprised at the continuing freeze between the two countries. ""There could be a lot of economic, political and cultural linkages,"" he told The Globe. ""We love Canada. It’s a good country."" But others are less optimistic. Manouchehr Mottaki, a former Iranian foreign minister with links to conservative factions, is skeptical about the chances of reconciliation. He recalls tensions between the two governments when he was foreign minister from 2005 to 2010, and his memory even goes back to 1980, when Canada helped rescue six American diplomats during the hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy. ""In my 40 years in foreign policy, I cannot see a very positive picture of Canada in Iran,"" said Mr. Mottaki, who is now a member of parliament. ""The feeling of our people is that Canada doesn’t have an independent foreign policy."" He scoffs at the rapprochement efforts from 2015 to 2017. ""We didn’t take it seriously, because there weren’t any practical steps by the Canadians. There’s a lack of political will.""

Harper questions Carney’s achievements:   Liberal leadership candidate’s campaign defends former central banker’s ‘proven record of economic leadership’,2025.0,"Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper has accused perceived Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney of falsely claiming credit for managing the 2008 financial crisis and linked him to the Trudeau government’s failure to build energy projects along with increases in the federal deficit. In a hard-hitting fundraising letter issued Monday to Conservative Party faithful, Mr. Harper said the former central banker is not the right leader to handle U.S. President Donald Trump and his threats of punitive tariffs. He took direct aim at the former Bank of Canada governor who during the Liberal leadership campaign has played up his role in navigating the 2008 financial crisis alongside Mr. Harper and Jim Flaherty, who was then the finance minister. Mr. Harper appointed Mr. Carney to lead the bank, plucking him from inside the Finance Department to take on the job in February, 2008. When Mr. Carney departed to become the governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Harper praised him, writing that he was a “valued partner” and helped his government “steer Canada away from the worst impacts of the global economic recession.” Economists also told The Globe and Mail on Monday that Mr. Carney played a key role in helping Canada weather the financial crisis. But in the fundraising letter, Mr. Harper said Mr. Carney was not involved in the day-to-day management of Canada’s economy during that time. “I have listened, with increasing disbelief, to Mark Carney’s attempts to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with back then,” he said. “He has been doing this at the great expense of the late Jim Flaherty, among the greatest finance ministers in Canadian history.” Mr. Harper wrote: “Let me be clear: The hard calls during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis were made by Jim.” Mr. Carney has said Mr. Harper offered him the finance minister’s post in 2012. The former prime minister did not say anything in his letter about that assertion. Mr. Harper’s consulting firm did not immediately return a request for clarification on Monday. In a statement to The Globe, Mr. Carney’s campaign said Mr. Harper was being brought in to bolster Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s own campaign. The Tories have seen their lead in public-opinion polling shrink since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January he’d resign. “Stephen Harper could have approached Pierre Poilievre about serving as his Finance Minister. He approached Mr. Carney instead,” the statement said. “In 2025, Mr. Harper is being called on to save Pierre Poilievre from a historic drop in support, but no amount of revisionist history can take away from Mr. Carney’s proven record of economic leadership.” Economists say both Mr. Carney and Mr. Flaherty played central, if differing, roles in navigating the economic crisis for Canada. University of British Columbia economist Kevin Milligan said the Bank of Canada under Mr. Carney was heavily involved in the management of the financial crisis. A look at the Bank of Canada archives shows evidence of heavy co-ordination with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other global central banks, he said. “Canada did a good job through the financial crisis because Mr. Carney worked closely with Mr. Flaherty and Mr. Harper’s government. I think both Mr. Flaherty and Mr. Carney deserve a lot of credit; praising Mr. Carney should not detract from the excellent job Mr. Flaherty also did,” he said. Former TD Bank economic Don Drummond said Mr. Carney was first out of the gate with monetary policy to shore up Canada’s economy, including bringing down the interest rate. The Harper government stepped up later to use fiscal policy for further stimulus. “It’s kind of hard to get worked up about, you know, somebody did a better job than somebody else. Monetary and fiscal policy worked quite well together,” said Mr. Drummond, who is now the Stauffer-Dunning fellow at Queen’s University. Mostafa Askari, chief economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy, said Mr. Carney was responsible for introducing the necessary measures to stabilize financial markets, ensuring they wouldn’t collapse, and noted his role in supporting the creation of the Financial Stability Board in 2009, an initiative of the G20 to prevent another financial crisis. “I am surprised that Mr. Harper said that,” he told The Globe. When in 2012, Mr. Carney appeared alongside Mr. Flaherty at a joint news conference announcing his impending move to England, the men praised each other for their respective roles. Of Mr. Flaherty, Mr. Carney said: “His leadership has ensured a timely, co-ordinated response to the crisis, the right measures to promote Canada’s G7 leading recovery, and the tough decisions necessary to keep the Canadian economy on the path to sustainable growth.” And of Mr. Carney, Mr. Flaherty cited his work on monetary policy and grappling with inflation as accomplishments, adding: “Canada has shone, relatively speaking, in the world during the period of time in which [Mr.] Carney has served as governor of the Bank of Canada.” During that same news conference, Mr. Carney was also asked whether he had to give the Bank of England any commitments that he wouldn’t leave the job to seek leadership of the Liberal Party – something he was rumoured to be interested in at the time. He laughed those off. The Conservative Party has turned its partisan guns on Mr. Carney in recent weeks as it appears he is set to win the leadership and with polls showing a narrowing of the gap between the governing Liberals and Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives. The party is running a major ad campaign seeking to link Mr. Carney to Mr. Trudeau’s policies, using ads on radio, TV and online. Mr. Poilievre and his MPs have gone after Mr. Carney for saying that he was no longer chair of a major investment company when the formal decision was made to move its headquarters to the United States, despite records showing the relocation was completed during his tenure. Mr. Carney told The Globe Friday evening that he should have been more precise when he made those comments about his tenure at Brookfield Asset Management. The Conservatives have also attacked Mr. Carney for being vague about when he would proactively disclose any potential financial conflicts of interest. He has said he will follow all ethics and conflict of interest rules if he becomes prime minister. This would not require him to immediately disclose his financial interests. Mr. Harper said Mr. Carney is the wrong man to run the country because he has served as a key economic adviser to Mr. Trudeau. “We face these threats at a time when Canada should be the wealthiest and most self-reliant economy in the world. We have the resources, the talent and the opportunity to lead. Yet under the Liberals, we have fallen way behind,” Mr. Harper said. Mr. Harper said Mr. Carney served as the principal economic adviser when the Liberal government blocked pipelines, pushed the consumer carbon levy, hiked immigration numbers and oversaw a massive increase in the federal deficit. The deficit for the 2023-24 fiscal year was almost $62-billion. “Carney has advocated for every one of these bad ideas,” Mr. Harper wrote. “So, the choice is indeed about experience – Mark Carney’s experience in being wrong on all the big issues – versus Pierre Poilievre’s experience in being right on those same things.” Mr. Carney began informally advising the Trudeau Liberals in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and last fall was formally appointed by Mr. Trudeau to helm an economic task force, a move that came after reports Mr. Trudeau had been courting Mr. Carney to join his government. Since he declared his run for the Liberal leadership, Mr. Carney has promised to rescind carbon pricing for consumers, build more pipelines, tear down interprovincial trade barriers, cap immigration and balance the operating budget within three years.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Fife, Robert; Levitz, Stephanie",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 4, 2025",Canada-US relations; Fund raising; Monetary policy; Economic crisis; Political leadership; Political parties; Press conferences; Fiscal policy; Conflicts of interest; Central banks; International finance; Prime ministers; Immigration,Nom: Bank of England; NAICS: 521110; Nom: Bank of Canada; NAICS: 521110; Nom: Liberal Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-03-04,The Globe and Mail
Stephen Harper says Carney is taking credit for 'things he had little or nothing to do with',2025.0,"OTTAWA - Liberal leadership frontrunner Mark Carney is trying ""to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with,"" wrote former prime minister Stephen Harper, in a letter to Conservative party members on Sunday. In particular, Harper said he has been listening with ""disbelief"" as Carney describes his role in Canada's response to the 2008 financial crisis. ""Carney's experience is NOT the day-to-day management of Canada's economy during the global financial crisis,"" wrote Harper. ""I have listened, with increasing disbelief, to Mark Carney's attempts to take credit for things he had little or nothing to do with back then. He has been doing this at the expense of the late Jim Flaherty, among the greatest Finance Ministers in Canada's history, who sadly is not here to defend his record. But let me be very clear: the hard calls during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis were made by Jim,"" he wrote. Carney has spoken repeatedly about his experience as Bank of Canada governor on the campaign and has described his rule during the financial crisis in lofty terms. ""As Governor of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis, Mark guided Canada through one of the most turbulent economic periods in modern history,"" reads Carney's LinkedIn bio, crediting him with ""protecting jobs and helping ensure that Canada came out stronger."" Conservatives spent the last week attacking Carney for being ""sneaky,"" inflating his resume and having ""sold out Canada"" by overseeing the move of Canadian investment house Brookfield's head office to the United States. On Friday, National Post reported that Carney had not yet resigned from his multiple international board positions, despite claiming that he had stepped down from all his roles to be ""all in"" on his bid to become prime minister. On Monday, Carney's team said the attack from Harper was a sign that the Conservatives are worried about tightening polls before an expected spring election. ""In 2025, Mr. Harper is being called on to save Pierre Poilievre from a historic drop in support, but no amount of revisionist history can take away from Mr. Carney's proven record of economic leadership,"" a statement from Carney's campaign reads. ""Stephen Harper could have approached Pierre Poilievre about serving as his Finance Minister. He approached Mr. Carney instead."" Liberal members have begun voting on a new leader to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the winner of the leadership race will be announced on March 9.

Politics Insider: Trump says 25-per-cent tariffs going ahead as planned as of midnight:   Harper tells Conservative Party faithful that Carney would not be the right leader to take on Trump,2025.0,"Hello, welcome to Politics Insider. Let’s look at what happened today. U.S. President Donald Trump says his government will impose 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods starting midnight Tuesday, noting there is no room left for either country to make a deal to avoid the punishing levies. Speaking to reporters at the White House Monday, Trump confirmed the tariffs will go ahead as planned, adding the countries will need to build cars and other items in the United States to escape the duties. Meanwhile, ahead of an expected federal election this spring, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper is accusing Liberal leadership frontrunner Mark Carney of falsely taking credit for managing the 2008 financial crisis. Harper also linked him to increases in the federal deficit and the Trudeau government’s failure to build energy projects. In a hard-hitting fundraising letter issued today to Conservative Party faithful, Harper said the former central banker is not the right leader to handle U.S. President Donald Trump and his punitive tariffs. Also today, Canada is getting a new ambassador to Ireland: former Prince Edward Island premier Dennis King. The PMO announced the appointment today. King abruptly resigned as premier and Progressive Conservative leader last month, saying the decision was in the best interests of his family, the government and PEI residents.

"The woman who 'outsmarted' Pierre Poilievre:   Few colleagues endorse her, but Karina Gould believes she can win without being 'Conservative lite'",2025.0,"Talk of who would be Justin Trudeau's successor was happening in Ottawa well before he walked out of Rideau Cottage in early January and told the nation he was bowing out. There were short lists and long lists, cabinet ministers who were quietly organizing and many who were expected to be serious leadership contenders, but Karina Gould's was not a name that often came up in those conversations. But however official Ottawa may have felt, when Gould decided she wanted to be the next Liberal leader, her family was not surprised. ""She was class president in high school and she did political science in university undergrad, and she got involved in the class leadership races there, and she was a young Liberal volunteer,"" said Aaron Gould, one of her three younger brothers. ""I mean, it's just what she's been destined to do."" At 37, Gould is the youngest contender in the race by almost two decades. If she were to manage an upset when the Liberals pick their next leader on March 9, she would be Canada's youngest prime minister by three years. Gould has two children under seven, has held four cabinet posts and is well liked among her colleagues. There are lots of reasons she could wait - many of her cabinet colleagues looked at the political landscape and decided to do just that - but this self-described ""millennial suburban mom"" said this is exactly the right time for her to take on this challenge. ""There's a reason I'm running now, and there's a reason why I think I can win and why I should win now - because I'm the best person for the job in this moment."" Gould comes to the race with a decade of experience as an MP. She has served in Trudeau's cabinet as minister of democratic institutions, international development, and families and social development, as well as government House leader. She graduated high school in 2005 and volunteered at an orphanage in Mexico where she met her husband. She returned to Canada to study at McGill University before earning a master's degree at the University of Oxford. Her professional experience includes work in Washington, D.C. with the Organization of American States and as a trade and investment consultant with the Mexican trade mission in Canada. But politics has long been her passion, and when she returned to Canada in 2014, she did so with the goal of ensuring Stephen Harper wasn't re-elected. She joined the riding association in her hometown of Burlington. When a mentor in local politics there suggested she put her name on the ballot, she said she was initially shocked. ""They said to me, 'You should really think about running,' and I said, 'I do plenty of exercise,' and they were like, 'No, for office,' "" she said. ""My jaw hit the floor."" Gould did run in 2015 and won the Burlington seat that had been in Conservative hands since 2006. In 2018, she became the youngest woman ever appointed to cabinet at age 29. But her first assignment was a firing line, as she took over the democratic institutions file just as the Liberals broke their promise of electoral reform. ""It was a very tough first test for sure but politics is also about doing hard things,"" she said. ""But it was one in which I also learned a lot and I grew a lot through that as well."" Gould said she would now support a citizens' assembly on democratic reform and would put any ideas from that process to a nationwide referendum, arguing that in retrospect, it was naive to think a parliamentary committee could come up with a solution. With just three formal endorsements from fellow Liberal MPs - Hamilton's Lisa Hepfner, Mental Health Minister Ya'ara Saks and Oakville's Pam Damoff - Gould struggled to make the payments on the leadership race's $350,000 entry fee. Before she launched her campaign, she says she got a lot of encouragement and support from other caucus colleagues who ultimately decided to endorse Mark Carney or Chrystia Freeland. ""I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed,"" she said. ""But at the end of the day, that's their decision and I respect that."" Three other fellow Liberal MPs - Mark Gerretsen, Leah Taylor Roy and Rob Oliphant - who have endorsed other candidates are listed on Elections Canada records as donors to Gould's campaign. Last year, when Trudeau's cabinet gathered in Halifax, Gould made a rally-the-troops-type of speech to her colleagues that she said she was encouraged to share with Liberal staffers as the party's poll numbers and internal morale were falling. ""There wasn't anyone having honest conversations about where we were and I stepped in to fill that void, and to talk about the reality of the situation and then to try to provide a path on how we can dig ourselves out of it,"" she said. Gould is popular among those Liberal staffers, the mostly young men and women who keep cabinet ministers on schedule, write talking points, take meetings and research policy. Hepfner said that was clear at a send-off gathering in Ottawa before Gould went on maternity leave last year. ""I was almost the only other MP there. It was all staffers, and the whole night people were crying, telling stories about how she'd had an impact on her life,"" Hepfner said. ""Everybody who's ever worked for her absolutely worships her, and that just says so much to me about her leadership style."" She is also less willing than her rivals to abandon some of the policies those staffers helped develop and sell over the last nine years. While Carney and Freeland say they would eliminate Trudeau's consumer price on carbon, Gould says she would keep the levy and its associated rebates in place, while freezing any further increases. She also proposes to accelerate the Liberals' plans on gun control, and to expand its electric vehicle incentives and housing programs. Beating Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is what is driving her to compete in this leadership race. To do that, she said the Liberals have to do a better job of listening to Canadians without abandoning their values. ""One of the things that I am hearing from Liberals is that they don't want us to be Conservative lite,"" she said. Gould attended the Halifax cabinet retreat after having spent six months back in Burlington for her second maternity leave. She lived a more suburban life then, with Mommy and Me yoga classes and trips to the grocery store. She said the message she brought back from half a year outside the Ottawa bubble was that Canadians were struggling, something she thinks the Liberals were missing. She believes the government handled COVID-19 better than any other country, but missed what was happening when the pandemic ended. ""I said to my colleagues many times, Winston Churchill won the war and then lost the election, because it's about the future and not about the past,"" she said. Poilievre was listening, Gould said, and that's what helped him pull ahead in public support. ""I don't agree with him, but he is a very smart political strategist and he is doing a good job in the things that he is good at,"" she said. While Carney and Freeland have made major announcements on big picture issues like economic productivity, defence spending and artificial intelligence, Gould's platform is more grounded, focusing on bread and butter economic issues. She has promised an overhaul of social safety net programs like Employment Insurance, putting the country on the path toward a basic income and a variety of programs to build more housing. She has pledged to lower the GST by one per cent for a year and to permanently remove it from children's items like diapers and car seats. Ultimately, what the Liberals want is a leader who can beat Poilievre. While polls suggest the challenger most able to do that is Carney, Gould argues she has already defeated him as House leader, ensuring that the government survived a number of confidence votes. ""I outsmarted him for the last six months in the House of Commons. I made sure that the government continued, that we got big things done, that he wasn't able to bring a government down.""

"Bell: Angry Canadians lose their minds, Liberals paint Poilievre as Trump",2025.0,"The Liberal ad tells you all you need to know. And it's working. Incredible as it may seem, the script is working on enough people to be downright disturbing. The ad puts video clips of U.S. President Donald Trump next to clips of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Both men say everything is broken. Both men talk about left-wing woke censorship. Both men speak of the radical left and standing up for the Canadian truckers and the rise in crime. The Liberal pitch then asks the question. It is the question they hope pissed-off Canadians will ask themselves when they go to vote in an election likely be to be held sooner rather than later. How can you speak for Canada when you sound like Donald Trump? The fact Poilievre has been on target pointing out the many ways the Liberals have screwed Canada naturally does not fit into the Liberal equation. For their purposes, Poilievre is a Trump and Trump is poison for enough Canadians to win an election Even when Trump himself says Poilievre is not a Trump guy, it doesn't matter. Truth is the first casualty in a political war. Meanwhile, more polls emerge. It was not so long ago when those many polls said Poilievre was wiping the floor with the Liberals. The party of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was heading straight down the political toilet. Even when Trudeau said he was leaving the Liberal party was still in deep trouble. Then came Trump and his threats of tariffs on Canadian goods heading to the U.S. and the non-stop mentions of his desire Canada become the 51st state. Then came the banker Mark Carney cast as the latest Liberal saviour. Candidate Mark Carney during the first of the two nights of the federal Liberal leadership debate in Montreal, on Feb. 24, 2025. Then came the Liberals casting themselves as the true defenders of Canada when, in fact, this country is weaker than it was almost a decade ago when they took charge, a country easier for the likes of Trump to threaten. Then the Liberals started supporting what they now oppose, like more pipelines to sell more Canadian oil to places outside of the U.S. They who weakened the military said they wanted a strong military. Those who were soft on crime said they were tough on crime. Those who didn't give a damn about strong borders back strong borders. Some of their supporters who thought outward displays of patriotism was all too American now went around calling people traitors and comparing them to Nazi collaborators if they didn't say they were voting Liberal. A lot of Canadians didn't seem to notice this was a political U-turn smacking of the worst political cynicism. Their anger toward Trump has trumped everything and pulls the Liberal bandwagon. Then, this week pollster Eric Grenier tells us the numbers show the Carney-led Liberals could beat the Conservative Poilievre. Plugging in poll numbers from more than one polling outfit to project how many House of Commons seats each party would win in an election now and the seat count for the top two parties is jaw-dropping. The Conservatives 146 seats. The Liberals with Carney leading the charge ... gulp ... 169 seats. That's three seats short of a majority government. The odds of the Liberals getting more seats than the Conservatives is now at ... gulp ... 72 per cent. The Conservative landslide has evaporated before our very eyes. To many of us who follow the bouncing ball of Canadian politics this is all so bizarre, surreal, unbelievable. How do the Liberals who have far, far more crap than gold on their record even have a chance to be government again let alone be leading in the polls? As Marc Henry, noted ThinkHQ pollster puts it: ""It is all because of one person whose name starts with T and it isn't Trudeau."" Trump. ""I think a lot of Canadians just look at Trump and feel he is an absolutely disgusting human being."" They want to go after Trump. They want to make Trump suffer. Forget about fear, this is loathing. The Liberals are not stupid. They know their record sucks. They know Carney is no messiah. But they know enough Canadians just want someone to tell them they will punch back on Trump. All the other issues, all the problems in this country, the mess the Liberals have left, the Liberal promise of sunny ways turning into stormy days, it has all taken a back seat in the minds of enough Canadians to clear a path for a possible Liberal comeback that's more like a rising from the dead. Some, especially in conservative Alberta, insist a Liberal win can't possibly be true. ""If their view is the polls are wrong, they're not,"" says Henry. ""It's real. Whether that holds up through an election campaign, I don't know. That's what campaigns are for. ""But as it sits today it absolutely is real, as real as the Earth going around the Sun."" rbell@postmedia.com",Calgary Herald (Online); Calgary,Calgary,"Bell, Rick",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 1, 2025",Conservatism; Political campaigns; Canadians; Politics; Political advertising,,2025-03-01,Calgary Herald
Letters: Can we trust Poilievre to lead Canada through this crisis?,2025.0,"When I moved to Canada in 1978, I was proud to live in John Diefenbaker's Prince Albert riding in Saskatchewan. A spell-binding orator, Dief the Chief, was a human rights champion, a defence lawyer who became a Progressive Conservative prime minister. These days the best the Conservatives can offer is Pierre Poilievre, a career politician who talks in slogans. Like Trump, he wants to drill baby drill, reduce taxes on the rich and slash foreign aid. In 20 years, he voted against the environment 400 times. Last year, he said Canada felt broken. This year's slogan is ""Canada First."" Can we trust him to lead Canada through the most serious crisis in our history? As a member of SCAN (Seniors for Climate Action Now) I want a trustworthy leader, someone who stands up to Trump and has the skills to grow an environmentally responsible economy and control inflation. Poilievre is an embarrassment. Joselyn Proby, Edmonton Canada can do more to counter Gaza threat It should be welcomed that several ministers of the Trudeau government have publicly countered Trump's outrageous threats to annex the coastal enclave and to ethnically cleanse the Gazans. (President Trump has no right to annex Palestine as he has no right to annex Canada). We demand that Canada do more: 1) Immediately recognize the Palestinian state, as 124 members of the United Nations have done; 2) impose a robust arms embargo on Canada's two-way arms trade with Israel; 3) expedite the family reunification program for Gazans with family in Canada; 4) use its influence with the state of Israel to restore the provision of aid to Gazans through UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency); 5) prohibit Canadians from serving in the Israeli Defence Force and investigate Canadians in the defence force for war crimes; 6) remove the charitable status of all organizations in Canada who raise funds (tax-free) for entities in Israel which support the Israeli Defence Force and the Israeli colonial project in Palestine; 7) play a role in ensuring that the rebuilding of Gaza goes ahead with the Palestinians in place. The U.S., although arming the Israeli assault in Gaza, were wrongfully allowed to manage the peace process.

"Machiavelli, Poilievre and the Liberal leadership race",2025.0,"A commentary by a professor emeritus in the University of Victoria School of Earth and Ocean Sciences. He is the author of The Carbon Tax Question: Clarifying Canada's Most Consequential Policy Debate. There is no doubt Trumpian tariffs pose an existential crisis for Canada, but let's not be distracted. On intergenerational timescales, Trump's actions - which represent ""the dumbest trade war in history"" according to the Wall Street Journal -are ephemeral. The real existential crisis is not what Trump does in the short term - it's the globally accelerating carbon emissions that are driving us toward the edge of an exceptionally dangerous and exceptionally expensive climatic abyss. If you don't believe that, just ask the residents of Jasper, Fort McMurray, Los Angeles or Vanuatu. In that light, it is particularly puzzling that candidates seeking to lead Canada's Natural Governing Party, also known as the Liberals, are preparing to weaken or abandon what is one of the best carbonemissions-limiting schemes on the planet: our federal carbon tax. Why that abandonment? Let's quickly review. Justin Trudeau brought to life our revenueneutral Consumer Fuel Charge and Output-Based Pricing System in 2018, collectively known as Canada's carbon tax. It was loosely based on B.C.'s internationally acclaimed, gently accelerating tax, fully in place in the province from 2008 to 2013. B.C.'s tax template centred on revenue neutrality: collect the tax, but give it back. We did that, every penny, by lowering personal, small-business, and corporate income tax rates and providing direct cash supports for low-income citizens. And if you burnt less carbon, thereby lowering your tax hit, you still benefited from the lower tax on your earnings. That simple tax shift - onto pollution and off earnings - encouraged smart choices and it worked. B.C.'s emissions fell significantly and our economy grew without missing a step. A decade later, Trudeau did something similar: rebate carbon tax revenue to all individual Canadian taxpayers (excepting B.C., Quebec, Yukon and Nunavut that run their own programs), and if you were a large emitter, give the tax revenue back to the jurisdiction of origin for distribution as it saw fit, for example, to subsidize installation of lowemission technologies. Now we are in the midst of a Liberal leadership contest that follows directly on the heels of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's Machiavellian campaign to ""axe the tax."" Multiple psychology textbooks define Machiavellianism as centred on having an inherent ability to manipulate, to be cunning and to use whatever means necessary to gain power. Poilievre's campaign fit. It was manipulative, a classic example of lying by omission (did anyone ever hear Poilievre use the phrase ""revenue neutral""?); it was cunning - incessant repetition of ""axe the tax,"" a hackneyed rhyme that registered cleanly in the minds of the public; and it aligned with the ""whatever means necessary"" criterion by rhetorically linking the tax to the coincident but entirely unconnected postCOVID global inflation. Polling showed that Poilievre's successful campaign, albeit reeking of snake oil, convinced legions of Canadians coast-to-coast that their lives and pocketbooks had been measurably harmed by ""Justin Trudeau's job-killing carbon tax."" It's that success that sent leading Liberal leadership candidates Mark Carney, Chrystia Freeland and Frank Baylis scurrying to walk beside Poilievre in the axe-the-tax parade, claiming in the debates this week that the consumer fuel charge had become ""too divisive"" to continue as our flagship climateaction policy. To her credit, only Karina Gould had the moxie during the debates to stand against abolishing the consumer carbon tax. She, alone, appears to understand what is truly at stake on the intergenerational scale. And so, our political leadership class at the centre or on the centre-left of our federal political spectrum has largely bowed to a Machiavellian challenge. It's shameful to see most of that cohort wave a white flag. What Canada needs now is not surrender but Machiavellian reverse engineering. Beat Poilievre at his own game. Use whatever means are necessary to promote to the hilt the value of revenue-neutrality, rebates, and low-income cash supports, funded by the carbon tax. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Remind Canadians, repeatedly - and honestly - that they get the money back; most don't seem to know. Be cunning: lead with ""I'm going to cut your income taxes and put money in your pocket"" instead calling on us to address the climate challenge as a moral imperative, as important as that is. These are marketing basics. Use them. Great leaders grant themselves the space to reconsider unwise positions. Carney et al: it's not too late to do just that. Grant yourselves that space. Think twice. Stand taller. Take a step back from the eroding edge of the climatic abyss, and focus on the real existential threat by taxing carbon emissions, not income, just like B.C. successfully did in years past. Above all, don't let cheap three-word axe slogans or this hour's tariff musings from south of the border deflect you from doing what's right.","Times - Colonist; Victoria, B.C.","Victoria, B.C.","Pedersen, Thomas F",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 1, 2025",Leadership; Tax rates; Tax revenues; Carbon; Low income groups; Neutrality; Environmental tax,,2025-03-01,Times - Colonist
Trump slams Poilievre as 'not a MAGA guy'; U.K. Interview,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's big - gest problem is that he's ""not a MAGA guy,"" according to U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump told British news magazine The Spectator that he wasn't pleased with Poilievre's recent jabs in a wide-ranging interview published on Friday. ""I don't like what he's saying about me. It's just not positive about me,"" Trump said to interviewer Ben Domenech. Trump warned that Poilievre was making a ""big mistake"" by ratcheting up the tough talk and was likely to join a long list of leaders who've tried and failed to outmuscle him. ""They think they're going to be the tough guy and they're going to knock out Trump, and they end up getting the hell beat out of 'em,"" said Trump. ""They all make that mistake."" Poilievre has had to walk a fine line on Trump with polls showing the Republican president is popular with a segment of the Conservative base. The Conservative leader didn't immediately respond to Trump's comments, but Conservative MP Michael Barrett was quick to shrug them off. ""We're laser focused on what's best for Canadians, we're not worried about comments of people in other countries,"" Barrett told reporters at a media scrum in Ottawa on Friday. Poilievre has shifted to a more combative tone as part of a ""Canada First"" rebrand, partly in response to Trump's tariff and annexation threats, which have spurred a rebound in the governing Liberals' polling numbers. Poilievre unleashed his strongest words yet against Trump at a recent rally in Ottawa, warning him not to confuse Canada's ""kindness for weakness."" ""Let me be clear: we will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country."" He still has a ways to go to sell Canadians on his steely new persona, with polls indicating they'd prefer likely Liberal leadership race winner Mark Carney to manage bilateral relations with Trump.

"The Conservatives have had the rug pulled out from under them:   Like a dog chasing a bus who suddenly finds it idling at a stoplight, Leader Pierre Poilievre and his party have gotten what they wanted – so now what?",2025.0,"The Conservatives must be feeling personally attacked by the universe right now. Just two months ago, national polls had them leading the Liberals by at least 20 points, and they had been luxuriating in fat margins for a year and a half. Then, after Justin Trudeau announced he would resign in early January and Donald Trump started musing about eating Canada for lunch, the red and blue lines on the graph started to converge. By this week, the average gap between the parties was down to single digits as Canadians contemplated who could best defend this country from the marauding tangerine emperor. And as the Liberal leadership debates sucked up all the political oxygen, major polls had the party ahead for the first time in two years. There’s certain to be a temporary sugar high feeding some of that, given the novelty around Mark Carney as the likely next Liberal leader. Still, an election that looked to be the Conservatives’ for the plucking may now be a real fight. But the bigger problem for them is how the landscape has shifted dramatically in a way that cuts off almost everything that’s been so effective for them over the past two years. ""Canada is broken"" articulated the sense of many Canadians that things had gone off the rails, some essential social bargain had been broken and the people with power didn’t care. But good luck making that argument in a moment of anxious patriotism when people are squinting at their groceries looking for a maple leaf and booing The Star Spangled Banner at hockey games. Pierre Poilievre has also spent the past two years energetically making the case that each one of Canada’s big, deep problems was caused entirely by the Prime Minister. But now, Mr. Trudeau is as good as gone and someone has loosened the neck on the overinflated public-rage balloon shaped like his head. Same with ""Axe the tax."" That was both a specific, central policy promise for the Tories and a battle cry about affordability woes worsened by a maliciously out-of-touch government. Now, the Liberals’ terrible job of selling the policy and the Conservatives’ excellent job of making it politically radioactive means the carbon tax is as good as dead; Mr. Carney has vowed to jettison it once in power. Like a dog chasing a bus who suddenly finds it idling at a stoplight, Mr. Poilievre and his party have gotten what they wanted – so now what? You could see them struggling with this in real time this week – stuck in a gear that no longer made sense, but unable to find another way to move forward. Conservative MPs held four separate press conferences, trying to seize some attention, frame the Liberal debates and most of all, find a way to define and defile Mr. Carney already. The press conference on Monday before the first debate revolved around accusations about the Liberals staging a fake contest that was really a coronation and that Mr. Carney represents an uninterrupted continuation of Mr. Trudeau’s disastrous policies because he was an economic adviser to the Prime Minister. On Tuesday, the thrust was that Mr. Carney is concealing plans for a ""shadow carbon tax"" in his support for industrial carbon pricing and that his budget plans are nothing more than a ""sneaky accounting trick,"" according to MP Michael Barrett. Then at midweek, the Tories focused on how Mr. Carney had claimed in a scrum after the English debate that Brookfield, the asset management company he chaired until entering the leadership contest, decided to move its headquarters to New York only after he left. The Conservatives had documentation they said showed that he was being dishonest, and they wanted to make sure the media and Canadian voters got a look at it. The party also put out a new ad this week framing Mr. Carney as a sellout. Over a threatening drumbeat and red-and-black images that look like a slasher film, a narrator says that Donald Trump takes advantage of weakness and ""nobody is weaker than Mark Carney,"" given the Brookfield relocation. Toward the end of the ad, a disembodied voice says ""Sneaky"" as text stamps the word onscreen. The voice is Jon Stewart’s, and he said it during a Daily Show interview in which the gag was that he was so dazzled by Mr. Carney that he was trying to persuade him to run for leader. It was more come-on than stinging critique. This whole week had the feel of the Conservatives testing a grab-bag of ideas to see what would get traction, and a corresponding frustration that none of it quite did. It seems noteworthy that Mr. Poilievre – normally his party’s most visible and enthusiastic prosecutor – was nowhere to be seen, leaving a handful of his MPs to make the case instead. The Conservatives have dominated the past two years in Canadian politics in part because of their relentless message discipline, hammering on tightly focused arguments that both responded to and sculpted the public mood. But now, that same ability seems to have left them frozen in place, looking down perplexed at a bare floor where a rug has just been pulled out from under them. Painting Mr. Carney as nothing more than Mr. Trudeau in a banker’s suit makes sense in terms of reminding Canadians of what they were absolutely fed up with just two months ago – but it’s still about Mr. Trudeau. And continuing to warn about a hidden carbon-pricing agenda after you succeeded in getting the Liberals to shiv their signature climate policy is almost touching. The problem, for the Conservatives, is that these arguments revolve around a political matchup that no longer exists, and they belong to a fundamentally different mental landscape. Somewhere in the world, there must be a language that has a word for the wistfulness you feel for the enemy you wish you were still fighting.

"Poilievre isn't MAGA enough for Trump:   And don't get him started on Freeland, whom he got 'fired'",2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump wants at least two of Justin Trudeau's would-be successors - Liberal or Conservative - to know one thing: he doesn't much like either of them. In an interview published Friday with the Spectator magazine, Trump took credit for what he called Chrystia Freeland's ""firing"" by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and said Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's ""biggest problem"" is that he is not Trump's kind of conservative. ""I think his biggest problem is he's not a MAGA guy, you know? I mean, he's really not he's not a Trump guy at all,"" Trump told Ben Domenech, the magazine's editor-at-large and a Fox News contributor, in an interview recorded Thursday at the White House. Poilievre responded to Trump's comments in a post on X without tagging the president directly, and linked to a video rejecting Trump's annexation threats: ""Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA. I am for Canada First. Always. Canada has always been America's best friend & ally. But we will NEVER be the 51st state."" Trump's view of Freeland is by now well-known. In 2018, amid the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement during Trump's first term as president, he said he didn't like ""the negotiating style of Canada. We don't like their representative very much."" In the wide-ranging and friendly interview, Domenech suggested to Trump that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has clearly decided to get along with the U.S. president unlike ""some of these other left-of-centre politicians,"" naming Freeland. The interviewer noted Freeland's statement during this week's leadership debate to replace Trudeau that she would strengthen alliances with European countries, particularly nuclear powers, to protect Canada's Arctic, as well as South Korea, Japan, as she presented herself as someone who can take on Trump as he continues to threaten Canada with punishing tariffs. Domenech also said Freeland wants ""a nuclear alliance with other European nations, and Japan, against the United States, because you're predatory,"" according to a transcript published on magazine's website. ""She's terrible,"" Trump replied. ""I know her very well. She's absolutely terrible for the country. She's incompetent in many respects and can only cause ill will for Canada. In fact, Governor Trudeau understood that. I call him 'governor.' Governor Trudeau understood that. And he actually fired her because of a meeting he had with me. I said, 'She is so bad. She's bad for the country.' You know, if she were talented. I know people that are sort of bad people, but they do a good job running a country."" Freeland, the former deputy prime minister who quit Trudeau's cabinet in December, said in her resignation letter that Trudeau told her he wanted to replace her as finance minister. Trump then asked Domench who he thought would win ""the nomination"" - presumably meaning the contest to become Liberal leader and prime minister - to which the interviewer replied, ""They all seemed pretty nutty to me."" Trump responded, ""She's a whack."" Freeland responded to Trump on X, posting, ""There's a reason Trump called me a 'whack.' There's a reason he complained about my negotiating skills. There's a reason Putin kicked me out of Russia, too. I don't back down - and Trump and Putin know it. I'm ready to fight for Canada - and win."" The Spectator editor-at-large told Trump that Liberals are leaning into some of his comments, and he asked the president if he believes Canada's Conservatives are ""still going to be able to pull it out up there?"" Trump replied, ""Well, I think his biggest problem is he's not a MAGA guy, you know? I mean, he's really not he's not a Trump guy at all.""

FIRST REA DING: Betting markets still roundly predicting a Poilievre win,2025.0,"First Reading is a daily newsletter keeping you posted on the travails of Canadian politicos, all curated by the National Post's own Tristin Hopper. To get an early version sent directly to your inbox, sign up here TOP STORY With multiple Canadian polls now showing a stunning rebound for the Liberal party, there is one electoral indicator that hasn't deviated from predicting a Conservative victory: the betting markets. Since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January his intention to resign, all of Canada's major pollsters have shown the Liberals experiencing a 10- to 20-point rebound. Multiple polls are now showing that if Mark Carney wins the Liberal leadership race, he is the favourite to win the next federal election. A Leger poll this week put a Carney Liberal party at 40 per cent to 38 per cent for the Conservatives. An Angus Reid Institute poll from last week found a Carney-led Liberal party polling at 37 per cent to the Conservatives' 40. But on Polymarket - a website that allows users to bet money on future events - the Conservatives are still widely favoured to win. The equivalent of $13 million has been wagered on a question of who will be prime minister after the next election, and the results show a 66 per cent likelihood that it's Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Carney is in a distant second place at just 35 per cent. And in a decisive last place is NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Singh has attracted more than $5 million in wagers that he will not become prime minister - a sum that is actually several times the current cash reserves of his party. Ontario election recap: Doug Ford says 'the people have spoken' after third majority win Bonnie Crombie loses bid for seat, but vows to stay as Liberal leader And this is consistent across other betting markets. The British gambling firm Ladbrokes has 4/9 odds on the Conservatives winning ""the most seats"" in the next election, against 7/4 for the Liberals. This means that if you bet $10 on a Tory win, you'll receive just $14.44 if you're right. If you bet the same $10 on a Liberal win, you'll get back $27.50 if they pull it off, since the likelihood is lower. ""The bookies are so confident that the Conservatives are going to win the Canadian election this year that they've opened up betting for the party to win the second-highest number of seats, with the Liberal Party odds-on in that market,"" reads a Feb. 17 blog post by Ladbrokes The gambling platform BetMGM is also banking on a Conservative win, with the Liberals in opposition. ""The 45th Canadian federal election betting odds favour the Conservative Party of Canada to win the most seats,"" reads a Feb. 19 statement by BetMGM There, a $10 bet on a Poilievre victory will yield only $12.50 if it turns out to be correct. Betting $10 on a Liberal win, meanwhile, yields a payout of $37.50 - a near-quadrupling of the original wager. The betting markets don't always get it right, with one of the most conspicuous exceptions being the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Bookmakers heavily favoured Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the race, and lost millions in payouts when Donald Trump claimed victory. The Irish bookmaker Paddy Power, for one, was so confident in a Clinton win that it had already begun paying off Clinton wagers when the Trump win was secured. ""We're in the business of making predictions and decided to put our neck on the line by paying out early on Hillary Clinton, but boy did we get it wrong,"" a spokesman said at the time. But in the most recent U.S. presidential election, betting markets did turn out to be a much more reliable predictor than conventional polls. On the eve of Election Day, aggregate U.S. polls showed a clean tie between Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Betting markets, however, were all relatively confident in a Trump win, with Polymarket assigning a 60 per cent likelihood to a Trump win with two weeks to go until Election Day. In the end, the prediction markets had it: Trump won 312 of 538 Electoral College votes, and 49.8 per cent of the popular vote as compared to 48.3 per cent for Harris. ""A prediction market was more accurate in forecasting the 2024 presidential election than traditional polls and pundits,"" reads an analysis published by the University of Cincinnati. Betting markets also yielded an accurate forecast of Canada's 2021 federal election. At the time, opinion polls showed a relatively clean tie between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with both parties hovering at about 32 per cent support. But platforms such as Polymarket and PredictIt accurately predicted not only a Liberal win, but that they would win a minority government. IN OTHER NEWS In Tuesday night's debate Chrystia Freeland seemed to say that she would invite the U.K. and France to protect Canada from the United States using nuclear weapons. Freeland said she would urgently strike an alliance with both countries ""that guarantees our security in a time when United States can be a threat"" - and specifically cited the fact that the U.K. and France possess nuclear weapons. As an aside, if Ottawa wanted a non-U.S. nuclear deterrent, it wouldn't need to ask for British or French help; Canada has all the necessary wherewithal and knowledge to build a bomb, it would just take a while. The Conservatives have wheeled out a pretty big chunk of oppo research against Liberal leadership contender Mark Carney, alleging that he only just finished moving his financial company, Brookfield Asset Management, from Canada to New York City - allegedly to shield it from the effects of any Trump tariffs. The ""smoking gun"" of the claim is a Dec. 1 letter to shareholders in which Carney urged them to approve the move in order to ""gain access to the deepest pools of capital."" This would be wholly uncontroversial if Carney was still just a private citizen running a financial company, but it occurs in the context of Carney making campaign promises to fortify the Canadian economy against U.S. threats. So it's somewhat awkward that he just finished moving a multi-billion dollar company from Canada to the United States - and at a time when Trump was already making signals of declaring trade war against Canada. And the shareholder letter would seem to pour cold water on Carney's Tuesday night claim that the relocation had nothing to do with him. ""The formal decision of the board happened after I ceased to be on the board,"" Carney told reporters after the second Liberal leadership debate. ""I do not have a connection with Brookfield Asset Management."" There's a non-zero chance that Wayne Gretzky has unilaterally patched up the threat of a ruinous U.S./Canadian trade war. After weeks of U.S. president Donald Trump issuing a steady stream of insults and annexation threats against Canada, he issued a bizarre Wednesday night social media post that seemed to be a conciliation of sorts. Following an apparent conversation with the hockey great, Trump called Gretzky ""the Greatest Canadian of them all,"" adding ""he supports Canada the way it is, as he should, even though it's not nearly as good as it could be as part of the Greatest and Most Powerful Country in the World, the Good Ole' U.S.A.!""

Ontario election 2025: PC George Darouze wins Carleton riding,2025.0,"Long-time Ottawa city councillor George Darouze won Carleton riding Thursday, returning the rural and suburban riding to Progressive Conservative blue. Darouze called the win humbling. ""It has been a long campaign, very hard tackling Mother Nature and the weather, but I feel great and humble that Carleton chose me to be its representative at Queen's Park."" He said his decade of experience on city council has helped prepare him for the role. ""Experience matters. I understand how policies and everything functions."" Darouze also said he could play a role representing Ottawa at Queen's Park to help the city. Darouze replaces MPP Goldie Ghamari, who was booted from the PC caucus last summer and served the final months of her term representing the riding at Queens's Park as an independent MPP. She did not seek re-election. Darouze said people in the riding were ready for an election after Ghamari became an independent. Having a representative in the governing party, he said, makes a difference when it comes to getting residents' concerns heard. As of 11 p.m. Thursday, it appeared Darouze might be the only PC candidate elected in an Ottawa riding. Brandon Bay, the Liberal candidate, held his campaign party at Gabriel Pizza on Limebank Road, where the room buzzed with positivity for much of the night. Despite coming second, Bay didn't lose his smile, pointing out that the Liberals had seen a 12 per cent increase in votes in his riding, a Conservative stronghold for more than a century. ""We were always the underdog. I'm feeling really proud of the work we did. We got over 20,000 votes - it would've been a win in a lot of other ridings. We've connected with a lot of young families and it's momentum we can hope to continue building on."" Carleton riding surrounds Ottawa in the south. It runs from the growing community of Stittsville in the west, to the Rideau River, then east of the river along the city's southern boundary to Ramsayville Road. The riding is relatively new. It was recreated from parts of Nepean-Carleton, Carleton-Mississippi Mills and Ottawa South in 2018. Since then, and even in previous iterations, it has always voted Conservative. Federal Conservative party Leader Pierre Poilievre holds the riding at the national level. In 2018, the first year of the recreated riding, then-Progressive Conservative Ghamari was elected, then won again in 2022 with more than 48 per cent of the vote. Ghamari was removed from the PC caucus last summer after meeting with British far-right activist and anti-Muslim crusader Tommy Robinson and posting about it on social media. At the time, Ghamari said she was not aware of his history. PC Leader Doug Ford mentioned serious lapses of judgment and a failure to collaborate with caucus leadership in the decision to boot her from caucus, after which she sat as an independent MPP. Three days into the early election campaign, Ghamari said she would not seek re-election, saying she had achieved everything she hoped to accomplish as MPP for Carleton over the last few years. ""It is now time for me to close this chapter of my political life and begin a new one,"" she said, adding, ""Please rest assured that this is not a 'goodbye.' "" That left Carleton without an incumbent in the race. In addition to long-time Ottawa city councillor Darouze, and Liberal candidate Bay - who previously ran for mayor of Ottawa - five candidates competed to be MPP in the riding: Sherin Faili, who has worked in the field of human resources, policy and planning and lives in Stittsville, for the NDP; Mystic Plaunt for the Greens; Rob Stocki, a former sergeant with the Ottawa police who was involved in the trucker convoy, for the New Blue party; Bruce Anthony Faulkner for the Libertarian party; and Brian Hull as an independent. - With files from Daniel Fraser. epayne@postmedia.com Our website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark our homepage and sign up for our newsletters so we can keep you informed.

Ontario PC Party retain their stronghold in Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke,2025.0,"Conservative Billy Denault cruised to an easy victory in the rural riding of Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, leading the second place candidate, Liberal Oliver Jacob, by more than 14,000 votes with 95 per cent of the polls reported. Denault had received more than 55 per cent of all votes cast in the longtime Tory stronghold. Marshall Buchanan of the New Democratic Party placed third. Voter turnout topped 48 per cent in the riding of nearly 90,000 voters. Voters in the huge northeaster Ontario riding were guaranteed to have a new representative at Queen's Park. John Yakabuski had held the riding for the provincial Conservatives since 2003, but announced in November that he was not running for re-election. Not that that meant the race was wide open. The one-time Liberal bastion has voted Conservative since the turn of the Millennium. Denault, a lifelong Ottawa Valley resident and municipal councillor in Arnprior, was named the Conservative candidate in January. Community leader, municipal professional and former councillor Oliver Jacob returned as the Liberal party candidate after finishing third in the riding in 2022 with 3,928 votes. From 2018 to 2022, Jacob served as one of the youngest municipal councillors in the history of the Township of McNab/Braeside. Marshall Buchanan ran for the NDP and Anna Dolan for the Green party. Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke is one of the largest ridings in all of Canada. It sprawls northwest of the National Capital Region with the Ottawa River as its northeastern boundary from Arnprior north to Deep River. The western boundary extends to Algonquin Provincial Park. The region is defined by its dense wilderness and tracts of farmland dotted with small historic towns, with well-traversed cottage country along the many lakes and rivers and the picturesque Madawaska and Bonnechere valleys. The largest community is Pembroke, a former logging centre settled nearly 200 years ago and whose population has remained stable for decades at around 14,000 residents.

Ontario Election 2025: PC Stéphane Sarrazin repeats in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell,2025.0,"Stéphane Sarrazin is headed back to Queen's Park for a second term. Voters in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell opted to send the Progressive Conservative back to Toronto to represent the riding with Premier Doug Ford's majority government after the polls closed in the Ontario election on Thursday night. It was no surprise that Sarrazin kept his seat as the blue wave swept across Ontario. He captured more than 51 per cent of the vote and finished with a winning margin of 6,766 votes. ""We need a strong mandate and leadership to project our jobs,"" Sarrazin said in a post on the social media site X. There were seven candidates in the riding. The biggest challenge came from Trevor Stewart, who represented the Liberal party. He had just over 37 per cent of the vote. Stewart, 25, earned a bachelor's degree in Conflict Studies and Human Rights at uOttawa and has worked on Parliament Hill as an assistant to Liberal MP Francis Drouin for the last four years. ""I am grateful to the residents of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who put their faith in me and voted for me. I have been overwhelmed by all the messages of support that I have received from my neighbours and people from across this riding,"" said Stewart, who congratulated Sarrazin on his victory. ""I will continue to fight for our vision of a better Ontario, for more family doctors, for a better education system and for more housing. There is too much on the line to give up. Hope is always possible and when the light shines and the sun rises, look to the East."" In 2022, at just 23, he was elected to Clarence-Rockland's city council, where he represents the villages of Hammond and Cheney. Up until 2018, Glengarry-Prescott-Russell was a safe Liberal seat. That year, it flipped to Amanda Simard, who ran as a Progressive Conservative, but she left the caucus and sat as an independent in 2020 after disagreements over some of the French language policies in the party. Simard ran as a Liberal candidate in the last election and lost by a slim margin to Sarrazin. He finished with only 1,132 more votes than Simard to win the riding. Sarrazin told the Vision website based in Rockland that the economy and proposed tariffs on Canadian productions by U.S. President Donald Trump were part of the concerns of people in his riding. He told the website in a question/answer before the election that a Doug Ford government would be best equipped to deal with Trump. ""The Ontario government is placing greater emphasis than ever on infrastructure, with announcements of good school projects and multimillion-dollar investments in several communities in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell,"" Sarrazin said in a Google-translated version. ""Additionally, we are taking concrete actions to minimize the impact of Trump's tariffs and support our economic sector."" Sarrazin, a former mayor of Alfred and Plantagenet and warden of Prescott and Russell United Counties, represents a large riding that's located largely east of Ottawa. The Ottawa River is the northern border while it stops at the border to Quebec in the east. The riding consists of the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, and the part of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry comprised of the Township of North Glengarry. It also includes parts of Ottawa east of Orléans. Clarence-Rockland, Russell, Cumberland, Navan, Embrun, Casselman and Hawkesbury are in the riding. Sarrazin has served as a parliamentary assistant to the minister of small business and the minister of francophone affairs since March 2024. He is a former small business owner. In the last campaign, he pushed for the widening of Highway 174. Stewart was advocating giving residents of Glengarry-Prescott-Russell more access to family doctors. ""Leaked data from the Ministry of Health in Ontario painted a rough picture. Approximately one in three people in Glengarry-Prescott-Russell either don't have access to a family doctor or are imminently at risk of losing their family doctor,"" Stewart told Postmedia. ""We need to take our health seriously, not waste billions on venture projects in Toronto.""

Politics Insider: Trump takes shots at Freeland and Poilievre:   U.S. President even takes credit for Freeland’s resignation from cabinet,2025.0,"Hello, welcome to Politics Insider. Let’s look at what happened today. U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in this week on domestic Canadian politics, firing insults at Chrystia Freeland and claiming Pierre Poilievre is not a ""MAGA guy"" as his deadline to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods inches closer. In an interview with The Spectator published today, Trump called the Liberal leadership candidate terrible and ""a whack"" and claimed credit for Freeland’s resignation as finance minister. The wide-ranging interview did not include comments on Freeland’s rivals for the Liberal leadership. Advance voting in the race began Wednesday ahead of the March 9 vote to select Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s successor. Meanwhile, a Globe and Mail investigation has found the Trump administration is using misleading fentanyl figures to justify tariffs against Canada, relying on a dataset that includes drugs traced to Mexico. This is the daily Politics Insider newsletter, written by Ian Bailey . It is available exclusively to our digital subscribers. You can sign up for more than 20 other newsletter on our signup page . What else is going on Canadian economy outpaced expectations in year’s final quarter: Statistics Canada linked the increase in real gross domestic product largely to a surge in household spending. Ontario voter turnout rate on par with record low in 2022 election, early results show: ""I think it’s a sign that people were not motivated by the candidates,"" said John Beebe, founder of the Democratic Engagement Exchange at Toronto Metropolitan University. Quebec could extend religious symbols ban to school staff other than teachers: Education Minister Bernard Drainville says he wants to strengthen secularism in schools by passing legislation on gender equality and expanding the scope of the religious symbol ban for public employees. Many public servants in biggest departments breaking Ottawa’s remote work rules: A Treasury Board document says penalties for violating the in-office work rule can include verbal reprimand, written reprimand, suspension without pay and termination of employment.

Poilievre's path not as easy as Ford's,2025.0,"Doug Ford now has everything that federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has wanted for quite a while: an election out of the way early this year and a comfortable majority, with Liberals and New Democrats consigned to the sidelines for the next four years. All those goals are still within the sights of the federal Conservatives, but the route there is not looking as easy as Ford made it look in his snap Ontario election. In just the four weeks it took for Ford to call and conduct that campaign, Poilievre and the Conservatives have seen their lead slipping in the polls in a way that could be prompting some serious panic behind closed doors. The Ipsos polling firm reported this week - in a finding staggering to many political observers - that federal Liberals are now polling higher than the Conservatives for the first time since 2021. On Jan. 29, the day the Ontario election was called, Ipsos was showing the federal Conservatives with still a healthy lead, 36 per cent compared to 27 per cent for the Liberals. Ipsos measures its precision through what is called a ""credibility interval"" and in the case of these two polls, conducted a month apart, the results are considered accurate within 3.8 percentage points. That means this narrow Liberal lead is well within the margin of error, but it is an illustration of just how quickly things have been moving in this crazy political year that is 2025. In Ontario, however, the past four weeks have been less tumultuous. Ford went into the election with a significant lead, and emerged on Thursday night with the same. It is actually an interesting difference - Ontarians appear to be leaning toward a desire for stability, while the federal scene is dominated by tectonic change. Liberals are in the midst of choosing a new leader to replace Justin Trudeau and the country is on the verge of a federal election, probably not too long after that replacement is chosen next weekend. The big question for that election is whether Canadians are indeed as interested in change as they were before Donald Trump came crashing back into our political life. Even though Ford wanted an Ontario election with Trump as the focus, it's looking like that's far more likely in the federal campaign. Certainly Trump has shaken things up for Poilievre's chances, with other polls starting to show that voters may be leaning toward the idea that the presumed front-runner in the Liberal race, former bank governor Mark Carney, is better placed to deal with Trump's chaos. Carney, criticized by some as being too low key, may find that actually serves him. If Canadians are looking for an anti-Trump, in fact, Carney's no-drama style may represent everything Trump is not. Carney himself was inviting viewers of this week's English-language debate to see Poilievre as a Trump-like figure. ""Who's the worst person to stand up to Donald Trump? It's Pierre Poilievre,"" Carney said. ""He worships the man. He uses his language."" Once upon a time, Liberals would have been slamming Ford in a similar way, calling him Canada's version of Trump too, but that was before the COVID pandemic and Trudeau's government increasingly found ways to work with Ford's Progressive Conservatives. They have learned, as we all have, that there is a big difference between Ford and Poilievre and between federal Conservatives and its Ontario counterpart, which has kept the ""progressive"" in its name. If Poilievre was looking for a chance to help out Ford's party in the provincial election now over, it wasn't obvious. Nor did it seem that Ford went looking for that help. In fact, as my Queen's Park colleagues reported as far back as last spring, it was precisely the threat of a Poilievre win that pushed Ford into calling an election well ahead of 2026, when it was supposed to be held. For all these reasons and more, no one should expect Ford to mix it up in the federal contest. Ford has stayed out of the past two federal election campaigns when Poilievre's predecessors were up against Trudeau; there is little chance the Ontario premier is going to throw the weight of his newly acquired victory behind his federal cousins. One thing all the federal parties will be monitoring closely in the Ontario results will be the turnout figures. Early indications were that this snap election didn't get Ontario voters fired up. Any federal campaign, following so closely on the heels of this one in Canada's largest province, runs the real risk of causing further fatigue, not to mention testing the resources of the parties themselves in terms of volunteer motivation and morale. So Ford may have found himself exactly where Poilievre hoped to land this winter, but his snap election may not have made things a snap for any of the federal parties.

In fact, as my Queen's Park colleagues reported as far back as last spring, it was precisely the threat of a Poilievre win that pushed Ford into calling an election well ahead of 2026, when it was supposed to be held. For all these reasons and more, no one should expect Ford to mix it up in the federal contest. Ford has stayed out of the past two federal election campaigns when Poilievre's predecessors were up against Trudeau; there is little chance the Ontario premier is going to throw the weight of his newly acquired victory behind his federal cousins. One thing all the federal parties will be monitoring closely in the Ontario results will be the turnout figures. Early indications were that this snap election didn't get Ontario voters fired up. Any federal campaign, following so closely on the heels of this one in Canada's largest province, runs the real risk of causing further fatigue, not to mention testing the resources of the parties themselves in terms of volunteer motivation and morale. So Ford may have found himself exactly where Poilievre hoped to land this winter, but his snap election may not have made things a snap for any of the federal parties.

Letters: Poilievre shows sudden change of heart on 'broken' Canada,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre has blamed Justin Trudeau for Canada being ""broken"" for years. This recently included blaming the Liberals for our over-dependence on the U.S. for our exports. In 2014, the last year of the Stephen Harper government, 76.9 per cent of our exports were to the U.S.; in 2024, under Trudeau, it was 75.9 per cent. The pipeline from Alberta to tidewater was saved from oblivion, at great expense and over significant opposition, by the federal Liberal government. The Alberta provincial conservative government spent $1.5 billion of taxpayers' money to buy a pipeline to the U.S. and provided a $6-billion loan guarantee. It was never built and, if it had been, it would have worsened our dependence on the U.S. market and increased the trade surplus that so bothers the guy who some Conservatives were ""100 per cent happy"" to see elected. It is also inconvenient for Poilievre to be talking about enhancing international relations when he has followed Trump in promising withdrawal from international organizations. It isn't surprising that Poilievre is now talking tough as a patriotic Canadian, no longer enamoured with the Republicans. It is too bad he wouldn't pick some issues where his statements are not refuted by easily available statistics. David Steele, Saskatoon Charter schools fail to address real issues I am writing in response to Janet Nett's opinion piece: ""Saskatchewan should consider charter schools amid education crisis."" I fail to see how charter schools would address the problems she outlines - failing achievement levels, increased classroom complexities - and still meet the goals of Saskatchewan education which, over several years of planning documents, have articulated principles of equitable access and opportunity for the success of every child, as well as the development of a society that fosters the well-being of all. While pitched in the language of 'parental choice,' charter schools in practice may be more about whom one's children sit beside, rather than a fair chance for every child to succeed. They may in practice siphon off the more academically or athletically able students from those whose growth and development are hindered by economic or health-related circumstances. All students are then deprived of the rich life experiences of working and learning together in diverse groups. Supports are required to maximize the learning value of diverse classrooms and supports cost money, which a flat per-student allotment does not cover. Saskatchewan's relative poor performance on international student achievement tests is not surprising. A 20 per cent reduction in per-student funding over a decade is bound to have an impact. Let's see what we can do with increased supports to our current system. Dianne Miller, Saskatoon Share your views The StarPhoenix welcomes letters to the editor.

Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives projected to form third majority government:   Early returns suggest Ford’s PC Party is leading in more than 70 seats across the province,2025.0,"Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford was set to win a third majority government in an election he called more than a year early to mount a campaign that focused on his vows to fight U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs. Early returns suggested Mr. Ford was on track to form government, with his PC Party leading or declared elected in more than 70 seats across the province. At dissolution, the PCs had held 79 of the Ontario Legislature’s 124 seats. Marit Stiles, who heads the NDP, was on track to lead her party to win more than 20 seats. The party held 28 seats when the legislature was dissolved. The Liberals, under Leader Bonnie Crombie, the former mayor of Mississauga, were leading or elected in 12 seats in early results. The Green Party, led by Mike Schreiner, had two seats when the election was called, was leading or elected in 2 seats. In a winter campaign hampered by snowstorms and overshadowed by events in Washington, polls had consistently shown Mr. Ford set to win a crushing victory over his rivals, expanding his majority. He repeatedly said he needed a longer and stronger mandate to face down the threat coming from the U.S. In the campaign before Thursday’s vote, both Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie took aim at Mr. Ford’s move to call an early election, which took place after the government distributed $200 cheques to most residents. They accused the PC Leader of trying to get ahead of any charges that could result from the RCMP’s criminal investigation into his government’s aborted plan to allow select developers to build housing on parts of the protected Greenbelt lands. Mr. Ford maintained throughout the campaign that he needed a new mandate from the public in the face of Mr. Trump’s tariff threats and vowed to spend upward of $40-billion to protect the provincial economy. He also travelled twice to Washington to lobby U.S. lawmakers on trips the opposition dismissed as campaign photo-ops. His slick TV ads, which made use of his appearances on American cable TV news channels, presented him as a fighter who would stand up to the President. But while in the U.S. capital, Mr. Ford and fellow premiers were only able to meet with lower-level White House staff, and came away with no guarantees that tariffs would be avoided – or that Canada would not be taken over by the U.S. Struggling to get attention amid the crisis caused by Mr. Trump, Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie ran campaigns targeting Mr. Ford on other issues, such as the struggling health care system, which has left 2.5 million Ontarians without a family doctor, and long wait times in jammed emergency rooms. The PCs promised to spend $1.8-billion to connect two million people with family physicians on the eve of the election call, something the Liberals and NDP dismissed as too little, too late. They also criticized Mr. Ford for failing to build enough housing, with housing starts in Ontario falling well behind those in some other provinces. Ms. Crombie pledged a middle-class income-tax cut, while Ms. Stiles promised a monthly rebate for low and middle-income families to offset the cost of groceries. Few of the opposition’s attacks seemed to affect support for Mr. Ford, even though he suffered from low approval ratings and was caught on camera saying he was ""100-per-cent"" happy when Mr. Trump was elected last November. Mr. Ford said afterward that he would never support Mr. Trump again. Mr. Ford and his wife, Karla, voted in his Toronto riding of Etobicoke North on Thursday morning, as the city, still digging out from recent heavy winter snowfall, was hit by a morning round of wet snow that left roads slippery. On Wednesday, Mr. Ford told supporters in Windsor that he wanted to ""be premier forever."" He also defended his practice of forbidding PC candidates from attending all-candidates debates in their ridings, saying he would rather they spend the time knocking on doors. Critics have called the strategy anti-democratic. Ms. Stiles, who voted previously in early polls in her Toronto riding of Davenport, made an appearance in Liberal-held Beaches-East York, in the city’s east end. Ms. Crombie accompanied her 89-year-old mother, Veronica Sawarna, to the polls in Etobicoke-Lakeshore, as she asked voters who wanted change and a better health care system to support her party. Heading into the vote Thursday, PC pollster Nick Kouvalis said he believed the party could win about 89 seats. The PCs had hoped to expand their support during the campaign, targeting regions such as Windsor, London, Hamilton, Niagara and the North. Both opposition parties were caught scrambling to prepare for the early vote, even though Mr. Ford had declined to rule out the possibility of an early election as long ago as last May. The Liberals, rebuilding after defeats that saw them lose government in 2018 and get left again with a single-digit seat count in 2022, were hoping to pick up additional seats in key Toronto ridings. On Wednesday, Ms. Crombie insisted that she was still aiming to win the vote. In recent weeks, she had asked NDP voters to support her, with polls showing her in a still-distant second place for much of the campaign. Ms. Stiles dismissed this as desperate. But she had previously asked progressive Liberals to vote NDP, arguing that Ms. Crombie, who came into her post vowing to steer her party to the centre-right, is too much like Mr. Ford. Throughout the campaign, Ms. Stiles has said that the NDP was aiming at what she called ""Blue-Orange"" seats, held by the PCs, that her party hoped to flip. But Ms. Stiles also spent time in NDP-held areas, where candidates were facing stiff challenges from a PC Party that has boasted of a growing list of mostly construction and skilled-trades unions offering them support.

Tories quiet as Liberal support rises:   National polls show Poilievre's Conservatives losing their edge with Trudeau no longer a target,2025.0,"The picture painted by Canada's public opinion polling firms is becoming more clear: the Conservatives can no longer bank on the enviable leads they held when Justin Trudeau was Liberal leader. One of the prime minister's likeliest successors, former central banker Mark Carney, has signalled he may be open to triggering a federal election sooner rather than later. And as for whether any of this poses a problem for Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives? They don't seem to want to weigh in. This week, an Ipsos poll conducted for Global News suggested that if an election were held now, the Liberals - regardless of who their leader is - could eke out a victory over the Conservatives for the first time since 2021. Nanos Research found that although the Conservatives still emerged on top, the gap between the parties had slightly narrowed. EKOS Research Associates reported that the Liberals edged ahead of the Conservatives for the first time since 2022, positioning them in a ""virtual tie."" Léger Marketing found that a Liberal party with Carney at the helm would best Poilievre in terms of voting intentions. Abacus Data, meanwhile, found that the number of Canadians who would vote for the Conservatives now dropped five percentage points to 41 per cent, compared to the Liberals, who, no matter their leader, jumped two percentage points to 29 per cent. Those numbers, shared exclusively with the Star, come from Abacus's latest survey, which was conducted with 1,500 Canadians from Feb. 20 to 25. Because respondents were surveyed online, the poll cannot be considered truly random. A comparable random sample of the same size would have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.53 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. ""The gap has been closing, steadily but very rapidly, between the Liberals and the Conservatives,"" said Philippe J. Fournier, who runs 338Canada, a website focused on polling analysis and seat projections. Fournier said that four polls in the past week put the Conservatives below 40 per cent support, something he said has not happened since August 2023. ""This is a dramatic, dramatic turnaround,"" Fournier said. The question the Liberals are contemplating now is whether that turnaround could deliver them a victory - and when. Carney was asked Monday about the circumstances under which he might trigger an early election, should he win the race to replace Trudeau. He said he first wanted to see what shape the threats from U.S. President Donald Trump would take. ""We'll do the best thing for Canada,"" Carney told reporters. ""It is more likely that the best thing for Canada is that the government has a strong and clear mandate sooner to take the necessary steps to build this country."" It could be in the Liberals' best interests to plunge into a campaign as soon as a new leader is elected, said Greg MacEachern, a principal at KAN Strategies and a former Liberal adviser. ""It really comes down to being in control of your own destiny, or letting the agenda of Parliament dictate it,"" said MacEachern of triggering an election before opposition parties force one by declaring a loss of confidence in the government. A return to Parliament with Carney in the top job has the added downside of having a leader who does not sit in the House of Commons. An early election call would also rip up the runway for the Conservatives to spend millions of dollars on attack ads: the party brought in a whopping $41.7 million in fundraising last year. According to Elections Canada, the spending limit for political parties in the coming campaign is expected to sit at just over $35 million, meaning the Conservatives would have cash to spare in the lead-up to a contest. Nevertheless, MacEachern said there are signs Carney has ""fundraising chops,"" given that he's brought in more than $4 million in the weeks since launching his leadership campaign. Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, said attention must also turn to the New Democrats. ""Really, what has driven the surge towards the Liberals is not a stampede of Conservative voters away from the Conservative party. They've lost some support, but really, the implosion has occurred on the NDP side,"" Kurl said. Fournier said that puts pressure on the Liberals to move quickly. ""Why would you give the NDP a chance to recover?"" he said. The Conservatives don't appear keen to talk about the changing tides. Tory MPs dodged questions this week about the polling numbers, why Liberal fortunes may be improving, and whether Poilievre must change his strategy. ""What we're hearing from Canadians is that they want us to execute a plan that will put Canada first after nine years of pain, misery and expense caused by the Carney-Trudeau Liberals,"" Conservative MP Michael Barrett told reporters Wednesday. When asked to explain why public approval for the Liberals is on the rise, Barrett said there was ""strong resonance"" with his party's plan among voters.

Ontario PC Leader Doug Ford says he wants to be premier 'forever',2025.0,"Ontario's political party leaders made their final pitches to voters Wednesday, a day before the province heads to the polls, with Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford saying he wants to be premier ""forever"" while his rivals ask Ontarians to choose change. Ford is looking to secure a third consecutive majority government and said Wednesday that his party is the only one that can stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump and his tariff threats. Ford seemed confident after starting the day just outside of Windsor, Ont., the city where he launched his re-election campaign last month. ""I just want to win,"" he said. ""I want to win a majority, a large majority."" That way, Ontarians would ""send a message down to Donald Trump that we're a force to be reckoned with,"" he said, wearing a Canada hockey jersey with the number 51 on the back and a nameplate that read ""NEVER"" - a reference to Trump's ""51st state"" jibes. When asked if this election would be his last, Ford said: ""I want to be premier forever."" Ford has made the tariff threat central to his re-election campaign over the past month, pledging to spend billions to protect workers. He is positioning himself as the only leader with the ability to deal with Trump, who is threatening 25 per cent tariffs on goods and 10 per cent tariffs on energy that could come into force as soon as next week. ""No one agrees with President Trump declaring an economic war against his closest ally, his closest friend,"" Ford said. ""So folks, we're going to fight like we've never fought before. I'm going to make sure we protect the families, we're going to protect the businesses, protect the jobs, and we're going to protect the communities, and we're going to get through this."" He was stumping near Windsor, Ont., hoping to help sway voters in Windsor West, the last non-blue seat west of London, Ont. His campaign was set to make its way back to the Greater Toronto Area with several stops along the way. The last planned stop of the day: Mississauga East-Cooksville, the riding Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie is hoping to win to secure a seat in the legislature. Crombie has made health care reform a central theme of her campaign, and on Wednesday she reiterated her promises to get everyone in Ontario a family doctor and end hallway medicine. ""If you want change and you want a family doctor, we have to change the government,"" she said at a campaign stop in Oakville, Ont., adding that Ford has failed on health care. ""So tomorrow I'm asking for your vote."" Crombie said she was looking forward ""to a great win"" Thursday. ""We play to win and that's what I'm quite sure we're going to do,"" Crombie said. Most polls had Ford well ahead of a second-place Crombie the day before the election. Last week, Crombie asked NDP voters to change their minds and vote for her in order to beat Ford. She cast her net wider on Wednesday. ""You may have supported another party in another time in another election, but tomorrow we're asking for your support so that we can bring change and we can change this government,"" she said. At a stop in Toronto-St. Paul's riding, NDP Leader Marit Stiles said her party was the only one that would provide real change for Ontarians. ""You have the power through your vote to fight rising costs with a grocery rebate program, with real rent control and to put food on the table of so many Ontarians."" She said the Liberals are no different than the Progressive Conservatives and it's the NDP that will bring in measures to make life more affordable. Stiles also clapped back at Crombie's pitch to NDP voters. ""The Liberals are telling you that they are entitled to your vote,"" Stiles said. ""Well, you know what, the Liberals aren't entitled to anything."" The NDP have focused a lot of its campaign on the affordability crisis and have pledged to bring back rent control, build or buy 300,000 affordable rental homes and create 60,000 supportive homes to help end encampments and chronic homelessness. Stiles was scheduled to spend much of her final campaign day in ridings the NDP already holds. Some polls suggest the New Democrats have been shedding support in the lead-up to Thursday's snap election. ""We are actually going into a lot of ridings that we want to hold for sure,"" Stiles said. ""We know we can do it, but we'll be connecting as we have been for the last few days in ridings where we want to flip from blue to orange."" Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner was in his home riding of Guelph before heading to Kitchener to canvass with Aislinn Clancy, who won the Greens' second ever seat in the legislature in a byelection in 2023. Polls open at 9 a.m. and close at 9 p.m. eastern time on Thursday. They are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. central time in the western part of the province. - With files from Rianna Lim in Toronto, Sharif Hassan in Windsor and Maan Alhmidi in Oakville.

"John Rustad acknowledges divisions in B.C. Conservative party: 'As a family, you have these issues'",2025.0,"Days before the B.C. Conservatives gather for their annual general meeting in Nanaimo, Leader John Rustad is facing questions about internal divisions after several unsuccessful candidates, including a party board member, called for his resignation. Tensions between Conservative MLAs who hold differing views on Aboriginal reconciliation and how to respond to U.S. tariff threats have been on display this week in the legislature. NDP MLA Jennifer Blatherwick tried to exploit these tensions Monday with a motion calling for a unified approach to target U.S. Republican states if tariffs were put in place. Although almost all Conservatives voted for the motion, five voted against and one abstained. ""As a family, you have these issues,"" Rustad told reporters Tuesday. ""People forget we built this party from nothing to winning 44 seats and just missing out on forming government in 18 months. You're going to have issues."" Those who voted against the motion by Blatherwick included Tara Armstrong of Kelowna-Lake Country-Coldstream; Dallas Brodie of Vancouver-Quilchena; Brent Chapman of Surrey-South; Jordan Kealy of Peace River-North; and Heather Maahs of Chilliwack-North. Harman Bhangu of Langley Abbotsford abstained. Conservative whip Bruce Banman called the motion a ""trap"" and said members weren't told how to vote. He said British Columbians want representatives who vote their conscience. While the party denies there are any rifts, there have been other challenges, with former candidates Bryan Breguet and Paul Ratchford, who is also a party board member, calling for Rustad to step down, and for a leadership review if he doesn't. READ MORE: B.C. Conservatives say internal dissent is a virtue. It's also a distraction ""John Rustad was the right guy to take the party from two per cent to 40 per cent. But he isn't the right guy to take it to victory,"" said Breguet on social media. ""The main problem is that Rustad is really, fundamentally, just a boring old B.C. Liberals type, except he's very stupid on some topics. And he doesn't really satisfy anybody on the right."" Within the caucus itself, issues of reconciliation and policing have caused disagreements. Over the weekend, MLA Dallas Brodie defended lawyer James Heller over his request that the Law Society of B.C. change its training materials to say burial sites have ""potentially"" been found at the Kamloops residential school. In her post, Brodie said: ""The number of confirmed child burials at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School site is zero."" The Tk'emlúps First Nation in Kamloops announced in 2021 that they had found grave sites on the residential school grounds. They later clarified they found 215 ""anomalies"" that could be grave sites but further investigation was needed. Brodie's comments drew instant blowback online and resulted in Rustad asking her to take the post down, which she refused to do. ""I don't think standing for truth takes away anything from the severity of what happened at the residential schools,"" Brodie told reporters. Conservative House Leader Á'a:líya Warbus, a member of the Stó:lo Nation, criticized Brodie's stance on social media. She said Tuesday that anything that distracts from reconciliation isn't helpful. ""I want the topic of reconciliation to continue to focus on the survivors that are still with us,"" said Warbus. ""Anything that's going to trigger a response in them that's negative and that's going to take us away from the path of reconciliation is not conducive to the work that we need to do with First Nations communities and non-Indigenous communities across British Columbia."" Chapman defended Brodie and alleged the money being sent to Indigenous communities for investigations into potential graves has been misspent. He did appear to agree, though, with Warbus that the focus needs to be on those affected by the harm they suffered at residential schools. This isn't the first time since the B.C. election that disagreements among Conservative MLAs have come out publicly, with 13 members, including Brodie and Chapman, signing a letter in December calling on Rustad to discipline Surrey-Cloverdale MLA Elenore Sturko over her support for the resignation of Vancouver police board member Comfort Sakoma-Fadugba. Sakoma-Fadugba had made comments that the ""push for secular education isn't about religion - it's about erasing Christian values from the lives of our children."" She also accused ""woke culture"" of pitting ""children against their parents by creating a judicial system where parents can be incarcerated for refusing to let their minor child undergo gender transitions."" Sturko called these comments offensive to transgender people, to which a number of her party colleagues responded that Sturko had engaged in ""cancel culture."" Despite the various blowups, a number of MLAs said the party remains united and they aren't worried about a potential fracture. The challenge for Rustad is to chart a path forward for the B.C. Tory party, says strategist Allie Blades, with the annual meeting crucial to those efforts. Elections for the party board and for potential constitutional changes will both take place and a leadership review is scheduled for sometime in the fall when the Conservatives are scheduled to have another major meeting. The party is estimated to have 10,000 members and each of the province's 93 ridings have been offered 10 voting delegates, but with only about 600 people expected to show up, not every riding has taken up that offer. ""This is an opportunity for the leader to really show those oppositional voices whether or not he has the confidence of the board, the incoming board and the membership,"" said Blades. ""All caucuses, all across Canada, aren't all in agreement about all things all the time, but they're maybe a little bit better at keeping it within the caucus meetings behind closed doors. Right now, what we're seeing is a little bit more of the public unfolding of these disagreements."" Blades said Rustad's own style is to let members vote their conscience and it is yet to be determined whether that is a good or a bad thing. She warned, however, that if these kinds of disagreements continue to play out publicly, some MLAs could decide not to run again, or even resign their positions.

"Five takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates:   Trump and Poilievre are top of mind, but carbon pricing is on the way out",2025.0,"The four candidates for the Liberal Party leadership sparred during four hours of debate, first in French Monday and in English Tuesday, to argue why they’re the best option to lead the party and the country. Here are five takeaways from the exchanges between former central bank governor Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, former House leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis. Donald Trump’s ubiquity U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s economy and sovereignty dominated the debates, with each candidate saying they are in the best position to deal with such an unpredictable neighbour. Ms. Freeland said ""Trump is the greatest challenge Canada has faced since the Second World War"" and touted her experience dealing with him during his first term to renegotiate NAFTA. Mr. Carney countered that Mr. Trump is different this time around and put forward his experience managing the 2007-2008 financial crisis as the governor of the Bank of Canada. ""Then his objective was to take more of our market,"" he said. ""Now he wants to take our country."" Mr. Baylis called Mr. Trump a bully and said that, as a businessman, he was familiar with his type. He described Mr. Trump’s plans to impose hefty tariffs on Canadian imports, in particular energy, as empty threats and said the government needs to ""call his bluff."" Ms. Gould said the U.S. depends on Canadian goods and that she would ""make sure that we put everything on the table"" to protect local industries. Jabs at Pierre Poilievre The four candidates spent considerable time Tuesday night looking past the Liberal leadership race to attack Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, often characterizing him as an admirer and imitator of Mr. Trump. Ms. Freeland said Mr. Poilievre ""actually agrees with Trump,"" in that ""they both say that Canada is broken."" She said the Conservative Leader ""does not believe in affordable housing"" and wants to impose cuts to the public health care system. Ms. Gould said she knows ""how to stand up to people like Pierre Poilievre, who, when it comes to Donald Trump, would rather imitate him than stand up for Canada."" Mr. Carney said Mr. Poilievre is ""the worst person to stand up to Donald Trump"" because he ""worships the man, he uses his language."" He also said it was irresponsible for Mr. Poilievre not to get a security clearance so he could be briefed on foreign interference matters, a process Mr. Carney said he has started. Mr. Baylis said he is ""best suited to defeat Pierre Poilievre and expose him for exactly what he is: He’s a career politician who likes to make up slogans and nothing else."" Defence spending and the Arctic front of mind The issues of military spending and defence of the Arctic figured prominently and offered evidence of disagreement among the candidates Tuesday. Ms. Gould and Ms. Freeland took issue with Mr. Carney’s position on defence spending. Under his leadership, the government would hit the NATO target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence by 2030, but the other candidates said they would do it faster. ""We have to actually make sure that we are investing here in Canada reaching those targets, because our country, our sovereignty, is under threat,"" Ms. Gould said in pointing out Mr. Carney’s position. ""The time to make those investments is now."" He responded by saying he’ll spend the money on Canadian procurement as fast as possible, calling it a ""management thing."" When her turn came, Ms. Freeland said defence spending is about will and the country should be working with its Nordic partners to protect the Arctic. ""I don’t think any of us wants to be the leader who was asleep at the wheel and didn’t get Canada defended,"" she said at a different point. She committed to reaching the 2-per-cent NATO target by 2027, as did Ms. Gould. Mr. Baylis did not commit to a target, saying, ""I don’t think that’s doable in an intelligent way."" He called, however, for better pay and benefits for the military and more investments in research and development. Carbon pricing is out, more pipelines are in With three of the four candidates expressing unmitigated support for building new pipelines and dropping carbon pricing, the Liberal Party appears poised to embrace the expansion of fossil fuel exploitation and scale back its commitments to climate action. Ms. Freeland said Canada needs to ""double down"" on energy exports, and Mr. Baylis committed to building two new pipelines to get fossil fuel to the coasts. When asked about a potential resurrection of the Keystone XL pipeline , which would transport crude from Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refiners, both said this was good news. Mr. Carney said he would embark on cross-provincial ""projects of national interest,"" including building pipelines. The three of them also said they would abandon carbon pricing for consumers, which Mr. Carney said has become ""too divisive."" Ms. Freeland walked a fine line, praising Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for putting a price on pollution but saying Canadians ""didn’t think that policy worked for them."" Mr. Baylis said carbon pricing is ""not working"" and that he would ""adapt it."" Ms. Gould was an outlier on that front, calling carbon pricing a badly communicated policy that became an affordability issue. ""I’m not going to abandon the fight against climate change because Pierre Poilievre is telling us to do that,"" she said. ""If you don’t have the price on pollution, you don’t have the rebate cheques that millions of Canadians depend on."" She was non-committal on pipelines, simply saying that Canadians need to ""have a conversation"" about energy security. Differing French fluency The candidates’ differing levels of fluency in French underpinned Monday night’s debate. Mr. Baylis was the most comfortable in Quebec’s official language, followed closely by Ms. Gould. Both were able to articulate their ideas clearly, despite forgivable grammar mistakes. Ms. Gould said her command of French best positions her to spar with other federal leaders. The two front-runners, for their part, spoke with a careful, slow and at times awkward rhythm, relying on rehearsed lines and highlighting a limited vocabulary. Ms. Freeland was hesitant on a few occasions but also capitalized on Mr. Carney’s gaffes, correcting him when he misspoke and completing a sentence when he searched for words. After Monday’s debate, Mr. Carney said he nonetheless looks forward to debating Mr. Poilievre and Yves-François Blanchet, the Bloc Québécois Leader, in French if he wins the Liberal leadership. On several occasions, Mr. Carney repeated that Canadians must be ""masters in our own home"" ( maîtres chez nous in French). This reference to a campaign slogan promoting hydroelectric nationalization in the 1960s by former Quebec Liberal premier Jean Lesage, a key figure of the province’s Quiet Revolution, was an obvious appeal to the Liberals’ Quebec base. Tuesday’s debate moved at a faster pace, with Ms. Freeland and Mr. Carney noticeably more comfortable in English, though all four candidates used some of the exact same phrases from Monday’s debate.

"U.S. threat looms large in debate:   Rivals clash over plans to take on Trump, Poilievre",2025.0,"In a debate largely dominated by concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump, the four candidates for the Liberal leadership laid out their plans to fortify Canada against American tariffs, while one candidate, Karina Gould, took a sharper edge against her competitors. The second of two official debates in the contest saw the leadership contenders spar over how fast they would expand military spending, who would best address Canadians' affordability struggles, and how to grow the economy and keep up the fight against the climate crisis. The two-hour showcase also featured more pointed exchanges than the previous night's French debate, with Gould, the former government House leader, in particular taking aim at her rivals over their approaches to the economy and their plans to scrap the Trudeau government's consumer carbon price. More often, though, the candidates took shots at the politician they all see as their ultimate opponent: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. ""We will only win the next election by being Liberals, proudly, not Conservative-lite, not by running from the progress we've made,"" Gould said. The spectre of Trump came up early, just as it did in the French debate one day earlier, with all candidates trying to convince viewers that they're best placed to take him on. Mark Carney, the former central banker, said the next prime minister needs to use this crisis to reinforce and build Canada's economy, accusing Trump of seeking to ""dominate the hemisphere"" with threats to annex Canada and take Greenland and the Panama Canal. ""This is a crisis of sovereignty,"" said Carney. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland - who declared she had found ""personal liberation"" during the contest to replace Trudeau as prime minister - again leaned on her experience leading the government's response to Trump when he was first in office from 2017 to 2021. ""If I am prime minister, I will not flinch ... If you hit us, we will hit back,"" she said, promising a targeted response that hits Elon Musk's Tesla cars, Florida orange juice, Wisconsin dairy products and other American goods with Canadian counter-tariffs. Gould promised to take a similarly tough stand, declaring that ""men like Donald Trump have always underestimated leaders like me, but they underestimate me, and that's their mistake."" Former MP and Montreal businessman Frank Baylis said he knows Trump is a ""bully"" and said he would take a stand with Mexico - whom Trump has also threatened with tariffs - and remove Canada's $1.3-billion plan to beef up border security, which he argued is an unnecessary response to Trump's exaggerated concerns about drugs and illegal immigrants. ""This is not a negotiation. This is a shakedown,"" he said. At various points during the debate, the candidates also tried to link Poilievre to Trump. Freeland alleged the Conservative leader wants to ""imitate"" the U.S. president, while Carney claimed Poilievre ""worships Trump."" During a discussion about Trump's impact on foreign affairs, Gould pressed Carney on his plan to increase defence spending. He has pledged to increase it to Canada's NATO target of two per cent of economic output by 2030, while Gould and Freeland have said they would hit that threshold by 2027. ""We don't have time to wait for this,"" Gould told Carney, adding that she would increase soldiers' salaries, appoint a ""procurement czar"" to speed up military purchases, and - amid reports the Trump administration is looking at pushing Canada out of the Five Eyes intelligence partnership - start a new Canadian agency that can gather foreign intelligence so the country doesn't have to rely so much on the U.S. Canada's spy agency CSIS has strict limits on its operations overseas, restricting it to collecting information directly related to threats against this country. Carney responded to the criticism by stating the government can't ""just push money out the door,"" but pledged he would increase military spending as fast as possible, to Canadian industries. He also said Canada must built ""at least"" two new bases in the Arctic. Freeland jumped in, too, suggesting it's wrong that ""managerial or technocratic obstacles should get in the way of defending Canada"" and insisted its time to ""step up."" Trump's impact also coloured discussion about the economy, with Freeland arguing the U.S. is now the biggest threat to prosperity. She said she would cut red tape to get projects built and direct procurement to Canadian businesses. She also accused Poilievre of planning to bring in ""cruel austerity"" that will harm Canadians and make affordability woes worse, and claimed he would cut health-care spending. ""All he believes in is cuts. Cuts, cuts, cuts,"" Freeland charged. ""And that is one of the things that motivates me as a Liberal to defeat the Conservatives in the next election."" Carney said average wages haven't kept pace with the rising cost of living, promising a ""middle-class tax cut"" and to remove the federal sales tax from first-time homebuyers. He said he would also increase competition in the grocery and other sectors to help drive down prices, and preserve social programs like child care and pharmacare that the Trudeau government has introduced. In an apparent criticism of the current Liberal government, Carney said spending has grown too much in recent years, leaving the economy ""weak"" even before Trump started threatening tariffs. Moments later, Freeland said ""we need to be very careful not to repeat Conservative talking points,"" and argued that - after serving as finance minister from 2020 to 2024 - Canada's fiscal position is strong. ""I know that we have made it to keep our fiscal fire powder dry because I saw that Trump was coming,"" she said. Baylis, meanwhile, said he would strive to balance the federal budget without raising taxes or making cuts, but by directing policies to grow the economy. Gould countered that productivity alone won't be enough in the face of a possibly huge economic shock. She suggested the other candidates in the race were focusing too much on economic concepts and not enough on people. The candidates also discussed ways to ensure provinces responsibly spend health transfers from Ottawa, and improve health care, generally agreeing on the need to preserve the public system. During a final segment on climate change, Freeland and Carney talked about scrapping the consumer carbon tax-and-rebate system, with Freeland detailing how she would prefer ""carrots"" like clean growth funds and tax incentives over a policy that - under relentless Conservative criticism - Canadians no longer support. Gould, meanwhile, pushed back against her rivals who want to dismantle the consumer price. ""We can't abandon the fight against climate change because Pierre Poilievre is telling us to,"" said Gould.

B.C. high school girls' basketball provincials: The Caitlin Clark effect,2025.0,"Caitlin Clark connects. With her play at the University of Iowa and now the WNBA's Indiana Fever, the 23-year-old Clark is credited with being an engine behind women's basketball powering its way toward a larger mainstream audience. The idea of the Caitlin Clark effect gets thrown around enough that it has its own Wikipedia page It hits here, too, with her name and game resonating with B.C. high school players. The senior girls' basketball provincials are celebrating their 75th anniversary this week. Action begins in all four tiers at the Langley Events Centre on Wednesday, culminating with the finals there Saturday. ""I'll be walking into my class and I'll hear people talking about how Caitlin Clark dropped 50 (points) on Angel Reese last night, and how she's way better than Angel Reese,"" St. Thomas More Knights Grade 10 guard Kyla Limon said, pointing to another of the women's hoops' rising stars. ""People in my grade talk about it. The guys too. ""It's crazy to look at how many people are watching women's sports now compared to even two years ago, and she's such a part of that. And I think she's helping girls get out of their comfort zone and gain confidence in sports."" Riverside Rapids Grade 12 guard Jorja Hart added: ""Caitlin Clark is a big influence. She's showing what girls are capable of doing within sports. She's always super-humble and works hard, and I think that she's a good role model for players in B.C. to have."" All four draws have now been revealed for the 2025 BC Girls Basketball Provincial Championships! Make sure to come out and join us for a great four days of basketball here at LEC. ?? - Langley Events Centre (@LangleyEvents) February 20, 2025 Demicah Arnaldo, who's a Grade 11 guard with Burnaby's STM, says the increased media attention that women's sports in both Canada and the U.S. is getting is easily apparent, and teammate Mia Beliveau, who's a Grade 11 guard/forward, believes that ""it's inspiring to see how women's basketball has grown."" Longtime Riverside coach Paul Langford says Clark's practice routines captured on things like YouTube and her Instagram updates are routinely talking points with his Port Coquitlam squad. He used to cite Michael Jordan and LeBron James as his examples when he was explaining drills and schemes in practice. Now, it's players like Clark and Reese, and Paige Bueckers. Clark is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history - man or woman. One of the reasons for that is her seemingly endless three-point range. You get the feeling at times that she could hit shots from the parking lot. The Fever posted on Instagram in August that Clark's three-pointers at the time were coming from an average of 28 feet, 1.1 inches, which was two feet better than any other player in the league. The WNBA three-point line is at 22 feet, 1.75 inches. Outside shooting has become trendy in boys' basketball in this province the past few years, and it's been attributed to the long-range prowess of Steph Curry. It's happening in the girls' game now, and it's being tied to Clark. ""Every now and then you might mutter, 'Hey, you're not Caitlin Clark. We don't want you jacking it up that much,' "" Langford said with a laugh. ""But, obviously, she's a super-positive influence on the girls' game and women's sports in general. It just helps when you can see it at the next level."" B.C. girls' basketball is taking its own step-up-a-level at these provincials. To celebrate the anniversary, the LEC has tracked down photographs from past championship squads, and a group of coaches and organizers have selected all-decade all-star teams. As well, championship Saturday this time around will be played in the main arena for first time, like the boys' finals are. Last year's championship Saturday for the girls at the LEC's Centre Court was superb, with down-to-the-wire finishes in all four games and countless highlight-reel plays. The atmosphere was raucous throughout. The crowd maxed out at just over 2,000, according to organizers, and there was a suggestion that was a tournament record. The arena is a much bigger venue. There have been boys' finals with game attendances reported at over 6,000. Bobby Braich, who's the longtime coach of Abbotsford's Yale Lions, has been a proponent of moving the championship Saturday to the arena. ""There's the one or two coaches who have reached out to me and said, 'Are we sure we want to do this?' "" Braich explained of the Saturday switch. ""But I think we're going to outperform. I'm so bullish and so excited. I've been at the ground level trying to make this happen and now I'm seeing key people who weren't maybe with this initially who are coming on full force now."" On the road again! Checking in with Prince George's Duchess Park Condors while on their way to BC girls basketball championships! @DPSSCondors @SD57PG @LangleyEvents @garyahuja1 @SteveEwen - Howard Tsumura (@htsumura) February 25, 2025 Part of Braich's inspiration for change, he says, came from watching firsthand Clark at Seattle in the 2023 NCAA Tournament Regional championship. That included Clark scoring or assisting on every field goal in Iowa's 25-point first quarter in the finals against Louisville, en route to finishing with 41 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 97-83 win. ""I walked out of there thinking that was the best female basketball player I've ever seen in my life, and so did everybody else in the building,"" Braich said. ""And it said to me that we need to get this game elevated. We've created really good high school basketball players in this province, but we can give them more of a platform to make a name for themselves. ""Why in B.C. are we struggling with going to the arena bowl? To me, it seems so simplistic. Just put the nice dinner plates out. Quit being so cheap.""

"Liberal leadership hopefuls take on Trump, Poilievre in French debate",2025.0,"This live blog was updated during the federal Liberal leadership debate of Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. Questions/comments: ariga@postmedia.com Top updates Video: Candidates field reporters' questions in post-debate press conferences Video: Watch the entire French debate Quebec's Bill 96 is 'discriminatory,' Baylis says Canada should lure back health workers who went to U.S., Freeland says Liberal immigration targets were 'too ambitious,' Gould says Baylis vows to bring 'budgetary discipline' to Ottawa 'We need free trade in Canada,' Freeland says Federal spending has grown too quickly, Carney says 'If Trump wants to talk to me, he can call me,' Baylis says Poilievre 'prefers division,' Freeland says Trump 'wants our country,' Carney says Canada will never be the 51st state, Carney says How's their French? With Trudeau's exit, Liberals rebound as Quebecers warm to Carney Donald Trump's shadow looms large over tonight's debate Profiles: Here are the four leadership candidates Opinion: Political landscape is shifting in Canada and Quebec 10:30 p.m.: Video: Candidates field reporters' questions in post-debate press conferences 10:20 p.m.: Video: Watch the entire French debate 10 p.m.: Closing statements Baylis says Canadians must be audacious and ambitious. ""Let's together build a Canada we can all be proud of,"" he says. Gould says she has new ideas for Canada. As leader, says she will ""fight for everyday Canadians."" She describes herself as a ""leader for the future."" Carney says Canadians have told him they're worried - that they want positive change from a leader who unites. He says he's that person. He says he's not a politician, but a pragmatist who has ""managed economic crises, built strong economies and settled difficult negotiations."" Freeland says tonight's debate shows Liberals are united. ""Our country is strong, intelligent and united,"" she says. She targets Pierre Poilievre, saying the Conservative leader ""agrees with Trump. They both say Canada is broken."" But Canadians know that's not true and that shows in how people have responded to Trump's threats, she says. 9:55 p.m.: Quebec's Bill 96 is 'discriminatory,' Baylis says The candidates are asked if they would support a Quebec constitution and what they would do about Bill 21, a Quebec secularism law that bars many government workers from wearing religious symbols such as the hijab while on the job. Freeland says the French language is in decline in Quebec and across Canada. She says Donald Trump is a threat to the French language and bilingualism. The federal government must support francophones in the rest of Canada and anglophones in Quebec, she says. As for Bill 21, she says it's not a time for fights because Canadians must remain united. Gould says Liberals defend the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. She says anglophones in Quebec and francophones in other provinces must be supported. As for Bill 21, she says she would support the court challenge. Baylis says he would have to read a Quebec constitution before deciding whether he supports it. He refers to the Legault government's Bill 96, calling it ""discriminatory"" against young francophones because the law makes it harder for them to learn English. He says Bill 21 is ""discriminatory"" and he will continue to fight it. Carney says he's not a lawyer, a judge or a constitutional expert. He says the French language is under threat and Canada should protect institutions such as Radio-Canada. On Bill 21, he says he agrees with Gould on the court challenge, though he respects Quebec's secularism aims. 9:40 p.m.: Canada should lure back health workers who went to U.S., Freeland says The candidates are asked how they would improve the health-care system. Freeland says Canada's health system is part of the country's identity. She says she respects provincial jurisdiction. But the federal government should do more. It should, for example, lure back health workers who moved to the U.S., she says Baylis says Canada can have the world's best health-care system. He says he would train more nurse-practitioners, boost funding for home health services and give more power to pharmacists. Carney says he would remove barriers to the interprovincial movement of nurses and doctors. He says Canada should use more artificial intelligence in the health system. 9:35 p.m. Liberal government immigration targets were 'too ambitious,' Gould says The candidates are asked what they would do about immigration. Baylis says immigration is a good thing for Canada. His father was from England, and his mother was from Barbados. ""That said, we have lost control of the amount of immigration,"" he says, particularly when it comes to temporary workers and students. Carney says all his grandparents were immigrants. But he said back then, Canada was better able to absorb immigrants. He says immigration should be capped so Canada can ""re-establish an equilibrium."" He said ""errors were made"" in recent years. ""Millions and millions"" more housing units must be built, he says. Freeland says Canada must remain welcoming to immigrants, but much more housing is needed. She says she would base future immigration targets on housing availability. She also vows to ensure the qualifications of more foreign-trained doctors are recognized in Canada. Gould says her Liberal government's immigration targets were ""too ambitious."" She says she would work with provinces to establish new targets. 9:20 p.m.: Baylis vows to bring 'budgetary discipline' to Ottawa The candidates are asked what would they would do to help Canadians. Freeland says ""life is too difficult for people"" and Canadians are very worried about the economic threat that Trump represents. She says she would reduce taxes for the middle class, limit credit card interest rates, increase daycare places and create more housing. By contrast, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre ""will cut, cut, cut."" Baylis says he would bring ""budgetary discipline"" to Ottawa. That will increase the value of the Canadian dollar and prices will drop, he says. Gould says she would cut the Goods and Services Tax to four per cent from the current five per cent, help new homebuyers enter the market and end homelessness. Carney says he would cut taxes for middle-class Canadians and scrap the GST for first-time homebuyers. He says he would increase competition in the grocery business and high-speed Internet. 9:15 p.m.: 'We need free trade in Canada,"" Freeland says The candidates are asked what they would do to reduce or eliminate interprovincial trade barriers. Gould says she would set up working groups to focus on the issue. Carney says Canada's economy would greatly improve if the barriers were reduced. He would bring together premiers to work on the issue, and begin by asking them which barriers are ""absolutely essential"" for their provincial economies. Freeland says the moment has come for the interprovincial barriers to be removed. She says Canadians realize that Trump is an ""existential threat"" and that ""we need free trade in Canada."" Baylis says he would support an east-west natural gas pipeline in order to diversify markets. He says that would allow the provinces to work together, opening the door to more interprovincial economic cooperation. 9 p.m.: Federal spending has grown too quickly, Carney says The candidates are asked about Canada's economic situation. Freeland, the former finance minister, says Canada's deficit and debt are under control. She says the federal government should control the growth in the public service and invest in productivity but must not cut services to Canadians. Carney said Canada's spending has been growing far too quickly in recent years. He doesn't answer clearly when asked how he would balance Canada's books while significantly increasing military spending. But he clearly says he would not reduce transfers to provinces. Baylis says Canada must increase productivity. He says he is the only one who has been both a businessperson and politician, giving him the tools needed to be prime minister. Baylis also says he would not cut transfers to provinces. 8:55 p.m.: 'If Trump wants to talk to me, he can call me,' Baylis says The candidates are asked what tone they would take with Donald Trump. Baylis says he wouldn't visit Trump in Washington because he would not want to give the president any leverage. ""If he wants to talk to me, he can call me."" Freeland says she wouldn't immediately negotiate with Trump. Instead, the strategy would be to put pressure on the U.S. by doing things like imposing a 100-per-cent tariff on Teslas. Carney says it's important to build a strong economy before negotiating with Trump because that would give Canada more options. Gould says she would ""explain why Canada is a sovereign country"" and that there are issues that Canada and the U.S. can work on together. 8:45 p.m.: Poilievre 'prefers division,' Freeland says Candidates are asked how they would maintain unity among provinces in a trade war with Trump. Freeland says Canada must remain united in the face of Trump. She says knows how to bring together provinces and territories because she has done it for years as a federal minister. She says Pierre Poilievre is ""unable to unite Canada. He prefers division. He's a leader who is too weak to face Trump."" Carney says the prime minister must bring together premiers to discuss the Trump threat. And he says there should be one Canadian economy - not 13. That's an apparent reference to the need to remove interprovincial trade barriers. He says Poilievre ""venerates Mr. Trump. He can't negotiate with him."" Gould says Trump will be in power for four years. ""We need a prime minister who is strong and can bring people together,"" she says. Gould says Canada can't budge on items of special interest to particular provinces, including the French language in Quebec. Baylis says he would use electricity exports to the U.S. as leverage to force Trump to back down. 8:30 p.m.: Trump 'wants our country,' Carney says The candidates are asked why they're the best placed to deal with Donald Trump. Baylis says he has negotiated hundreds of contracts with Americans as a businessperson. He says he knows how to deal with people like Donald Trump. He says Trump is a bully and you can't give an inch to a bully. Freeland says she has already negotiated with Trump when free trade was on the table during his first presidency. ""We succeeded in getting a better deal,"" she says. Carney responds to Freeland by saying today's Trump is different from first-mandate Trump. ""In the past, (Trump) wanted a part of our markets, Now, he wants our country."" Carney says Canada can't control Trump. But Canada can be masters in our own house. He says some things will not be negotiated with Trump. They include culture, water and supply management. Gould says Canadians are strong and intelligent and can get past this. She says she knows how to deal with Trump - with force. She says Americans need many of Canada's products and Trump must be made to realize that. 8:20 p.m.: Canada will never be the 51st state, Carney says The candidates are asked what Canada can do to open up new markets now that the United States has become a hostile partner. Freeland says: ""We need allies. We have to find them and work with them."" She says she signed free trade deals with Europe and Asia-Pacific countries and Canada must work with those countries even more now. Baylis says Canada must work more closely with the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, which share values, language and types of government. He says that would open up new markets. As a former businessperson, he says he knows how to make business deals. Gould says the federal government must help companies reach diversity beyond the American market. Carney opens by saying Canada will never be part of the United States. He says we must get closer to Europe, the United Kingdom and the Francophonie. 8:15 p.m.: Opening statements Each candidate had 90 seconds. Baylis says he's ""very optimistic about our future. I have hope for Canada, I believe in Canada and Canadians."" He says he will have three priorities: ensuring Canada has a ""strong, resilient economy,"" improving the health system and ""modernizing the Canadian government"" to make it more efficient. Gould says she grew up in the middle class and ""understands what Canadians are living through today"" as they struggle with inflation and other economic problems. ""I'm very proud to be Canadian, especially now when people from across the country are mobilizing."" She says she would battle Donald Trump but also ""our version of Trump"" - an apparent reference to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Freeland says she's in the race to defend Canada against Donald Trump, ""the biggest threat to Canada since the Second World War."" She says she succeeded in protecting the Canadian economy during the first Trump presidency and will do it again. Carney says Canada is currently facing its ""worst crisis of our lives and to get through it we must make major changes."" He says he knows how to ""get past crises and how to build strong economies."" Canadians are ""ready to stand up for Canada. I am as well."" 7:55 p.m.: How's their French? The Liberals under Justin Trudeau did well in Quebec - until their support collapsed last fall With Mark Carney as leader, they could regain ground in the province, according to polls. But first, there's a crucial test tonight: a French test. Francophone commentators have questioned the former central banker's command of Quebec's majority language. The next Liberal leader will eventually have to take on Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, both strong French debaters. None of the four leadership hopefuls are native French speakers. However, Chrystia Freeland has spent years answering questions in French, Karina Gould has called fluency a prerequisite for any prime minister, and Frank Baylis was educated in French at the elementary and high school levels. 7:40 p.m.: Advance voting begins Wednesday From The Canadian Press: With little time remaining until voting begins and just two weeks before the winner is announced, tonight's French debate and tomorrow's English one will be the only opportunities Liberal supporters get to see the candidates together. Advance voting opens on Wednesday for party members. The winner of the race, to be announced March 9, will replace Trudeau as both Liberal leader and prime minister, though a general election call is widely expected soon after the votes are counted. 7:30 p.m.: With Trudeau's exit, Liberals rebound as Canadians - including Quebecers - warm to Carney Justin Trudeau's decision to quit as prime minister and set off a leadership race has certainly helped the Liberals in the polls. ""Tracking over the last four weeks shows an 11-point gain by the federal Liberals with the Conservatives and New Democrats down,"" the pollsters at Nanos Research said Monday. ""NDP support cycling down from the 20s to the mid-teens is bad news for the New Democrats. This implies some likely strategic voting that was not occurring before. ""This makes complete sense. When the Poilievre Conservatives had a 27-point lead - the election looked like a foregone conclusion and voters stuck with their first choice. With the gap narrowing strategic voting starts to kick in and an option emerges to achieve a particular end by blocking another party that a voter finds less appealing. "" Last week, a Léger poll suggested a Liberal party led by Carney would be statistically tied with Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives. It also found that in Quebec, the Liberals would be the clear favourite if Carney were leader. The Liberals would be at 43 per cent, ahead of the Bloc Québécois at 25 per cent and the Conservatives at 22 per cent. 7:15 p.m.: Candidates set the tone with social media posts Né au Québec, grandi dans la culture franco-ontarienne, et fier de mes racines. Je comprends l'importance de protéger et promouvoir notre langue et culture française. Le défi est grand, mais c'est un défi que je suis prêt Ã relever, car le français fait partie de ma culture.... - Frank Baylis (@frankbaylis) February 24, 2025 Il est temps de construire une économie où chacun peut progresser, une économie qui donne Ã chaque Canadien et Canadienne l'optimisme et la confiance que notre avenir sera meilleur que notre passé. - Mark Carney (@MarkJCarney) February 24, 2025 Je vais toujours me battre pour nos agriculteurs, nos fermiers et pour la gestion de l'offre. - Chrystia Freeland (@cafreeland) February 24, 2025 People have always underestimated me- and I've always surprised them. // On m'a toujours sous-estimée-et on a toujours été surpris. - Karina Gould (@karinagould) February 24, 2025 7 p.m.: Donald Trump's shadow looms large over tonight's debate Four Liberal leadership candidates will face off in a debate Monday night in Montreal, but Donald Trump's shadow will loom large. A few hours ago, the U.S. president said devastating duties on products from Canada and Mexico are coming next week after the levies were paused for a month. ""The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,"" Trump said. Trump's executive order to implement 25-per-cent tariffs on all Canadian imports, with a lower 10-per-cent levy on Canadian energy, was delayed until March 4 after Canada agreed to introduce new security measures at the border. Monday's two-hour debate, moderated by former TVA anchor Pierre Jobin, begins at 8 p.m. The first topic will be how to respond to Trump's verbal attacks and economic threats against Canada. The debate will centre on four key themes, according to the party: Canada's place in the world: Canada-U.S. relations, and working with our allies to secure a better future for everyone. Growing a strong economy: Creating jobs and economic growth for all Canadians. Supporting Canadians: Affordability, housing, safer communities, and stronger public health care. Climate action: Protecting our environment while securing Canada's energy future. Each segment will be 25 minutes long. 7 p.m.: Profiles: Here are the four leadership candidates Four candidates are vying to lead the Liberal Party of Canada. Party members will choose their leader on March 9. Whoever wins will become Canada's prime minister. The contenders are: Frank Baylis, a former West Island MP, is the only Quebecer in the race. Born in Montreal but raised in Ontario, Baylis was elected Liberal MP for Pierrefonds-Dollard, one of the safest Liberal seats in Canada, in 2015. He did not seek re-election in 2019. An engineer, Baylis sold his company, Baylis Medical, to Boston Scientific in 2022 for $1.8 billion. Mark Carney, who was born in the Northwest Territories and grew up in Alberta, was governor of the Bank of Canada for five years ending in 2013, a period marked by the 2008 financial crisis. He went on to become the first non-British person to run the Bank of England, steering Britain through the economic and political turmoil sparked by Brexit. More recently, he served as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. This is his first run at public office. Chrystia Freeland, an Alberta-born former journalist, has been an MP since 2013. Most recently, she was finance minister and deputy prime minister before a falling-out with outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Her resignation from cabinet in December triggered an internal crisis that contributed to Trudeau's departure. Over the years, Freeland has held several key portfolios, including international trade, foreign affairs and intergovernmental affairs. Karina Gould An Ontarian, she has been a Liberal MP since 2015. Until recently, she was the government House leader. She previously held other portfolios, including ones focused on families, international development and democratic institutions. Three Liberal ministers from Quebec who were potential leadership contenders opted not to run: Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly and Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon. 7 p.m.: Opinion: Political landscape is shifting in Canada and Quebec U.S. President Donald Trump's threats are a powerful example of how ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" phenomenon can quickly shuffle alliances and priorities. A Léger poll this past week found even with Justin Trudeau heading the Liberals, the Conservative lead has been sliced in half. More notable, with Mark Carney as the potential new Liberal leader, the Tories' lead basically evaporates. The poll indicates most Canadians see Carney, an economist and former governor of the banks of Canada and England, as the most qualified person to lead the country during this Trump turbulence - well ahead of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, a career politician. Poilievre's sarcastic style and penchant for repeating slogans may have been easier for Canadians to digest when he was pummelling Trudeau, the unpopular incumbent. But he will have to pivot against a formidable foe like Carney who comes off as more prime ministerial than he does. Read Robert Libman's column. 7 p.m.: Mark Carney under pressure as leadership candidates prepare for French debate Presumed Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney faces a major test Monday night in Montreal, when he and his rivals square off in person for the first time in a French-language debate. Carney is new to federal politics and his performance will be under the microscope. He'll have to prove to Liberals he can think on his feet in French - and since he has the most to lose, he's expected to spend most of his time on defence. ""Especially after his inaugural speech in Edmonton, some people criticized his French, saying it was not that good. He does speak French, there is no question about it, but I think it will be a test for him,"" said Daniel Béland, political science professor and director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada. ""People will be listening very carefully, especially people in Quebec or francophones, to not just what he says but how well he says it."" Read our full story. 7 p.m.: Chrystia Freeland pledges to consult with Canadians on carbon tax alternatives Liberal leadership contender Chrystia Freeland vows to scrap Canada's consumer carbon pricing regime in favour of alternatives to be developed through wide-ranging consultations. In a policy statement issued Saturday, Freeland also says she is committed to meeting Canada's climate targets by reducing pollution from the biggest emitters, helping people cut their energy bills and building reliable electricity grids. Freeland says her plan will build durable, lasting climate progress without making Canadians pay the cost. She promises to work with provinces and territories, labour leaders, experts, industry, Indigenous Peoples and others to find viable alternatives to consumer carbon pricing. Read our full story. 7 p.m.: Karina Gould has redefined what it means to be a PM's chief attack dog Karina Gould knows how to throw a hefty political punch, and she often does it with a smile. Just six months into her role as government House leader, Gould has redefined what it means to be a prime minister's chief attack dog. During a fall parliamentary sitting that often looked out of control, political insiders say Gould was a steady thorn in her opponents' sides: calm and cutting at the same time. They are crediting her with re-energizing the Liberal caucus after the party's poll numbers plummeted last year, while opposition Conservatives relished in their own gains. Read our full story. 7 p.m.: Frank Baylis says PM, premiers made 'mistakes' with Trump Liberal leadership candidate Frank Baylis says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Canada's premiers have been approaching President Donald Trump's trade threats all wrong. The Montreal businessman said Thursday the leaders have made ""mistake after mistake,"" starting with Trudeau's decision to rush to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort in November soon after he threatened Canada with tariffs. Baylis told The Canadian Press in an interview a government led by him would take the opposite approach. He said the only way to deal with a bully like Trump is to dig in your heels and refuse to offer him anything. ""You don't fly down to his private residence when he's not even the president. That's completely acquiescent to him,"" he said. ""What happened after we visited? Did he become more aggressive or less?""

"With election day looming in Ontario, opposition parties are in uphill fight against Doug Ford:   Liberals’ Bonnie Crombie, NDP’s Marit Stiles lag behind PC Leader, in snap winter voter amid Trump tariff crisis",2025.0,"An Ontario Liberal TV ad, which debuted during the fraught U.S.-Canada hockey final last week, depicts a shivering woman on a gurney being left in a hospital parking lot. It asks viewers: ""What happens after the hallways fill up? Stop Doug Ford before we find out."" It’s unclear whether the unusual spot – which was only 14 seconds long and contained no images of Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie – had any impact on Ontario voters before Connor McDavid fired the puck home to defeat the Americans in overtime. The province’s election campaign is now entering the final minutes of its own third period, with voting set for Thursday. And the Liberal ad was just one of many pucks the opposition has tried to aim at Mr. Ford, the Progressive Conservative Leader who has effortlessly blocked almost every shot he has faced, with polls suggesting he could win a historic third majority government. Both Ms. Crombie and NDP Leader Marit Stiles have had their work cut out for them. Both are rookie leaders, facing a snap election in the dead of winter that left them scrambling to nominate candidates and draw up complete platforms, which they both just released in the last few days. They are also facing an electorate fixated on U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs and use ""economic force"" to take over Canada – threats that Mr. Ford has made the central focus of his campaign. His slogan is ""Protect Ontario."" His slick TV ads call him a fighter, while making use of jump-cut clips of his appearances on U.S. news networks. The PC Party picked up the tab for his trips to Washington to lobby lawmakers there, amid complaints they were unfair photo-ops. Mr. Ford’s focused campaign on the tariff threat has made it next-to-impossible for Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie to shift to other issues, such as the crisis in the province’s health care system, where they feel Mr. Ford is more vulnerable. His opponents also point to the current RCMP investigation into Mr. Ford’s aborted move to open up parts of the protected Greenbelt to select developers, accusing him of calling an early election to get ahead of any potential charges. But Mr. Ford has remained the first choice for Ontario voters, by double-digit margins in most polls for months – long before he took up his anti-tariff fight and despite public-opinion data also showing low approval ratings for him personally. Nothing in the campaign has significantly moved the needle, not even his ""hot mic"" moment, when he admitted on camera he was ""100 per cent"" happy last November when Mr. Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The resulting campaign has seen Mr. Ford’s two main rivals throw a variety of attacks at the PC Leader, while also setting their sights on each other. The 65-year-old Ms. Crombie, who won her party’s leadership in December, 2023, has faced an uphill struggle to revive Ontario’s Liberals, often jokingly called the ""minivan party"" because they had just nine seats in the legislature after two disastrous elections. But she rejuvenated the party’s fundraising and insisted on tacking less to the left and more to the centre-right. She has been taking increasingly aggressive shots at Mr. Ford, calling his notion of a $60-billion to $120-billion tunnel under Highway 401 ""dumb"" and a ""fantasy"" in the televised leaders’ debate. She has also made fixing health care her main theme, promising everyone in Ontario access to a family doctor in four years and saying she’d spend $3-billion to do it. And she has pledged a broad-based tax cut – something Mr. Ford said he would do in 2018 but never delivered. From almost the moment she stepped into the role, the former mayor of Mississauga and former federal Liberal MP has faced a relentless campaign of PC Party attack ads. Mr. Ford routinely calls her the ""queen of the carbon tax,"" though she now says she disapproves of the federal fuel charge. Recently published opinion polls have shown her pulling ahead of the NDP in the popular vote, but still well behind Mr. Ford’s PCs. Her campaign, hurt by a rush to vet and nominate candidates, has hit some rough spots. She was forced to jettison her Oshawa candidate over an inflammatory and homophobic 2023 social-media post about the killing of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Ms. Crombie, who did not have a seat in the legislature, is running for one in Mississauga. In last week’s leaders’ debate, she pleaded with NDP voters to back the Liberals, saying she was the only leader who could beat Mr. Ford. Ms. Stiles dismissed it as a desperate ploy as the Liberals seek to regain the 12 seats required for official party status in the legislature. The Liberals are also running geographically targeted digital ads in close ridings, making the same appeal to NDP supporters thinking of switching. One Toronto NDP candidate, in Eglinton-Lawrence, had already dropped out on her own to support the Liberal there. Ms. Crombie has also tried to connect to voters by sharing her life story. Speaking to a Canadian Club business luncheon at the Royal York hotel last week, she pointed to rising homelessness under Mr. Ford and announced a commitment to fully fund mental health care. And she choked up as she recounted the alcoholism, homelessness and early death of her own estranged biological father in a Toronto shelter. ""My dad was living at Seaton House, not far from here,"" she said, pacing the stage. ""And he was dying. His addiction that had taken his family, and his home, and was now claiming his life."" At the same time last Thursday, Ms. Stiles was giving a pep talk to about 40 volunteers jammed into the storefront serving as headquarters for the NDP candidate in the Liberal-held east-end Toronto riding of Beaches-East York. The Newfoundland-born Ms. Stiles, 55, is Ontario’s Official Opposition Leader – but for how long depends on election night. The NDP had 28 seats at dissolution, compared to the Liberals’ nine. In 2022, the NDP captured about four times as many seats as the Liberals, despite the two parties tying in the popular vote with 24 per cent. But recent polls show the NDP trailing Ms. Crombie’s party. Ms. Stiles, a former union policy adviser and school trustee who was acclaimed to her current post in 2023, says her party is still running to win. She says the NDP is focusing on what she calls ""orange/blue"" ridings, in Niagara, and Southwestern and Northern Ontario – where she says her party is in head-to-head battles with the PCs. Liberal campaigners charge that Ms. Stiles, MPP for Toronto’s Davenport, is actually focused on saving existing NDP seats threatened by the inroads Mr. Ford has made through winning the endorsement of construction and skilled trades worker unions. The NDP accuses the Liberals of similarly focusing on its traditional toeholds. ""I think Bonnie Crombie and the Liberals have kind of given up the fight. Doug Ford quit as premier. I never give up. I will not stop fighting. I will not quit,"" Ms. Stiles tells reporters before hopping over the snowbanks on Danforth Avenue to climb back aboard her orange campaign bus. ""I am running to be the premier of this province."" Her party usually enjoys an advantage in attracting volunteers, including from its union supporters, that could help it get out its vote in what is expected to be a low-turnout election. While decrying Mr. Ford’s deals with ""insiders,"" her campaign has largely focused on trying to present Ms. Stiles as a trustworthy, down-to-earth leader who would fight to protect Ontario jobs from Mr. Trump while putting billions more into health care and schools. On housing, she has promised to get the government involved directly in building affordable homes and enforcing strict rent controls. She has also pledged to hand out monthly grocery-price rebate cheques for low- and middle-income families, and vowed to make the privately run and tolled Highway 407 free – without explaining how. With promises squarely aimed at voters’ wallets, both opposition leaders have in some ways borrowed from the playbook of Mr. Ford, who rarely misses a chance to crow about the licence-plate sticker fees he cancelled in 2022, or his distaste for road tolls. The 60-year-old PC Leader, who launched his hastily conceived 2018 campaign for his party’s leadership from his mother’s basement, is now on the verge of winning three majority governments in a row – which would make him the first Ontario premier to do so since fellow Tory Leslie Frost in 1959. After running the U.S. branch of the family label-printing business, Mr. Ford rose to prominence as a Toronto city councillor during the tumultuous mayoralty of his brother Rob Ford, who made global headlines a decade ago for erratic behaviour and alcohol and drug abuse, and died of cancer in 2016. After unsuccessfully taking over his ailing brother’s re-election run, Doug Ford soon turned his sights to provincial politics, when then-PC leader Patrick Brown was forced to resign in a scandal. Mr. Ford would lead the PCs to victory over then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne in 2018, and he would win again in 2022. While he has claimed he needed a snap election to secure a new mandate to deal with Mr. Trump, Mr. Ford and his advisers had been mulling an early election since at least last spring, when he announced hundreds of millions of dollars to speed up the introduction of beer sales in corner stores. In the fall, he laid more groundwork, announcing that he would send out $200 cheques to most taxpayers despite still running deficits. His campaign has been relentless in its focus on fighting the threatened tariffs and boosting the economy, including pledges to spend billions to cushion the blow for Ontario companies. Some seat projections based on polling data last week suggested he could win more than 90 of the legislature’s 124 seats, up from his current 79. Mike Schreiner, Leader of the Green Party of Ontario, is hoping to hang on to the party’s two seats. One common enemy all the campaigns have faced is the weather. Over the roar of traffic on a snowdrift-lined street in Etobicoke, Liberal candidate John Campbell says Mr. Ford’s snap election in February seems aimed at keeping people from voting at all. ""It’s hard to put up signs. It’s hard to make your way along sidewalks. People don’t want to have the door open,"" says the former city councillor, who is taking on PC cabinet minister Kinga Surma. ""It’s anti-democratic, really, to have it at the worst time of year.""

Poilievre's post-woke nati onalism,2025.0,"Forget about that crunchy apple he ate in an orchard once: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's hyper-nationalist rebranding, unveiled at his Canada First rally in Ottawa on Feb. 15, is pitch perfect. Or so Conservatives should hope. The biggest uncertainty - and threat - for any po - tential prime minister who's riding high in national polls is a lengthy wait for the writ to drop. Anything could go wrong during the interim. For Poilievre and the Conservatives, who've been unofficially campaigning for more than a year, many things have. Principally: U.S. President Donald Trump and his decision to play mean girl with our country, which stings all the more after a decade of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's divisive, woke rhetoric and claims that Canada is a genocidal post-national state. Even before Trump's tariff and annexation threats, Poilievre was faced with Liberals and left-wingers accusing him of being a ""maple MAGA"" or a ""mini MAGA"" or some starry-eyed fan and copycat of the so-called Orange Man. Any conservative talking point or promise of Poilievre's was no longer deemed ""conservative,"" but Trumpian. The comparisons held real potential to turn Canadian politics into a zero-sum game in favour of the Liberal party. It was from these equivalences that stemmed the notion that Poilievre is not the leader Canada needs to stare down - and negotiate our way through - the looming American threat. Poilievre's detractors have been frenzied with these attacks. How could Trump's wannabe sidekick save our country? Liberal leadership hopeful Chrystia Freeland couldn't resist, either: ""Pierre Poilievre is not the guy who can do it. He is maple syrup MAGA. All he wants to do is imitate Trump. And I don't think Canadians trust him to stand up to Trump,"" she said in a recent CTV interview. Well, Poilievre has now decisively proved that this is not the case. He is the one our country needs during this sovereignty crisis. ""We are mild mannered and made of steel. So let me be clear: We will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country,"" Poilievre avowed at his overfilled rally on Feb. 15. ""In the words of our great first prime minister, Conservatives will fight, and I quote, 'to give us a great, a united, a rich, an improving, a developing Canada - instead of making us a tributary to American laws, American railways, American bondage and American tolls.' That is the rich Conservative legacy to Canada. Deliberately resisting American annexation for hundreds of years. Now more than ever, we owe this country. We love this country and we will fight every day and every way to pass down to our kids the blessings we inherited from those who came before us,"" said Poilievre. More than once, Poilievre reminded the crowd that Canada's founding political party - the party of Confed - eration - is the Conservative party. He spoke of a vision for Canada where we are the richest nation, with the most self-reliant economy, on earth - with or without what Trudeau adorably calls an American friendship. He spoke of building monuments to honour the Fathers of Confederation and the Canadians who fought and died in Afghanistan - and new Criminal Code provisions to punish those who ""tear down or deface"" them. It was a lot. Heavy handed, at times. But so is Trump. And so were the failures of the Trudeau government that have led us to our current state - lacking a national identity, with a pitiful economy, and under threat from our closest ally. This moment of crisis in Canada calls for a new nationalism, and the one presented by Poilievre fits him like a tailored suit. The Liberals, by contrast, are pulling Canadian flags out of the back of their closets like a pair of wide-leg jeans from the '70s that are suddenly back in style. But they've put on 20 pounds and the zipper won't budge. We saw what regard they hold for our flag when they maintained it as a symbol of bigotry - and even fascism - both during and long after the trucker convoy came to Ottawa. They are no patriots. During Poilievre's speech, on the topic of life sentences for fentanyl traffickers, the Conservative leader said: ""I'm not doing this for him."" Him, of course, meaning President Trump, who has demanded Canada stem the flow of fentanyl across our shared border. He is doing it for Canada. ""For Canada first, always and forever,"" he said. We won't know, until future polls close, just how many Canadians believe him. Trudeau's post-nationalism is dead - and a postwoke nationalism is here to replace it, if we'll allow it.

"Sceptres alone in second place:   Campbell makes 22 stops, Compher nets winner as Toronto picks up its sixth straight victory",2025.0,"Jesse Compher one-timed a shot from between the faceoff circles to beat Minnesota's Maddie Rooney with the game-winning goal as the Toronto Sceptres beat the Frost, 2-1, Sunday to take over sole possession of second place in the Professional Women's Hockey League. The teams came into the game tied for second place with 29 points, five points behind league-leading Montreal and one ahead of fourth-place Boston. With the win, the Sceptres now have 32 points. The Sceptres won their sixth straight game and first over the Frost in three meetings. ""We've been on the road here for a little while, so at this point in our trip to grind one out, it feels good,"" Sceptres head coach Troy Ryan said. Toronto will end a four-game road swing on Tuesday in Montreal. Michela Cava put Minnesota in front with a power-play goal early in the first period. Dominique Petrie fed Cava with a short pass and the forward held the puck just outside the crease as Toronto netminder Kristen Campbell dropped to prevent a low shot. Cava then picked the top corner for a 1-0 lead. Toronto evened the game at 1-1 after Minnesota's Brooke McQuigge earned a five-minute major penalty and a game-misconduct for a dangerous check to the head with under eight minutes left in the second period. With a minute left in the power play, Toronto's Emma Maltais fired a wrist shot from the top of the slot that beat Rooney for her fourth goal of the season. ""They're a good team,"" Minnesota head coach Ken Klee said of the Sceptres. ""They play hard."" Since Toronto's win streak began Jan. 25, a 4-2 win over the New York Sirens, the Sceptres have scored on 48 per cent of their power-play opportunities. Campbell finished with 22 saves on 23 shots to earn her fifth win. Rooney had 21 saves on 23 shots and is now 7-4-1-1. ""I like that as a group, they found a way to win a hockey game - a pretty sloppy game,"" Ryan said. Toronto can move into first place with a regulation win over the Victoire in Montreal on Tuesday.

"Adam Zivo: Poilievre is right, give fentanyl traffickers life sentences",2025.0,"Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has said that, were he to form government, he would impose harsh imprisonment for fentanyl trafficking, including mandatory life sentences for major dealers. This is a laudable idea, even if his proposed legal mechanism for enacting these reforms is questionable. Opioids have killed tens of thousands of Canadians. As of 2024, 79 per cent of all accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths involved fentanyl, up from 39 per cent since 2016 when tracking of opioid-related deaths began. According to Health Canada, fentanyl was involved in roughly 80 per cent of overdose deaths last year. The opioid is roughly 50 times more potent than heroin, meaning that just a 2-mg dose, the physical equivalent of a few grains of sand, can be lethal to inexperienced users. Earlier this month, Poilievre proposed that traffickers caught with 20-mg or more of fentanyl be given 15 years in prison, while those caught with 40-mg or more be given mandatory life sentences of 25 years without the chance of parole. He compared selling illicit fentanyl to mass murder, and suggested that his proposed sentencing reforms would invoke Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects the right to life, liberty and security of the person. He told reporters two weeks ago: ""Here's how I interpret the Charter: that law-abiding people have the right to expect their children will not die in back alleys."" Excluding his Charter argument, this approach makes sense. Although Canada's fentanyl crisis has, to some extent, been a symptom of global forces beyond our control, our unsettlingly lax criminal justice system in general has greatly exacerbated the problem. Under the status quo, fentanyl traffickers are regularly given light sentences that are scandalously disproportionate to their crimes, and are let out on bail far too quickly and easily Canadian gangs pivoted to manufacturing fentanyl after China, facing international pressure, controlled the production and export of the opioid in 2019. They were so successful in this respect that, by 2021, they oversupplied the domestic market and crashed the drug's street price by roughly 30 per cent Yet, despite the rapidly deteriorating situation, the Liberals failed to adequately empower law enforcement to tackle fentanyl trafficking - something which could have been done, for example, by shifting the RCMP's resources away from provincial matters, such as highway patrol, to nationally-focused anti-drug policing. Instead, the feds narrowly focused on radical harm reduction (i.e. ""safer supply"" and supervised consumption sites) to the near-total exclusion of other solutions. Their failure to holistically address the overdose crisis, and address enforcement gaps, was mirrored by some provincial governments, most notably the B.C. NDP. In some cases, the federal government made fentanyl trafficking easier. This was epitomized by its support of B.C.'s disastrous drug decriminalization experiment, which permitted individuals to legally carry 2.5 grams (enough fentanyl to kill over 1,000 people) as well the passage of Bill C-75 in 2022, which eliminated certain minimum punishments for drug-related offenses and allowed greater use of conditional sentences for simple possession. The federal government does not micromanage sentencing lengths for drug crimes, and gives judges wide latitude to determine sentences based on a complex milieu of factors, including federal and provincial jurisprudence. Over the past decade,some judges throughout Canada have embraced a soft-hearted approach to sentencing. Not only are criminals given scandalously light punishments if they come from marginalized backgrounds, drug trafficking can be treated so unseriously that one wonders if any real accountability exists for traffickers at all. In B.C., the sentencing range for first time street-level trafficking is now typically 18-36 months, which, according to Pivot Legal Society (a drug-friendly human rights organization), is among the harshest sentencing ranges for low-level fentanyl trafficking in Canada. Meanwhile, a 2021 Supreme Court of Canada ruling R v. Parranto mentions a starting range of eight to fifteen years for those who oversee wholesale fentanyl trafficking operations, even though such individuals help move enough of the opioid to kill, at the very least, hundreds of thousands of Canadians (1kg of fentanyl, a moderate wholesale volume, contains 500,000 lethal doses). The case does, however, point out that starting ranges are non-binding, meaning these sentences can be decreased or increased based on a judges' discretion concerning an individual's circumstances. Some prosecutors, particularly in Ontario, have tried to impose harsher punishments on fentanyl traffickers by charging them with manslaughter, which can add a few extra years of jail time. However, this solution is rarely used, and limited to low-level traffickers, because establishing a causal link between a particular transaction and death is exceedingly difficult. There can be no justice for Canada's overdose victims when fentanyl traffickers face such disproportionately soft punishments for selling lethal poison. While the federal government's powers over criminal sentencing are limited, it has the capacity to establish harsher mandatory minimums, but has, for whatever reason, declined to exercise this authority here. Is it any wonder, then, that fentanyl superlabs are springing up throughout parts of this country like kudzu? Human behaviour is predictable: people react to disincentives, or the lack thereof. There is clearly an ethical case for new mandatory minimums: addicts are human beings, and their lives are jeopardized and grossly devalued when the state fails to adequately punish traffickers. By invoking the language of ""mass murder,"" Poilievre is tapping into the moral spirit of the preexisting movement to charge traffickers with manslaughter, while bypassing the associated legal challenges by using a different avenue of law. That being said, his invocation of Section 7 is unwise. Charter rights should be interpreted cautiously and narrowly, otherwise they risk being exploited for judicial activism - ?as demonstrated by a recent Ontario ruling which attempted to use Section 7 to force municipalities to permit open drug use in homeless shelters. By pushing for an expansive interpretation of the Charter, Poilievre may be missing the forest for the trees. Surely, there is a better alternative.

Harry Rakowski: Poilievre is the bulldog Canada needs to fight Trump,2025.0,"The election of Donald Trump has the risk of upending Canada's historic friendship with the United States. As Pierre Poilievre said the ""unprovoked attack on Canada's economy"" could ""turn a loyal friend into a resentful neighbour"". Vince Lombardi, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach, speaking on leadership, told a 1970 audience of business executives in Ohio that our test is ""whether man confuses the growth of wealth and power with the growth of spirit and character ... In this struggle there are no spectators, only players"". Canada needs to understand how to best play the game against the U.S. as we defend not only our sovereignty, but our values. There will be a price to be paid, but this is also an opportunity. In the short term, U.S. tariffs and trade barriers may lead to economic hardship and belt-tightening. But it would also force us to change the way we operate as a country, making us both more efficient and resilient. As Canadians, we have to change the inefficient way we have been governed without losing our moral compass. Trump only respects leaders who show toughness and can stand up to his bullying. He has little respect for Trudeau, and is unlikely to see either Mark Carney or Chrystia Freeland in a positive light. Some people have criticized Pierre Poilievre as being too much of a bulldog, but isn't that exactly the quality we need in a leader who has to vigorously fight to defend the threat to our sovereignty and our values? We can feel good about booing the U.S. national anthem, but it doesn't accomplish anything and isn't how Canada operates. We need to neither cheer nor boo and focus our energy on playing the game to the best of our ability and winning where we can. It is very likely that within the next few weeks a federal election will be called. For a brief period, we are likely to have Mark Carney as our first ever unelected Prime Minister, someone who doesn't have to disclose his previous financial interests, or the role that he played in advising the Trudeau government on its carbon tax and failed economic policy. He is intelligent and accomplished, but is he our man for the times? Does he have a team up to the task? One of our greatest negotiating cards is the fact that the U.S. needs to import over 4 million barrels of oil from us per day with few alternatives. Venezuela, touted as an alternative, only produces about 1 million barrels per day with little ability for its old infrastructure to greatly expand production in the near term. We need a leader and a team who can work with Alberta to leverage this asset. That will certainly not be Steven Guilbeault, our minister of the environment and climate and his party which has consistently dismissed Alberta while enjoying its tax revenue. We need to declare a national emergency to facilitate the permitting of energy production and construction of transportation options to deliver energy to non-US markets. Will this be done by the team that managed the Trans Mountain pipeline extension and turned a $4.5 billion budget into an exorbitant $34 billion costly final price because of unnecessary delays and ineffective management. We need a government that has the internal capability to not need to spend $11 million on consultants who gave us great programs such as ArriveCan. We need to grow our economy by promoting business development and job creation, not stifle it with red tape and excessive regulation. Public service levels have ballooned in the last nine years and currently cost over $60 billion - cuts need to be made that won't reduce important service levels. All government spending needs to be targeted to deal with current risks and future needs. Justin Trudeau's answer to any problem appears to be throwing money we don't have at it, and valuing form and posturing over substance. In April 2024, he raised the carbon tax. Just before Christmas, no doubt as a pre-election gimmick, he gave away $6.3 billion in tax breaks and rebates instead of keeping our powder dry to spend it supporting challenged sectors of our economy. He raised the capital gains tax causing innovators and start ups, essential for our future growth to flee the country. If Mark Carney didn't agree with these plans, where was his voice of dissent? Chrystia Freeland only dissented when she got wind that she was going to be demoted. We need a government that can support critical industries hurt by potential tariffs with funds that come from reining in too large government and excessive spending, rather than simply by more damaging taxation and unlimited deficits that fuel our already high costs of debt service. We need to decrease U.S. imports, particularly in replacing the $32 billion in agricultural imports with other friendlier suppliers, even if there is a higher price to be paid. We need to expand new markets for our mineral and forestry products as well. We need to increase our defence spending and focus on our northern border. We likely will need to buy submarines capable of travelling under the ice from Germany, a country who we refused to help when they were desperate for liquid natural gas imports from Canada, causing them to turn to Qatar. Will our moral compass be directed by Mélanie Joly, who, as our foreign minister, has yet to effectively speak out against Hamas and antisemitism, seemingly due to concerns she might upset the demographics of her riding? No government and no prime minister will be perfect or have a crystal ball to anticipate all that needs to be done to navigate the hoops we will have to jump through. We do, however, know who is unlikely to have the strong team capable of being up to the task. History of failure by our current weak team should teach us a damning lesson. We need to remind our former best friend and ally that we can be either a good friend or a formidable adversary. That strong message is best sent by a very experienced, if sometimes argumentative, politician rather than an long-résuméd, but elite banker.

Poilievre pivots from 'broken' to 'Canada first',2025.0,"Are the federal Conservatives flailing? In the span of a week, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has gone from his previous description of Canada as a country where ""everything is broken"" to basking in a sea of red and white, and an election-style speech asking supporters, staff and MPs: ""Who's ready to put Canada First?"" Days later, however, Poilievre was tacking further to the right. He held a press conference in Toronto Thursday in which he offered no comment about U.S. President Donald Trump's sellout of Ukraine (and he wasn't asked). He doubled down on the ""broken"" and the ""radical woke"" culture-war narrative that poisoned politics in the United States; peppered legitimate criticisms about his potential Liberal challenger with gross exaggerations, and took questions from only pre-approved media outlets, such as Rebel News and True North, and none from the mainstream English press. The narrowing of public opinion polls - an enormous reversal of an 18-month trend that had Conservatives leading by more than 20 per cent to now single digits - have Conservatives spooked. Several polls suggest that former Bank of Canada governor and current Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney would be a threat to Poilievre's efforts to become prime minister. A Carney-led Liberal party, according to the latest Leger poll, would be statistically tied in public opinion, and lead in Ontario, Atlantic Canada and Quebec which would, hypothetically, translate into a Liberal minority government. It's no wonder Poilievre is so focused on Carney. On Thursday alone, he mentioned Carney's name 48 times during his 27-minute press conference. But what's happened over the past few days is the public expression of the pulling and pushing of differing poles within the Conservative tent. On the one hand, there is the desire to respond to the threat of the moment: to Trump, his 51st-state musings, and his menacing tariffs. That was the Poilievre on display on Saturday, Feb. 15. Showing off his pride, Poilievre quoted from Conservative prime minister John A. Macdonald's famous speech in the Commons where he lobbied for more funding for the Pacific railway, a nation-building project that would tie Halifax to the Pacific Ocean. ""Conservatives will fight ... to give us a great, a united, a rich, an improving, a developing Canada instead of making us a tributary to American laws, American railways, American bondage, and American tolls,"" Poilievre said, to the cheering crowd. (Nevermind that the Conservatives currently don't seem fond of investing billions of dollars into a newly-announced high-speed-rail project that would tie Quebec City to Toronto.) Poilievre noted last Saturday that ""sometimes it does take a threat to remind us what we have, what we could lose."" He spoke of building the country up, and noted policies he has long championed - some of which recall Trump's own promises - more oil and gas development, lower taxes, scrapping environmental assessment rules and slashing spending on bureaucrats, consultants and foreign aid. But on Trump, Poilievre was specific. He called on Canada to respond to the threat with ""strength."" ""If they put tariffs on our steel and aluminum, I will put tariffs on their steel and aluminum. If they hit us with generalized tariffs, we will respond dollar for dollar,"" he said, echoing the position of Liberal leadership candidates. A trade war, Poilievre predicted, would weaken both the U.S. and Canada. But then he offered another way out of the (Trump-made) crisis: closer integration with Canada's southern neighbour. ""Option two,"" Poilievre said, ""we trade even more. And both our workers make more. Our consumers pay less. The resulting GDP boost allows Canada to further strengthen its border. And up our military spending to two per cent of GDP faster,"" he said, to large cheers from the crowd. That option did not find a fan in former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. Writing in the Globe and Mail this week, Harper said, ""our focus now should not be on pursuing a deeper economic and security partnership. At this stage, whatever comes next from the President, Canada must avoid further dependency on the United States."" But while Harper was telling Poilievre that he needed to adopt a different tact to respond to the American economic threat, the Conservative leader appears to have concluded he cannot win on a ballot question that involves negotiating with Trump. Instead, Poilievre pivoted back to his old strategy, ensuring the next election is fought on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's record. His message was retooled for the moment. ""Imagine if they (the Liberals) did this much damage before the tariffs, how dangerous they would be after tariffs?"" That strategy has already been so successful it led to Trudeau's resignation. If he needs to pretend that Carney was Trudeau's puppet master over the past five years, he will. Tying NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to the unpopular Trudeau government sunk that party's poll numbers. Now, the Conservatives hope it will demolish Carney, too. CAPTION: Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks in Ottawa at a Canada First rally on Feb. 15.

Geoff Russ: Poilievre's plan for Canadian prosperity is refreshing,2025.0,"Last Saturday in Ottawa, Pierre Poilievre delivered what many described as the most important speech of his life. For weeks, the Liberals have rapidly regained ground in the polls following Justin Trudeau's announcement that he was leaving politics. Amidst a Liberal leadership race that former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney seems to already have in the bag, the NDP vote is collapsing, with the governing Liberals being the main beneficiaries. Poilievre needed to make a splash to regain control of the narrative and reframe the election on his terms in the wake of Donald Trump's threats of economic warfare. For about an hour, the Conservative leader outlined his vision for Canada with more detail and vigour than ever before. The rather muted reaction to it among the Liberal party and its loyal cadre of boosters in the media is a good indication of the speech's success. As Conservatives gathered for Poilievre's speech, Trump was the obvious elephant in the room. Many in the audience were anticipating how, if he became prime minister, the Conservative leader would pledge to deal with the unfriendly American president. As expected, Poilievre promised to match Trump's tariffs on a dollar-for-dollar basis and ensure the Canadian economy would be protected when engaging with Trump. This is more or less the consensus view held among Canada's political parties. What was more interesting was Poilievre's offer to improve the Canadian economy from within. Notably, he promised the largest and most ""patriotic"" tax cut in the country's history, perfectly in line with his existing pledge of ""powerful paycheques"" for Canadians after years of inflation and rising tax burdens Restoring the ""promise of Canada"" was another big part of his speech and a way to assure Canadians, especially younger voters, that the possibility of social mobility in Canada is not yet extinct. The threat of Trump's economic warfare will still be one of the top issues in the upcoming election, but the affordability crisis plaguing younger Canadians has not abated. Housing costs remain the biggest reason for that crisis, with the price of renting and owning homes more dire than at any point in living memory. Within his speech, Poilievre reiterated his promise to slash the fees and red tape currently attached to homebuilding as part of his plan to boost the housing supply and help restore affordability. Having once planned to fight an election on Trudeau's carbon tax, Poilievre has kept affordability front and centre during his shift that began on Saturday. He also managed to retain the promise of eliminating the carbon tax, pouncing on the fact that Carney will retain carbon pricing as prime minister. Carney may have tried to assure Canadians that they will not have to pay for his reformed carbon pricing plan, but he deserves to be taken with a grain of salt. There is no world in which Carney's carbon pricing, that includes a proposed ""carbon tariff"" will not be felt by working- and middle-class Canadians. If the Liberal leadership frontrunner believes that the added emission costs borne by producers of steel and other products will not be passed down to consumers, his economic credentials should be called into question. On the other hand, its not clear how much he can be trusted. Carney has already pledged in English to use emergency powers to force major projects on the provinces while ruling it out when interviewed in Quebec media. Carney has also pledged to balance the budget in three years, but also stated that Canada needs to boost its spending on decarbonization from $20 billion per year to $80 billion. The budget deficit in the fall economic statement delivered in December was over $60 billion already. After almost a decade of striving to keep Canadian energy projects to a minimum, the Liberals have finally begun muttering about the necessity of building new east-west pipelines as a means of securing Canadian supply chains from American tariffs. Carney himself could not bring himself to voice a clear stance on the matter, saying that he supported the ""concept"" of new pipelines, whatever that really means. Even when his campaign finally released a wordy document meant to resemble a policy plan, it was noticeably devoid of specifics aside from generic pledges to review spending and ""invest"". As it stands, there is only one party represented in the House of Commons that stands unambiguously committed to actually building a new network of pipelines and export facilities for LNG and oil. As Poilievre himself said in his speech, if voters want Conservative policies, they will have to vote Conservative. Poilievre's speech should put to bed the narrative that he lacks policy specifics. For over a year, the Conservative party has had a 49 page policy declaration on their website, stuffed with ideas that can be viewed at any time. Along with Poilievre reiterating his pledge on pipelines, taxes, and housing, he also laid out his plan to build a new Arctic military base at Iqaluit and icebreakers to help patrol the polar region. There were far more policy specifics in Poilievre's speech related to policing and cultural policy, but it is clear what Canadians can expect from a Conservative government.

"Is the real Pierre Poilievre the one we saw on Flag Day, or the one we’ve known until now?:   The Conservative Leader spoke directly and forcefully, with fewer of his normal graceless jabs at opponents and cheesy slogans",2025.0,"The advance word on Pierre Poilievre’s big speech in Ottawa on Feb. 15 was that it would launch a major “rebranding” for the Conservative Leader and his party, part of a broader “pivot” in the wake of three signal political events: the resignation of Justin Trudeau, the repeal of the carbon tax promised by the leading candidates to replace him, and the sudden attack on Canada’s economy and political sovereignty by U.S. President Donald Trump. Sorry, did I say three events? There is a fourth, overshadowing all: the remarkable narrowing of the Conservative advantage in the national polls. Six weeks ago, the Conservatives led the Liberals by an average of 25 points. As of this week, the gap is in single digits, according to most polls. It isn’t just that the Conservative message needed retooling, with Mr. Trudeau and the carbon tax – the obsessive focus of Conservative attacks going back several years – either gone or going. It is that, in the wartime atmosphere Mr. Trump’s bizarre campaign to bend Canada into “51st state” servitude has created in the country, the air had rapidly gone out of the message, and the messenger. Parties coasting to victory don’t need to pivot. And leaders who have sealed the deal with the public don’t need to rebrand. It may have been obscured by the massive wave of public revulsion that drove Justin Trudeau from power, but Canadians do not have a great deal of use for Mr. Poilievre, either. His net favourability ratings have been negative (meaning more people viewed him unfavourably than favourably) since before he became leader. But in recent months, the gap has widened significantly. He isn’t as unpopular as Mr. Trudeau, but he is plenty unpopular. It isn’t hard to find the reasons for this. Mr. Poilievre’s attack-dog persona and endless supply of cheap shots, his arsenal of populist slogans, press-baiting, and appeals to ignorance and paranoia (World Economic Forum, anyone?) remind too many voters of Donald Trump, in tone if not in substance. As does the company he chooses to keep: from the dim-witted insurrectionists in the “freedom convoy” to the increasingly unhinged Jordan Peterson. The positioning may have succeeded in keeping potential People’s Party voters in the Conservative tent, but at the cost of raising doubts about Mr. Poilievre’s leadership among many other Conservative and Conservative-adjacent voters. Sure enough, with the imminent departure of Mr. Trudeau – and the arrival on the scene of superstar central banker Mark Carney – many of those voters have begun to drift into the Liberal camp. But it was the crisis ignited by Mr. Trump that really put Mr. Poilievre on the spot. His glib, trashtalking persona suddenly looked ill-suited to the seriousness of the times. Worse, his defence of the country, in the face of Mr. Trump’s threats and insults, sounded oddly muted, as if he were fearful of alienating that section of his base – anywhere between 40 and 50 per cent – that appears sympathetic to Mr. Trump. So the Conservative Leader had two main tasks in his Flag Day speech. One was to convey a sense of gravitas, rooted in a sober attention to the public’s priorities rather than attack lines and rhyming catchphrases. The other, slightly contradictory: to show a bit of fire in the belly for the country, a little in-your-face defiance of Mr. Trump, to match the public mood. Measured against these objectives, the speech has to be rated something of a success. Mr. Poilievre spoke directly and forcefully, with fewer of the graceless jabs at opponents or cheesy slogans with which his speeches are so often festooned. (There were still some – but fewer.) He stood behind a podium, wearing a suit, surrounded by masses of Canadian flags. The opening section was aimed straight at his perceived weakness: standing up to Mr. Trump. “Retaliation,” he said, “is only the beginning.” As indeed it was: Beyond tariffs – and the promise that any revenues raised would be returned in relief for workers and businesses affected and tax cuts for everyone else – there was the provocative suggestion that Canadian resources (he mentioned nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric power, as well as minerals, uranium and oil) might be used as bargaining chips, or as Mr. Poilievre preferred, “leverage.” He seemed to raise the prospect of withholding Canadian co-operation in NORAD and other continental defence arrangements. But he offered “our American friends” another option: Rather than “turn a loyal friend into a resentful neighbour,” they could “trade even more than we are now,” with the promise of further co-operation on issues of mutual concern: not just the border, defence spending, and fentanyl, but “terrorists, supersonic missiles and other threats.” All capped with this warning, inspired by John F. Kennedy’s inaugural: “We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect our sovereignty and independence.” This last is of particular significance. It is probably the more credible threat in a fight with the Americans: Not that we can do all that much to hurt you, but that we are prepared to endure whatever pain we must to prevail. What is more, it represents a shift in how Canada’s political leaders have tended to appeal to Canadians’ patriotism. We are more accustomed to being pitched in terms of what, to borrow from JFK again, our country can do for us. Here we were instead being asked to consider what we can do for our country. Yet is it not precisely those kinds of allegiances – the kind that entail some sort of sacrifice – that exert the strongest pull? The middle section was taken up with policy. Much of this was familiar – there was an attempt to insist the carbon tax, notwithstanding its imminent demise, was actually “an even bigger issue” on account of Mr. Trump’s tariffs and Mr. Carney’s alleged plans to revive it after the election – but given fresh urgency by the need “to stand on our own two feet and be masters of our economic destiny.” Thus previous Tory plans to cut taxes have been rebranded as “the biggest and most patriotic tax cut in Canadian history.” Cutting the sales tax on new homes; slashing corporate subsidies; repealing Liberal environmental regulations blamed for killing pipelines; fast-tracking resource development projects; these and other pre-existing Conservative policies have been repurposed as measures to reduce our dependence on the Americans. There were a few new-ish proposals: to encourage the provinces to eliminate their trade barriers, give them a cut of the resulting GDP growth (however calculated); to induce Indigenous leaders, likewise, to give their consent for resource projects, give them a cut of the corporate taxes on these; plus several measures (2,000 more Canadian Rangers, four heavy icebreakers, a new permanent Arctic military base) to defend Canada’s sovereignty over the North. In keeping with the patriotic theme there was a section full of proposals that promised to “end cancel culture and stop the war on our history.” Some were vague (“we will celebrate, rather than tearing down, our heroes”); some oddly specific (“The men and women of the Royal Canadian Navy will continue to sing the ”Heart of Oak”). (A note on patriotism, coveted political ground in these anxious times. Liberals object that Conservatives have no right to pose as patriots given their previous repeated insistence that “Canada is broken.” Conservatives respond that Liberals can hardly play the patriot card having spent the last nine years teaching Canadians to feel shame at the injustices committed in our name, notably against Indigenous people. But it is possible to be a patriot and still observe that your country has problems it needs to fix, and sins for which it needs to atone. It’s also possible to be a bit of a fool about it. However mismanaged it may have been, there is no reasonable sense in which Canada is “broken.” Neither should the historic failings of this, of all the countries on this blood-soaked planet, be taken to outweigh its manifest goodness, or the great things it has achieved, for its own citizens and the world’s.) Whatever you may think of any of these policies, taken as a whole they mark a return to what might be called normal conservatism. Fiscal discipline; low taxes; free trade and a “fierce free enterprise economy” national defence (though there was no specific pledge with regard to our NATO spending targets); pride in our history and traditions: These are reassuringly mainstream conservative themes. There was no mention of firing the Bank of Canada governor, or abolishing vaccine mandates, as in earlier Poilievre campaigns. Neither was there any of the coded, or not so coded, appeals to nativism and racism that have so disfigured the conservative movement in other countries. To the contrary, Mr. Poilievre went to some length to emphasize that “we will treat all our people – regardless of their race – as Canadians First without hyphens … Ours is a nationalism not based on bloodlines, birthplace or background … The goal is not to erase our differences but to bridge them.” Perhaps I am setting the bar too low, but if this is as far right as our main party of the right goes, we should be grateful to live in such a country. But here’s the thing. Mr. Poilievre may have said all the right things – or avoided saying the wrong things – in this speech. But there are still all those previous incidents and statements to bear in mind. His long-ago comments about residential-school survivors might be written off to the doctrinaire excesses of youth: not so his fevered advocacy, during the Conservative leadership race, that Canadians should invest their savings in bitcoin; his claims that a report on population movements during COVID, based on aggregated, anonymized data, meant the government was “spying on you everywhere” his vows to abolish the right to bail – effectively, the right to be presumed innocent – for certain offenders; his threats to invoke, for the first time federally, the notwithstanding clause. These and other incidents give rise to an uneasy sense that important norms and conventions are unsafe with Mr. Poilievre; that his ethics, as much as his judgment, are hostages to expedience. Nor is this all about the past. A couple of days before the speech, Mr. Poilievre gave an interview to the far-right Juno News outlet. Which, then, is the real Pierre Poilievre? The one we saw in the days and months and years before this latest rebranding? Or the one we saw on Flag Day? Was the previous incarnation just a feint, a means of locking up the base before pivoting to the centre? Or is this the feint, a play for moderate voters in the shadow of the general election? Oh well, you might say, who can tell what a politician truly believes: At least he’s playing to the right bandstand. But which bandstand will he be playing to six months from now? At the moment it’s good politics to distance himself from Trumpism. But supposing it became good politics to cozy up to it? It was a well-considered, wellwritten, well-delivered speech. But it will take a lot more than one speech to resolve all concerns about Mr. Poilievre’s fitness to serve as prime minister.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Coyne, Andrew",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 22, 2025",Conservatism; Political leadership; Carbon; Patriotism; Sovereignty; Environmental tax; Tariffs; Taxes; Political campaigns; Canadians; Economic development; Negative campaigning; Voters,,2025-02-22,The Globe and Mail
"'Disservice to democracy' - Windsor-Essex PC candidates dodge Ontario election debates, interviews",2025.0,"Essex County's Tory candidates are under fire for refusing to face their Ontario election rivals in public debate during the current campaign - and they and their party appear unwilling to say why. Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario headquarters will not acknowledge if it's an official policy or edict from PC Leader Doug Ford, and local candidates haven't responded to the Star's calls or messages. But the local practice of dodging debates and media questions appears to be a common theme for Tory candidates across Ontario. ""It is inherently less democratic,"" Jeffrey Dvorkin, a senior fellow at Massey College and former University of Toronto journalism program director, told the Star. ""This is about micromanaging a campaign, which Ford has done in the past, which is to say there'll be one message and it should always be from either the premier or a senior cabinet minister."" The Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce was forced to cancel its traditional all-candidates election debate this week for the ridings of Windsor West, Windsor-Tecumseh, and Essex due to lack of participation. Chamber president Ryan Donally said some parties had yet to choose candidates, while all candidates for one party declined to participate. A source with knowledge of the debates told the Star the party refusing to take part was the Progressive Conservatives. Parties eligible for the debate included the Liberals, NDP, Green Party, and PCs, who all have representation at Queen's Park. Incumbent PC candidates Anthony Leardi in Essex and Andrew Dowie in Windsor-Tecumseh, along with Windsor West candidate Tony Francis, did not respond to the Star's repeated requests for comments about why they refused to join the debate. Leardi and Francis also refused to talk to reporters following PC party Leader Doug Ford's campaign kickoff in Windsor. Dowie did talk to reporters that day, but has since ignored multiple interview requests from the Star, including for a phone interview or emailed responses to questions for an election riding profile Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario Leader Doug Ford greets local workers near the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor on Jan. 29, 2025, where he launched his re-election campaign. Dowie and Francis were also no-shows at a Windsor-Tecumseh and Windsor West candidates forum hosted Wednesday night by Emmanuel United Church. Other candidates running in those ridings showed up. Windsor's Ward 9 Coun. Kieran McKenzie, who watched that debate, took to social media to congratulate the candidates ""who had enough courage and respect for basic principles of democracy to show up."" He also wrote ""shame on you"" to those who didn't appear. They're not engaging, and it's sad McKenzie told the Star that it's ""incumbent"" on candidates to take all steps possible to communicate what they will do if elected. That includes attending debates and responding to media questions, he said. ""They need to talk,"" said McKenzie. ""That's what an election campaign is about, having that conversation with the public. They're not engaging, and it's sad. ""It's undemocratic, and hopefully they'll reconsider."" Tory candidates in several other cities have also refused media interview requests or debate invitations, including those in Timmins, Sudbury, Halton, Walkerton, Owen Sound, Durham, Sarnia-Lambton, and Brampton, among others. In response to the Star's request for comment, a PC party staffer identified only as Caitlin repeated verbatim a terse message sent to media in other cities who had similar questions about the lack of engagement. ""Ontario PC candidates will spend every day of the campaign at people's doors, speaking to voters about our plan to protect Ontario."" Caitlin did not respond to a follow-up email asking for more explanation, including how attending a debate would negate the ability to knock on doors, as candidates from other parties are doing. It's a similar strategy to one the Ontario Tories employed during the 2022 provincial election when they won a majority of seats at Queen's Park. It's a disservice to democracy ""Parties have always wanted more control over the message,"" said Dvorkin. ""The internet has made that more complicated. So in order to manage the message, political parties have limited who can speak on behalf of anybody. ""I think that's the downside of the digital culture. Even though it promises to let 1,000 opinions bloom, the effort to control the message is greater than ever."" During the current election campaign, Doug Ford has also started limiting his exposure to media scrutiny, allowing questions from only six reporters per press conference.

Crombie blames Ford for economic woes:   PC leader says he'll drop trade barriers between provinces,2025.0,"It's been seven years of bad luck in Ontario since Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives won power, charges Bonnie Crombie. In a speech Thursday to the Canadian Club at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel, the Liberal leader urged Ontarians to choose change in the Feb. 27 election. ""Since Doug Ford took office seven years ago, every single metric of economic success has gotten worse in Ontario. Business confidence is at the lowest it's been in a generation,"" Crombie told 250 attendees. Her comments came as Ford emerged from several days out of the public eye to campaign with Nova Scotia's Tory premier, Tim Houston, who also recently flouted his province's fixed-election date law to hold a snap vote. The Ontario PC leader said he and Houston agree it is time to finally eliminate interprovincial barriers as part of their fight against U.S. President Donald Trump's planned tariffs. ""We're facing the biggest threat to our economic security and independence as a country, we need to rise to the challenge. We need to match these words with bold actions. We need to strengthen the economic ties that bind our country together,"" Ford said in Milton. ""We can't afford decades of delays. We need to build, and we need to build now as we build up Canada's economy, we need to tear down internal trade barriers,"" he said, adding such bureaucracy and red tape costs the economy $200 billion annually. But Crombie, noting Ford has done little to reduce interprovincial trade barriers since forming government in 2018, argued the Tories' economic plan is failing. ""It's hard to attract investment to a province where workers are worried about gridlock, can't afford to buy a house and can't find a family doctor,"" she said, taking aim at Trump's musings about making Canada the 51st state. ""Ontario would be the fifth-poorest U.S. state if we were actually forced to join Donald Trump's U.S.A. We'd be down there with Alabama or Arkansas. Think about that. We've lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in manufacturing and construction especially,"" said Crombie. ""We have the second-highest unemployment rate in the country. Youth unemployment is the worst in all of Canada."" Crombie, whose campaign is focused on the fact that 2.5 million Ontarians don't have a family doctor, pledged to spend an additional $1 billion to ensure more mental health services are covered by OHIP. Tearfully recounting her own late father's struggles with alcohol addiction, she emphasized that mental health challenges also take a toll on the economy. ""We cannot sit back and hope things get better. As business leaders, you see the effects first hand. Productivity is directly related to mental health in your workforce,"" she told the Canadian Club. Meanwhile, Ford, in his first day of campaign events open to the media since Monday's televised debate, was asked about a controversial comment he made about capital punishment for violent criminals, as first reported by the Star last week. ""It was a joke and the 1,200 people in the room knew it was a joke,"" he said defensively about his reference to ""send 'em right to sparky,"" slang for the electric chair in a Jan. 29 speech at a London Police Service gala dinner. On Friday, Ford will make his second campaign trip to Washington to lobby state leaders at the National Governors Association winter conference about the harm that would come from Trump's tariffs on both sides of the border. ""The worst thing we could do is sit back and say, 'Let's not bother going down there, let's not communicate with our largest trading partner.' It is critical,"" the PC leader said. NDP Leader Marit Stiles cast her ballot at the Mary McCormick Recreation Centre on Thursday in her riding of Davenport. She urged people to take advantage of the advance polls that opened Thursday and will continue through Saturday.

Amy Hamm: Canada needs Poili evre's confident post-woke nationalism,2025.0,"Forget about that crunchy apple he ate in an orchard once: Pierre Poilievre's hyper-nationalist rebranding, unveiled at last weekend's Canada First Rally in Ottawa, is pitch perfect. Or so Conservatives should hope. The biggest uncertainty - and threat - for any potential prime minister who's riding high in national polls is a lengthy wait for the writ to drop. Anything could go wrong during the interim. For Poilievre and the Conservatives, who've been unofficially campaigning for more than a year, many things have. Principally: U.S. President Donald Trump and his decision to play Mean Girl with our country, which stings all the more after a decade of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's divisive, woke rhetoric and claims that Canada is a genocidal post-nation state. Even before Trump's tariff and annexation threats, Poilievre was faced with Liberals and left-wingers accusing him of being a ""Maple MAGA"" or a ""mini MAGA,"" or some starry-eyed fan and copy-cat of the so-called Orange Man. Any conservative talking point or promise of Poilievre's was no longer deemed ""conservative,"" but Trumpian. The comparisons held real potential to turn Canadian politics into a zero-sum game in favour of the Liberal party. It was from these equivalences which stemmed the notion that Poilievre is not the leader Canada needs to stare down - and negotiate our way through - the looming American threat. Poilievre's detractors have been frenzied with these attacks. How could Trump's wannabe sidekick save our country? Liberal leadership hopeful Chrystia Freeland couldn't resist, either: ""Pierre Poilievre is not the guy who can do it. He is maple syrup MAGA. All he wants to do is imitate Trump. And I don't think Canadians trust him to stand up to Trump,"" she said in a recent CTV interview Well, Poilievre has now decisively proved that this is not the case. He is the one our country needs during this sovereignty crisis. ""We are mild mannered and made of steel. So let me be clear: We will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country,"" Poilievre avowed at his overfilled rally this past Saturday. ""In the words of our great first prime minister, Conservatives will fight, and I quote, 'to give us a great, a united, a rich, an improving, a developing Canada - instead of making us a tributary to American laws, American railways, American bondage, and American tolls.' That is the rich Conservative legacy to Canada. Deliberately resisting American annexation for hundreds of years. Now more than ever: we owe this country, we love this country, and we will fight every day and every way to pass down to our kids the blessings we inherited from those who came before us,"" said Poilievre. More than once, Poilievre reminded the crowd that Canada's founding political party - the party of Confederation - is the Conservative Party. He spoke of a vision for Canada where we are the richest nation, with the most self-reliant economy, on Earth - with or without what Trudeau adorably calls an American friendship He spoke of building monuments to honour the Fathers of Confederation and the Canadians who fought and died in Afghanistan - and new criminal code provisions to punish those who ""tear down or deface"" them. It was a lot. Heavy handed, at times. But so is Trump. And so were the failures of the Trudeau government that have led us to our current state - lacking a national identity, with a pitiful economy, and under threat from our closest ally. This moment of crisis in Canada calls for a new nationalism, and the one presented by Poilievre fits him like a tailored suit. The Liberals, by contrast, are pulling Canadian flags out of the back of their closets like a pair of wide-leg jeans from the 70s that are suddenly back in style. But they've put on 20 pounds and the zipper won't budge. We saw what regard they hold for our flag when they maintained it as a symbol of bigotry - and even fascism - both during and long after the trucker convoy came to Ottawa. They are no patriots. During Poilievre's speech, on the topic of life sentences for fentanyl traffickers, the Conservative leader said: ""I'm not doing this for him."" Him, of course, meaning President Trump, who has demanded Canada stem the flow of fentanyl across our shared border. He is doing it for Canada. ""For Canada first, always and forever,"" he said. We won't know, until future polls close, just how many Canadians believe him. Trudeau's post-nationalism is dead - and a post-woke nationalism is here to replace it, if we'll allow it.

Poilievre more focused on cheering Canada than booing the U.S,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said he will be more focused on cheering team Canada than booing the U.S. national anthem when both countries' hockey teams face off on the ice for the 4 Nations final game on Thursday evening. The tournament - which brought together players from Canada, the U.S., Finland and Sweden - will see Canada and the U.S. compete for the second time amid an increasingly tense relationship between both countries due to threats of tariffs and annexation from the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be unable to attend the finals in person but that he would be watching and cheering on his country's team, adding that if ""Governor Trudeau would like to join us, he would be most welcome."" A spokesperson for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not say where exactly he would be watching the game, but confirmed he would be in Canada to watch it - not in the U.S. The final game will be taking place in Boston starting at 8 p.m. Last Saturday, the U.S. team beat the Canadians 3-1 in Montreal. Ahead of the game, hockey fans loudly booed the U.S. national anthem before passionately belting out their best rendition of O Canada. Poilievre was at the game in Montreal with his family. Asked on Thursday if he thought Canadians should be booing the U.S. anthem during sports events, he didn't endorse the idea. ""I would focus on cheering on Canadians. I want Canadians to win,"" he said during a news conference in Toronto. ""I enjoyed the game. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the outcome."" Poilievre, who attended Saturday's face-off with his wife Anaida and his three-year old son Cruz, who was attending his first hockey game, joked that his retirement plan is for his son to become an NHL hockey player so ""we wanted to get him started early on that."" Poilievre then reminded Canadians to direct their anger in a more targeted way. ""I would just encourage everyone to remember that our disagreement is not with the American people, it's with the American president's unjustified threats of tariffs,"" he told reporters. ""Let's focus on building our own country up,"" he added. U.S. Vice President JD Vance, speaking on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference, had a less diplomatic message in response to Canadians booing his country's national anthem. Speaking to the U.S. hockey team, Vance said ""we'd like you to kick their asses again, because you don't boo the United States of America."" ""And to Canada, if you guys don't win, the tariffs are even higher,"" he added. ""No, I'm kidding. That's the president's decision."" In an interview with the National Post, U.S. Congressman Tim Kennedy, who represents the district of Buffalo, New York, said Canadians booing his country's anthem is ""sad"" and he wished ""it wouldn't be happening"" but said he understands why they are so angry. ""It is an emotional reaction to what the President of the United States is doing to harm our relationship with Canada,"" he said. Kennedy, one of many Democrats who is pushing back against Trump's threats of tariffs, noted that the Buffalo Sabres will usually play both the U.S. and Canadian national anthems before every home game, whether their opponent is Canadian or not. He said Buffalo's hockey team does it ""out of respect for our Canadian friends and neighbours, and we're going to continue to do that."" Kennedy also said there are in his view many more Americans that ""cherish"" their relationship with their northern neighbours and are rejecting Trump's ""nonsensical approach"" which consists of threatening new tariffs on Canada every few days. ""Hopefully, Canadians will recognize that we're still the same friends.""

Stephen Harper: The preservation of Canada's existence must be our highest objective,2025.0,"I am frequently asked what to make of President Trump's intentions towards Canada and what we are to do about them. On the former, I do not know, and I suspect there is no way of really knowing. On the latter, however, Canada must have a plan. The facts are clear: President Trump was prepared, on a pretence, to jettison the almost entirely tariff-free trade that has defined the Canadian-American economic relationship for three and a half decades. He appeared prepared to even discard the trade agreement that he signed in his first term. Then, equally on a pretence, he cancelled that plan for 30 days. We do not know what the plan is after that, or if there is one. I suggest that there are four clear lessons for Canada. First, we must be calm in the face of Mr. Trump's threats. We must wait until it becomes crystal-clear what the President will do before acting ourselves. We should also remember that there is no significant body of public opinion in the United States calling for comprehensive trade action against Canada. Such action would hurt many Americans. Second, we should have contingencies for any possible scenario, including the worst. These must be prepared well in advance. There should be no debate, for example, over whether we would retaliate in the face of tariffs. It is true that retaliation is a poor choice, but, in the event of a trade war, we are left with only bad choices. Thus, our measures need to be carefully calibrated, with clear objectives in mind. But the worst possible response is no response at all, as that would lead to one-way economic flows from Canada to the United States. Third, we should not offer unilateral concessions. Concessions will simply be pocketed, and the demands will be ratcheted up. Make a concession only when we know what we are getting in return. That is the simple stuff. There is, however, a fourth, more troubling lesson, to take from all of this. It is the general perspective that the President has repeatedly articulated about our country. It is one that goes well beyond his understandable hostility to our current government. Rather than seeing the U.S. relationship with Canada as its most profitable, most reciprocal, and most secure in the world, the President views it as a drain on America. He believes that Canada's economic activity could take place in the United States and should move there. And he believes that Canadian sovereignty is undesirable. I certainly do not share that view of our relationship. I have repeatedly said that Canada's alliance, partnership, and friendship with the United States is one of our country's greatest assets. However, given a contrary American perspective, our focus now should not be on pursuing a deeper economic and security partnership. At this stage, whatever comes next from the President, Canada must avoid further dependency on the United States. I say this because the preservation of Canada's existence must be our highest objective. I do not assume that such a belief is universal, particularly if the cost is high. But it should be, and we need leaders who share that belief, who oppose the woke denigration of Canada, and who are prepared to see this fight through to victory. Our distinct history, identity, and cultures are worth preserving. The current situation thus presents great risk, but also considerable opportunity. We can use this moment to make Canada a proud and serious country once again. This is a chance for us to develop a long-term agenda to become an internationally competitive economy. That would mean big changes, not just in government policy, but also in our economic structures and business culture. We must break down interprovincial trade barriers, open internal markets, lower taxes, reduce subsidies, thin regulation, get our resources out of the ground, build export-oriented infrastructure, and make it a national mission to diversify our external markets. My government created a global network of free-trade agreements. It is well past time for Canada to take advantage of the possibilities that were created over a decade ago. If we choose this path, we will become stronger. But if we respond to this turmoil with a Canadian version of Trumpian protectionism, our country will weaken. Beyond the necessary retaliatory measures, enhanced protections and subsidies for Canadian business, even temporarily, only increase damage. Such policies would mean the adjustment to new economic realities would be delayed. Our balance sheets would be weakened further at the moment when we most need them to be stronger. Even worse would be continuing down the path of Davos elitism. Our competitiveness agenda must be focused on opportunities and incomes for working Canadian families, not just the economic one per cent. The elitist priorities of Canada's current leaders in monetary policy, deficits, immigration, climate, and many other areas have already fuelled inflation, doubled housing costs, and created the worst growth in the G7. Avoiding economic elitism is especially important when it comes to the re-engineering of our energy economy. Like it or not, alternatives to fossil fuels - nuclear power excepted - are not economical, reliable, or viable at scale. There is no guarantee they will become so. That is why they have been massively subsidized for the last decade. In contrast, fossil fuels will remain immensely profitable business for the foreseeable future. It is economic malpractice to ignore this fact. Canada's best route to quickly turning around the downward trajectory of our economy is the responsible development of our energy resources. This was true in the recession of the 1980s and during the global financial crisis, and it remains equally true today. We must also be what every sovereign nation should be: responsible for the protection of our citizens from crime and the maintenance of our own national security. Yes, our border is a shared responsibility with the United States. But beyond those lines, we must reinvigorate our military and invest in the full range of capabilities necessary for the defence of Canada's land, seas, and sky. We should aspire to depend on no one for this work. We should remain a partner of the United States, yes, but also be capable of independent action. Finally, we must avoid indulging in our worst instincts. Bashing the United States or baiting President Trump, however emotionally satisfying, is beneath us. We must show respect and maintain a long-term perspective. But so too must we approach the coming negotiations with steely professionalism and quiet self-confidence. These are dark days, but they will pass. Let us see this challenge as the opportunity for Canada to embark on a voyage of urgent national renewal.

"Doug Ford defends sponsoring Fox News interview with Trump, Musk as way to reach Americans:   The PC Leader, who is travelling back to Washington on Friday, says the multimillion-dollar ad campaign is ‘extremely effective’",2025.0,"Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford is defending his multimillion-dollar ad campaign airing on U.S. networks, including sponsoring Fox News host Sean Hannity’s interview with Donald Trump and Elon Musk, as a way to inform Americans about the impact that tariffs on Canadian goods will have on the U.S. economy. However, Mr. Ford would not reveal how much his government is spending on the ad buy, expected to be in the tens of millions, even as he said taxpayers have the right to know. The PC Leader suggested members of the public and media could file a freedom-of-information request to find out the cost. ""I’ve never had a bigger bang for our buck, when we’re in a fight for our lives, when we’re in a fight for the people’s jobs behind me, to get the message out that we’re close allies,"" Mr. Ford said Thursday at a campaign stop at a manufacturing facility in Milton, Ont. Mr. Ford was responding to a report in The Globe and Mail that revealed the Ontario government sponsored Tuesday night’s Hannity , one of the highest-rated U.S. cable news shows, which aired a prerecorded interview with the U.S. President and Mr. Musk, the tech entrepreneur who leads the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. ""This program is brought to you by Ontario, Canada, your trusted economic partner,"" the ad said, accompanied by an ""Ontario Canada"" logo with a maple leaf. It was followed by an Ontario government commercial that showcases the strong economic ties between the province and the U.S. Ontario launched the ad campaign late last year. Mr. Ford’s spokesperson, Grace Lee, said the Hannity sponsorship is part of the province’s original deal with Fox and that no new money is being spent during the current election campaign, which will see Ontarians go to the polls on Feb. 27. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose across-the-board 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian goods, as well as 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, all the while musing about making Canada the 51st state – a proposition that has been repudiated by Canadian elected officials across the political spectrum. Ontario’s opposition parties slammed Mr. Ford’s ads as wasteful and accused him of trying to distract from his own record during the campaign. They also criticized his recent trip to Washington, saying he didn’t achieve meaningful results. Mr. Ford said Thursday his government’s advertisements are also airing on several other networks, including CNN and CNBC, and have been seen by hundreds of millions of people. ""Those ads are extremely effective,"" he said. ""We have to tell the Canadian story. We have to tell the American friends – and they are our friends and they are our allies – that without Canada, there’s going to be inflation. A Trump tariff on Canada is a tax on Americans. Simple."" The PC Leader, who called the election almost 1½ years early, is running a campaign centred on protecting the province from Mr. Trump’s tariff threats. He travelled to Washington last week to meet with U.S. lawmakers, and he was joined by other premiers in meeting with two senior Trump officials at the White House. However, one of them – Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff James Blair – said on X after the meeting that officials ""never agreed that Canada would not be the 51st state."" Asked about Mr. Blair’s statement, Mr. Ford said he reiterated Canada’s sovereignty in all of his meetings. ""I think I’ve been pretty clear when I was down there and here, Canada will never ever be the 51st state and Canada is not for sale and it will never be for sale."" Mr. Ford is set to travel back to Washington on Friday, as is Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston, for a meeting of the National Governors Association. He said the trip is crucial for communication and relationship-building. ""The worst thing we could do is sit back and say, ‘Let’s not bother going down there. Let’s not communicate with our largest trading partner,‘"" Mr. Ford said.

"Is the real Pierre Poilievre the one we saw on Flag Day, or the one we’ve known until now?:   The Conservative Leader spoke directly and forcefully, with fewer of his normal graceless jabs at opponents and cheesy slogans",2025.0,"The advance word on Pierre Poilievre’s big speech in Ottawa on Feb. 15 was that it would launch a major ""rebranding"" for the Conservative Leader and his party, part of a broader ""pivot"" in the wake of three signal political events: the resignation of Justin Trudeau, the repeal of the carbon tax promised by the leading candidates to replace him, and the sudden attack on Canada’s economy and political sovereignty by U.S. president Donald Trump. Sorry, did I say three events? There is a fourth, overshadowing all: the remarkable narrowing of the Conservative advantage in the national polls. Six weeks ago, the Conservatives led the Liberals by an average of 25 points. As of this week, the gap is in single digits, according to most polls. It isn’t just that the Conservative message needed retooling, with Mr. Trudeau and the carbon tax – the obsessive focus of Conservative attacks going back several years – either gone or going. It is that, in the wartime atmosphere Mr. Trump’s bizarre campaign to bend Canada into ""51st state"" servitude has created in the country, the air had rapidly gone out of the message, and the messenger. Parties coasting to victory don’t need to pivot. And leaders who have sealed the deal with the public don’t need to rebrand. It may have been obscured by the massive wave of public revulsion that drove Justin Trudeau from power, but Canadians do not have a great deal of use for Mr. Poilievre, either. His net favourability ratings have been negative (meaning more people viewed him unfavourably than favourably) since before he became leader. But in recent months, the gap has widened significantly. He isn’t as unpopular as Mr. Trudeau, but he is plenty unpopular. It isn’t hard to find the reasons for this. Mr. Poilievre’s attack-dog persona and endless supply of cheap shots, his arsenal of populist slogans, press-baiting, and appeals to ignorance and paranoia (World Economic Forum, anyone?) remind too many voters of Donald Trump, in tone if not in substance. As does the company he chooses to keep: from the dim-witted insurrectionists in the ""Freedom Convoy"" to the increasingly unhinged Jordan Peterson. The positioning may have succeeded in keeping potential People’s Party voters in the Conservative tent, but at the cost of raising doubts about Mr. Poilievre’s leadership among many other Conservative and Conservative-adjacent voters. Sure enough, with the imminent departure of Mr. Trudeau – and the arrival on the scene of superstar central banker Mark Carney – many of those voters have begun to drift into the Liberal camp. But it was the crisis ignited by Mr. Trump that really put Mr. Poilievre on the spot. His glib, trash-talking persona suddenly looked ill-suited to the seriousness of the times. Worse, his defence of the country, in the face of Mr. Trump’s threats and insults, sounded oddly muted, as if he were fearful of alienating that section of his base – anywhere between 40 and 50 per cent – that appears sympathetic to Mr. Trump. So the Conservative Leader had two main tasks in his Flag Day speech. One was to convey a sense of gravitas, rooted in a sober attention to the public’s priorities rather than attack lines and rhyming catchphrases. The other, slightly contradictory: to show a bit of fire in the belly for the country, a little in-your-face defiance of Mr. Trump, to match the public mood. Measured against these objectives, the speech has to be rated something of a success. Mr. Poilievre spoke directly and forcefully, with fewer of the graceless jabs at opponents or cheesy slogans with which his speeches are so often festooned. (There were still some – but fewer.) He stood behind a podium, wearing a suit, surrounded by masses of Canadian flags. The opening section was aimed straight at his perceived weakness: standing up to Mr. Trump. ""Retaliation,"" he said, ""is only the beginning."" As indeed it was: Beyond tariffs – and the promise that any revenues raised would be returned in relief for workers and businesses affected and tax cuts for everyone else – there was the provocative suggestion that Canadian resources (he mentioned nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric power, as well as minerals, uranium and oil) might be used as bargaining chips, or as Mr. Poilievre preferred, ""leverage."" He seemed to raise the prospect of withholding Canadian co-operation in NORAD and other continental defence arrangements. But he offered ""our American friends"" another option: Rather than ""turn a loyal friend into a resentful neighbour,"" they could ""trade even more than we are now,"" with the promise of further co-operation on issues of mutual concern: not just the border, defence spending, and fentanyl, but ""terrorists, supersonic missiles and other threats."" All capped with this warning, inspired by John F. Kennedy’s inaugural: ""We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect our sovereignty and independence."" This last is of particular significance. It is probably the more credible threat in a fight with the Americans: Not that we can do all that much to hurt you, but that we are prepared to endure whatever pain we must to prevail. What is more, it represents a shift in how Canada’s political leaders have tended to appeal to Canadians’ patriotism. We are more accustomed to being pitched in terms of what, to borrow from JFK again, our country can do for us. Here we were instead being asked to consider what we can do for our country. Yet is it not precisely those kinds of allegiances – the kind that entail some sort of sacrifice – that exert the strongest pull? The middle section was taken up with policy. Much of this was familiar – there was an attempt to insist the carbon tax, notwithstanding its imminent demise, was actually ""an even bigger issue"" on account of Mr. Trump’s tariffs and Mr. Carney’s alleged plans to revive it after the election – but given fresh urgency by the need ""to stand on our own two feet and be masters of our economic destiny."" Thus previous Tory plans to cut taxes have been rebranded as ""the biggest and most patriotic tax cut in Canadian history."" Cutting the sales tax on new homes; slashing corporate subsidies; repealing Liberal environmental regulations blamed for killing pipelines; fast-tracking resource development projects; these and other pre-existing Conservative policies have been repurposed as measures to reduce our dependence on the Americans. There were a few new-ish proposals: to encourage the provinces to eliminate their trade barriers, give them a cut of the resulting GDP growth (however calculated); to induce Indigenous leaders, likewise, to give their consent for resource projects, give them a cut of the corporate taxes on these; plus several measures (2,000 more Canadians Rangers, four heavy icebreakers, a new permanent arctic military base) to defend Canada’s sovereignty over the North. In keeping with the patriotic theme there was a section full of proposals that promised to ""end cancel culture and stop the war on our history."" Some were vague (""we will celebrate, rather than tearing down, our heroes""); some oddly specific (""The men and women of the Royal Canadian Navy will continue to sing the ""Heart of Oak""). (A note on patriotism, coveted political ground in these anxious times. Liberals object that Conservatives have no right to pose as patriots given their previous repeated insistence that ""Canada is broken."" Conservatives respond that Liberals can hardly play the patriot card having spent the last nine years teaching Canadians to feel shame at the injustices committed in our name, notably against Indigenous people. But it is possible to be a patriot and still observe that your country has problems it needs to fix, and sins for which it needs to atone. It’s also possible to be a bit of a fool about it. However mismanaged it may have been, there is no reasonable sense in which Canada is ""broken."" Neither should the historic failings of this, of all the countries on this blood-soaked planet, be taken to outweigh its manifest goodness, or the great things it has achieved, for its own citizens and the world’s.) Whatever you may think of any of these policies, taken as a whole they mark a return to what might be called normal conservatism. Fiscal discipline; low taxes; free trade and a ""fierce free enterprise economy""; national defence (though there was no specific pledge with regard to our NATO spending targets); pride in our history and traditions: These are reassuringly mainstream conservative themes. There was no mention of firing the Bank of Canada governor, or abolishing vaccine mandates, as in earlier Poilievre campaigns. Neither was there any of the coded, or not so coded, appeals to nativism and racism that have so disfigured the conservative movement in other countries. To the contrary, Mr. Poilievre went to some length to emphasize that ""we will treat all our people – regardless of their race – as Canadians First without hyphens … Ours is a nationalism not based on bloodlines, birthplace or background … The goal is not to erase our differences but to bridge them."" Perhaps I am setting the bar too low, but if this is as far right as our main party of the right goes, we should be grateful to live in such a country. But here’s the thing. Mr. Poilievre may have said all the right things – or avoided saying the wrong things – in this speech. But there are still all those previous incidents and statements to bear in mind. His long-ago comments about residential-school survivors might be written off to the doctrinaire excesses of youth: not so his fevered advocacy, during the Conservative leadership race, that Canadians should invest their savings in Bitcoin; his claims that a report on population movements during COVID, based on aggregated, anonymized data, meant the government was ""spying on you everywhere""; his vows to abolish the right to bail – effectively, the right to be presumed innocent – for certain offenders; his threats to invoke, for the first time federally, the notwithstanding clause. These and other incidents give rise to an uneasy sense that important norms and conventions are unsafe with Mr. Poilievre; that his ethics, as much as his judgment, are hostages to expedience. Nor is this all about the past. A couple of days before the speech, Mr. Poilievre gave an interview to the far-right Juno News outlet. Which, then, is the real Pierre Poilievre? The one we saw in the days and months and years before this latest rebranding? Or the one we saw on Flag Day? Was the previous incarnation just a feint, a means of locking up the base before pivoting to the centre? Or is this the feint, a play for moderate voters in the shadow of the general election? Oh well, you might say, who can tell what a politician truly believes: At least he’s playing to the right bandstand. But which bandstand will he be playing to six months from now? At the moment it’s good politics to distance himself from Trumpism. But supposing it became good politics to cozy up to it? It was a well-considered, well-written, well-delivered speech. But it will take a lot more than one speech to resolve all concerns about Mr. Poilievre’s fitness to serve as prime minister.

"Loblaw fourth-quarter profit dips on PC Optimum charge:   Retailer sees surge in people participating in loyalty program, redeeming points as shoppers look to save money",2025.0,"Canada’s largest retailer is seeing a surge in people participating in its loyalty program and redeeming points, as shoppers continue to look for ways to offset higher grocery prices. The trend contributed to a dip in fourth-quarter profits for Loblaw Cos. Inc. L-T, as the company recorded a one-time non-cash charge related to its PC Optimum loyalty program. Loblaw has revalued its liability related to outstanding points held by members amid growing participation. On Thursday, the Brampton, Ont.-based retailer reported net earnings available to common shareholders fell to $462-million or $1.52 in diluted earnings per common share in the quarter ended Dec. 28, 2024, compared to $541-million or $1.72 per share in the same period the prior year. Excluding the charge related to the loyalty program and other adjustments, adjusted net earnings available to common shareholders grew to $669-million or $2.20 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $630-million or $2 per share in the prior year. Loblaw has also benefited from the increase in discount shopping in recent years, as inflation has pushed more Canadians to seek ways to stretch their budgets. Loblaw already has a higher percentage of discount stores in its network compared to some competitors, and the company is planning to open more as it aggressively courts price-sensitive customers. Last year, the retailer converted 38 of its regular grocery locations to discount banners. On Wednesday, ahead of its earnings report, the company announced that it plans to increase its focus on the discount business in the year ahead – opening more No Frills and Maxi stores. In total, Loblaw announced that of the 80 new grocery and pharmacy locations it will open this year, 50 will be discount grocery stores. That plan is a step up from the pace of store openings last year, when the company opened 52 new grocery and drugstores in total. Loblaw is also continuing to invest in expanding its health services business in the year ahead, with plans to open 100 new ""pharmacy care clinics,"" locations that look like small medical clinics within drugstores. These locations have consultation rooms for pharmacists to administer vaccines and provide advice to visitors, as the scope of conditions pharmacists are permitted to address expands in some provinces. Last year, the company opened 78 new pharmacy care clinics. This part of the business is contributing to drugstore same-store sales growth – an important metric that tracks increases in sales not attributable to new store openings. At Loblaw-owned drugstores, including Shoppers Drug Mart, same-store sales grew by 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, but within that result, pharmacy and healthcare services grew by 6.3 per cent. That offset a 3.1-per-cent dip in sales in the front of the stores, Loblaw has decided to stop selling some electronics products. The results were also affected by the Canada Post strike late last year, and lower sales of food and household items in the drugstores. At Loblaw’s grocery stores, same-store sales grew by 2.5 per cent in the quarter. The results were positively affected by a timing shift, with the Thanksgiving holiday occurring later in 2024 than it did the previous year, meaning the fourth quarter included more pre-holiday shopping days than in 2023. Excluding that shift, sales growth was roughly 1.5 per cent. In total, fourth-quarter revenue grew by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period the prior year, to $14.9-billion. E-commerce sales grew by 18.4 per cent in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Loblaw’s revenue increased by 2.5 per cent to approximately $61-billion. Net earnings available to common shareholders grew to nearly $2.2-billion or $6.99 in diluted earnings per share, compared to nearly $2.1-billion or $6.52 per share in fiscal 2023. On an adjusted basis, earnings were up 6.3 per cent for the year, to more than $2.6-billion or $8.55 in diluted earnings per share.

"Ford got in front of Trump problem early, unlike Poilievre",2025.0,"With anti-Trump feeling sweeping the nation, every Canadian politician opposes the U.S. president's menacing plan to take over Canada. But Donald Trump's brazen aggression has created a bedevilling problem for federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford. Both Poilievre and Ford - who have enjoyed popularity beyond their own hardcore conservative bases, racking up huge support in vote-rich Ontario - now have a serious Trump problem. Politically, both men are very in tune with Trump, and have said nice things about his policies over the years - things that appealed to their conservative supporters and didn't attract much broader attention. But, starting early last December, Trump's threats to make Canada the 51st state have overturned that applecart, leaving the two conservative leaders suddenly navigating very slippery political tightropes. Poilievre, in particular, has been slow to grasp and adjust to the new Trump-created dynamic. Reluctant to abandon his successful strategy focused on attacking the carbon tax, the Conservative leader was restrained in his early reaction to the Trump threats, mostly stating without much emotion or fanfare that Canada would not become the 51st state. By late December, Poilievre was still comfortable associating himself with Trump, telling the Times of London that he could rebuild Canada's relationship with Trump through a shared ""warrior culture, not a woke culture."" Poilievre's subdued response - along with questions about how effective his sullen, smart-alecky jabs would be against a nuclear-armed, would-be dictator - have turned his rock-solid lead in the polls to jelly. A number of polls now have Poilievre in a close race against the unelected Mark Carney, who hasn't even secured the Liberal leadership yet, but who has been clear and unequivocal in his opposition to the U.S. ""bully."" So, while Carney denigrates Trump as a bully, Poilievre has elevated Trump to ""warrior"" status. Finally, at an Ottawa rally last weekend, Poilievre tried to distance himself from Trump, vowing to ""pay any price"" to protect Canada's sovereignty. But even this reset has some clear Trumpian vibes to it. Realizing his old slogan ""Canada is broken"" isn't quite right now that Canadians have become fiercely patriotic, Poilievre has adopted the new slogan ""Canada First"" - which bears an uncanny resemblance to Trump's long-time slogan ""America First."" The Conservative leader is surely aware of that resemblance, as well as the vile connections of the ""America First"" slogan, which became widely associated with the Ku Klux Klan and antisemitism before the Second World War. Poilievre also sounded very Trumpian this month when he stressed that he planned to cover the costs of a new military base he wants to build in Canada's north by using a payment method recently showcased by Trump - cutting foreign aid. Presumably, these Trump-style flourishes are meant to reassure Poilievre's pro-Trump followers that nothing has really changed, even as he ramps up his ""pay any price"" rhetoric to satisfy ordinary Canadians. Ford has a similar Trump problem, but he got out in front of it. He quickly donned his ""Canada is Not for Sale"" cap, talked tough about blocking U.S. liquor sales in Ontario and briefly threatened to shred Ontario's $100-million contract with Elon Musk, the mega-billionaire who (along with his four-year-old son) appears to be running the Oval Office. Ford's fondness for Trump was exposed briefly this month when a video surfaced in which the PC leader privately describes himself as ""one hundred per cent"" happy about Trump's re-election, until the president ""pulled out the knife."" Ford's premature election call may save him. Although completely unnecessary and hugely costly, it looks like it will enable him to lock in a new mandate next week before Ontarians fully grasp his long-time enthusiasm for the American megalomaniac who now looms ominously at our southern border. Poilievre has proved less agile. And with a federal election still a couple of months away, his Trump problem will have more time to metastasize.

Poilievre still holds best hand but bad beat possible,2025.0,"In poker, we’d call this a “tell.” Last weekend, the federal Conservative party threw a pre-election Hail Mary to stall the upward momentum the federal Liberal party has demonstrated since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decided to step down. Using National Flag of Canada Day as a backdrop, Tory Leader Pierre Poilievre unveiled a fairly detailed “Canada First” policy that is, for all intents and purposes, the party’s platform for the next election, which could come as soon as the end of next month. Canada First is, at first examination, a fairly impressive array of pledges, some new and some from announcements made over the last year. It’s also a tell. If you want to know how worried the Tories are about their sliding support, you don’t have to look any further than the decision to release its campaign platform before the campaign actually begins. In fairness, unveiling the platform now is not necessarily a bad move for the Tories given that we are definitely going to have an election in a little more than a month. Still, it does confirm they are worried about where the pre-election polling numbers are going. So what does Canada First entail? In no particular order: a pledge to apply tariffs on a dollar-for-dollar basis to combat U.S. tariffs; promote new oil and gas pipelines; fast-track federal environmental approval of all critical mineral projects in northern Ontario; establish a permanent military base in Iqaluit and strengthen defences along U.S. border; remove inter-provincial trade barriers and introduce national standards for professional licensing; impose life-sentences on fentanyl “kingpins”; remove the GST on new homes under $1 million; create a tax reform task force. There isn’t much entirely new in Canada First. Planks such as inter-provincial trade barriers, tariffs, removing GST on new homes, strengthening border security and support for new critical mineral and pipeline projects are regular placeholders in the medley of Poilievre’s greatest policy hits. Others — particularly the war on fentanyl suppliers and the northern military base — were unveiled just prior to the Canada First rally in Ottawa. There are also some planks that suggest, despite growing disaffection in this country with what’s happening in the United States right now, Poilievre is going to continue parroting some Trumpian talking points. One Canada First plank promises to “end cancel culture and stop the war on our history.” Poilievre will do this by erecting a monument to Canadians who fought in Afghanistan and restoring screened images of Terry Fox to passports. Taken together, Canada First is entirely consistent with the tack Poilievre was on prior to the trade war with the U.S. and Justin Trudeau’s resignation. Which is to say, it’s not likely to serve as a catalyst for restoring Tory support, which has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. All that leaves Poilievre face to face with a much different electoral challenge than he faced just a few weeks ago. In most elections, veteran political strategists know that when the so-called winds of change begin to blow through the electorate, there is little an incumbent governing party can do to stay in power. This provides ample opportunities for an opposition party to seize power simply on the weakness of the governing party’s brand. The winds of change also represent the equivalent of a free pass for opposition parties looking to take down a government. “We may not be better but, hey, we’re not the other guys” is tried and true messaging in an election that is yours to lose. The only thing that can derail this time-honoured phenomenon is if the governing party transitions to a new leader who embraces change as their brand. This is the “political unicorn” theory of leadership: a new face that is seen as competent and compelling but sufficiently divorced from the old leader and party brand that they can offer themselves up as an agent of change. A unicorn like this doesn’t appear very often. The Manitoba Progressive Conservatives could not save themselves in the 2023 vote by dumping uber-unpopular Brian Pallister and embracing Heather Stefanson. Kim Campbell could not save the Progressive Conservatives in 1993 after she took over from a beleaguered Brian Mulroney. In short, there are many more examples of new leaders failing to save their parties than there are of new leaders breathing life into a party on its deathbed. Where does that leave Mark Carney, the acknowledged front-runner in the leadership race? He cannot be considered a bona fide unicorn, but polls suggest he might have unicorn-adjacent potential. National polls released this week show the Conservative lead has dwindled from the high to mid-20s to single digits. Seat projections have also shifted, with many now showing the Tories getting precariously close to 172 seats, the number needed for a majority. For the Liberals to fully derail the Conservative party’s march to victory, they would still need to win back an enormous amount of support. And they’d have to do that while managing the transition to a new leader. A complete Liberal recovery, which would imply a historic Conservative collapse, remains the long-shot scenario in the upcoming election. It’s just not quite as long a shot as it used to be. dan.lett@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Dan Lett","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Lett, Dan",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 20, 2025",Military bases; Conservatism; Critical minerals; Political leadership; Fentanyl; Political parties; Tariffs,,2025-02-20,Winnipeg Free Press
PC candidates trade barbs in first debate:   Candidates at odds over future of party,2025.0,"BRANDON — Two competing visions for the future of Manitoba’s Official Opposition party clashed hard Wednesday evening as Progressive Conservative leadership candidates Wally Daudrich and Obby Khan traded insults during the party’s first leadership debate in front of a crowd of nearly 100 strong. Khan, a former provincial cabinet minister and pro football player, tried to paint himself as a “big tent” leader who could bring Conservatives of all stripes together to win another eight seats in vote-rich Winnipeg come the next provincial election. He expressed a belief in core values of faith, family, fiscal responsibility, less government, less bureaucracy, community and freedom. “These are conservative values. We might not agree on everything for how far it goes,” Khan said, “but the thesis still brings us under one big tent together.” While arguing that he has already had experience winning elections and knows what it takes to win, he questioned Daudrich’s apparent lack of interest in running for an open seat in the upcoming Transcona byelection that was announced earlier this week. “There is a seat in Transcona right now. It’s still open if he wants it. Will he take that chance?” Khan asked. Daudrich, the Churchill-based businessman, refused to take the bait, and instead publicly questioned whether Khan was conservative enough to be leader of the PC Party. He also bolstered his conservative resumé by stating that he had campaigned with Stephen Harper, but that his opponent had campaigned with former Manitoba Liberal leader Rana Bokhari and former Ontario Liberal leader Kathleen Wynne. In one particularly testy point in the debate while speaking of homelessness and drug addiction in Manitoba, and the need for compassion, Khan referenced news reports earlier this month in which Daudrich reportedly joked to a group of party members that he could reduce homelessness in Manitoba’s capital by letting polar bears loose downtown. “You know who said that? This guy. So will he today say sorry for making that bad joke?” Khan asked. Daudrich did not offer an apology, and instead doubled down on his comments, saying that he sometimes uses humour to make a point, and that Churchill’s mayor and council do not tolerate homelessness in his community. “Yes, I made a joke to make a point, and that it’s a decision for a government, whether it’s Winnipeg, Thompson or Brandon. If you’re going to have homeless people, that’s your choice. That’s the choice in the mirror. You’re going to have people that get into trouble, absolutely, but you can deal with it in a humane and immediate fashion.” Among the major topics of the night was how the Tories could find their way back into power, and how the party would address the fact that the province is essentially broke. Both candidates said it was time to essentially abandon the current health-care model and look outside Manitoba for an alternative that could function better in this province, and blamed the NDP for essentially bankrupting Manitoba. Both candidates praised Alberta Premier Danielle Smith for her efforts to fix health care in that province. In another testy moment between the two candidates, Khan questioned Daudrich’s integrity for accepting the endorsement of an Alberta company that he claimed appeared to be a shell company that had no board of directors and “no connection with Manitoba.” “Who is this third-party organization? How do you know them? Is this not outside interference? And most importantly, how did they obtain personal emails of PC Party members?” Khan demanded. Daudrich countered that he has been writing articles in the Western Standard paper about his project, a saltwater port that would “make Manitoba the wheelhouse of Western Canada in economies,” and that clearly the Alberta company liked his idea. Increasingly angry comments back and forth between the candidates on the topic — with Khan demanding an answer to his question — prompted Daudrich to question Khan’s conservative values to prevent the destruction of the party. “I’m not going to apologize because somebody likes what I want to do here in Manitoba,” Daudrich said. “One of the reasons I jumped into this race is because we need a real conservative in this race. If we don’t have a real conservative, guess what? Our party’s going to splinter. “There’s people waiting in the wings to start a new party because they don’t think that this party’s conservative now. So I’m standing up for conservative values. Whether or not you agree with me or accept the answer, that’s too bad.” Daudrich said he would reorganize the Progressive Conservative Party in Manitoba like a profitable, successful business. And as the premier of the province he would plan to do the same with Manitoba’s economy, so that the government could afford better health care and infrastructure. “I don’t want to just balance the budget. I want to grow the economy so much that we can afford the best health care and the best infrastructure and the best public safety program in Canada,” Daudrich said in his closing statement. “I don’t want to just ensure that the economy is vibrant enough that Manitobans don’t want to move away. I want an economy that is so successful that Manitobans want to move home.” mgoerzen@brandonsun.com Bluesky: @mattgoerzen.bsky.social Credit: Matt Goerzen","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winni peg, Man.","Goerzen, Matt",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 20, 2025",Professional football; Leadership; Homeless people; Elections,,2025-02-20,Winnipeg Free Press
"A Liberal comeback could be in the making:   With Trumpians supporting Poilievre, the Tories might face a tougher path",2025.0,"In these times of upheaval, are we witnessing the greatest political turnaround in Canadian history? If the Liberals were to come from being marooned at 20-plus points behind the Conservatives and in just four months elect a new leader who wins a general election, it would merit that extraordinary distinction. They haven’t even selected their new leader yet, but several polls have them closing in on Pierre Poilievre’s populist Conservatives. Nanos has them only seven points behind, Ekos only five. With Mark Carney specified as leader, Angus Reid has them within just three; Leger, a dead heat. With that kind of momentum the unthinkable is possible. The party deemed dead at Christmas could be returned to power by early spring. The surge might just be a blip, a temporary leap brought on by the departure of loathed leader Justin Trudeau and enthusiasm for likely replacement Mr. Carney, enthusiasm which might not last. The ideologically hardened Mr. Poilievre is a powerhouse campaigner, a rapier-tongued combatant. An avalanche of attack ads will paint the new Liberal leader in old and unsightly party colours. When the dust settles, much of the Conservative lead could be restored. But the Liberals have reason to be cautiously hopeful.

That change – from preoccupation with domestic woes to a fixation on a foreign threat – significantly favours them. To counter Donald Trump’s 51st-state threat, polls show Canadians prefer Mr. Carney over the Conservative Leader. Small wonder. Mr. Carney is a global economist of stature. He helped steered Canada through the great financial crisis of 2008. He helped steer Britain through the challenge of Brexit. “My strength,” he said in a recent podcast, “is that I know how the world works.” While Mr. Carney is tailormade for the times, Mr. Poilievre, a parochial pugilist, is not. He has spent much of his time as Opposition Leader running down the country. With the premium now on pride and patriotism, it’s precisely the wrong image. A couple of months ago he was a great fit. Now he’s a misfit. Angus Reid has the Poilievre unfavourability rating at 56, the favourability at only 37. Last weekend Mr. Poilievre attempted a reset, staging a popular rally in which he wrapped himself in the Canadian flag, singing the praises of the nation. Besides losing his big juicy target that was Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Poilievre has also lost his most effective issue. The carbon tax was hurting the Liberals badly. Given the Trump menace it’s no longer such a big deal. Mr. Carney has vowed to replace the tax anyway.

'Where has he been?' Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie calls out PC Leader Doug Ford on campaign trail,2025.0,"Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie called out Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford Wednesday for his relatively low profile during the snap election campaign triggered last month. ""Where has he been? He called an early, unnecessary election at the cost of $189 million and he's been absent for 50 per cent of it,"" she said during a campaign stop in Clarence-Rockland, a riding most recently held by the PCs, but which has been Liberal in the past. ""Show your face and be accountable for your record."" Ford, like other leaders, has taken part in two leaders' debates over the past week, the first focused on Northern Ontario and the second one a province-wide debate. Unlike other leaders, the PC leader did not participate in post-debate question and answer sessions. As of Wednesday, Ford had not taken questions on the campaign trail in nine days. His party says his plans will be released in the coming days. Locally, PC candidates have also turned down interviews and debates. In response to a question about candidate participation in debates and interviews, the PC campaign released this statement: ""Ontario PC candidates will spend every day of the campaign at people's doors, speaking to voters about our plan to protect Ontario."" Crombie made the comments after being asked about past social media posts by some Liberal candidates, including Ottawa Centre's Thomas Simpson, who tweeted what some reports say appears to have been a joke about consent in 2012. Crombie said Simpson had apologized. ""He was a young man and he understands that is not appropriate and not tolerated and he has completely apologized, withdrawn his statements, and he's made those apologies."" ""They want to sling mud. If Doug Ford has something to say to me, he should have the balls to say it to my face,"" Crombie said. Crombie also appealed to voters who would normally vote NDP to vote Liberal this time. ""This only way to change the government is to vote Ontario Liberal. We have the momentum and we have the wind in our sails."" Her comments came on the heels of a new Postmedia-Leger poll that shows Ford's PCs maintaining a strong 20-point lead over Crombie's Liberals, which are in second place. The poll showed 48 per cent of Ontarians would cast a ballot for the PCs, while 28 per cent would vote for the Liberals. Sixteen per cent say they would vote for the New Democrats led by Marit Stiles. Eighteen per cent of Ontarians polled said their impression of Ford had improved since the start of the election, while 16 per cent of Ontarians said their impression of Crombie had improved since the election call, a three-point improvement over the past week. Forty-five per cent of respondents said Ford was the best leader to defend Ontario's interests from trade and economic sanctions. Ford said he triggered the early election because he needed a strong mandate to take on economic threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. And 33 per cent of respondents said they were satisfied with the PC government and Ford and would vote for them again. With just over a week to go until the Feb. 27 election, there are still details of all the major parties' platforms to be released. Improving health care and getting primary care to all Ontario residents is a key plank of Crombie's campaign. That includes recruiting and training 3,100 doctors, including foreign-trained doctors. The plan includes doubling residency programs, increasing compensation and reducing their administrative burden. She said the plan would cost around $3 billion. Crombie said her plan included incentivizing doctors to locate in certain parts of the province. She said she would expand existing programs under the PC government. She also said better pay and support would help retain family physicians. All three major parties say they have plans to close primary care gaps in the province. The PC government announced a four-year plan with Dr. Jane Philpott just before the election call. An estimated 2.5 million Ontario residents do not have family doctors - a number expected to increase without significant intervention.

Poilievre pitches naturalresource revamp to offset Trump; Economy,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre pledged to build an ""east-west economy"" with oil and gas pipelines stretching from Alberta to the Maritime provinces as part of a sweeping plan to respond to United States tariff threats. In a major speech Saturday, the opposition leader aimed to persuade Canadians that he's the best candidate to lead the country in a looming tariff war with its largest trading partner. He promised to hit back hard against any levies imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, while revamping the natural-resources sector to fortify the country's economy against threats from its southern neighbour. ""We have to be prepared for the worst,"" Poilievre told a crowd of nearly 2,000 supporters in Ottawa, many draped in red and white. ""We can no longer depend on the Americans alone for our trade. We can no longer think of them as our backup defence. These threats, my friends, are a wake-up call."" The ""Canada First"" rally reflects a marked shift for the Conservative leader and electoral frontrunner as his party's polling numbers waver. Just weeks ago, Poilievre's Conservatives were on track for a landslide victory in an election expected in the coming months. But his polling lead has narrowed as Trump ramped up verbal attacks on Canada's economy and sovereignty, pushing Canadians to focus more on the U.S. relationship than domestic issues. Poilievre centred his message Saturday on retaliating against any tariffs, strengthening the border, cutting taxes, boosting energy production and avoiding a possible recession should U.S.-Canada trade disputes escalate. ""We will respond dollar for dollar"" on all tariffs applied to Canadian goods, the leader warned. ""We will make sure Americans know they will be paying the tariffs they impose on us."" Poilievre made wide-ranging promises on energy policy, natural-resource extraction, military protection and interprovincial trade. He pledged to abolish trade barriers between provinces and construct pipelines from Alberta's oil sands to the the eastern province of New Brunswick. He vowed to repeal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's environmental assessment law within the first 60 days of entering office in order to greenlight pipeline projects, permit mines and port expansions to overseas markets. He also promised to bolster military spending, deploying thousands of rangers to the borders, buying new icebreaker ships for the navy and establishing Canada's first Arctic military base since the Cold War. At one point, he spoke directly to the American administration, spelling out two options: one, it could carry out an unprovoked attack on Canada's economy, forcing U.S. consumers to pay more and weakening both countries; or two, the nations could trade even more, with the resulting economic boost allowing Canada to further strengthen its military and border. ""You have your grievances with us, we have ours with you, but I would ask you this question: which other country would you rather have as your neighbour? And if Canada is not your friend, who is?"" he said. The party leader also reiterated domestic policies on Saturday, pledging again to repeal Canada's consumer carbon tax and promising new efforts to eliminate the flow of fentanyl in the country - something Trump has fixated on in his calls for Canada to secure its border. ""I'm not doing this for him,"" Poilievre said. ""I'm doing this so that there's not one more Canadian parent that has to collapse on the ground on learning their child has died in a back alley somewhere.""

Trump win altered appeal of Poilievre,2025.0,"Donald Trump may be ruining Pierre Poilievre's plans to become prime minister. It's a remarkable thing. For months and months, the Conservative Party of Canada looked to be a shoo-in for forming government. They clamoured for an early election, looking to make good on that promise. They wanted a ""carbon-tax"" election that would at once be a referendum on Justin Trudeau's leadership and an electoral reckoning as Canadians continue to struggle through an affordability crisis. Then Trudeau announced he was resigning, and Trump won the U.S. presidential election, immediately taking aim at the Canada's economy and sovereignty. Now things are radically different. Ahead of the U.S. election, there was speculation that the Liberals preferred Trump to win. He'd be the perfect foil for them - a belligerent, far-right beast the red side could suit up to take on. It was a cynical notion, never expressed, at least not publicly, by any serious Liberal. But it was plausible. Now that Trump has won, Liberal fortunes are looking up. It helps that, amidst that seismic shift, Trudeau has made plans to step aside. Writing in the Walrus, Philippe Fournier says polls with Mark Carney at the helm of the Liberal party, and the country, show a reshaped electoral landscape, including a better outlook for the governing side in Quebec, a must-win province. A Nanos poll even finds Canadians prefer Carney to Poilievre by a full 14 points when it comes to negotiating with Trump. With Trudeau on his way out, it's as if a weight has been lifted. Fournier and others point out that it's not unusual to see a new leader get a short-lived bump in the polls, as John Turner did in 1984 and Kim Campbell did in 1993; we know how things turned out for them. But the Liberals are nonetheless up, and that's the best news they've had in some time. Thanks, Trump. It's not the only effect Trump is having on Canadian electoral politics, which appear to be twofold. On the one hand, Trump's extremist politics - his authoritarian posture, his sweeping takeover of the executive branch, his culture war-mongering - may be casting a shadow on Poilievre, an association that the Conservative leader, for all his newly found disagreement with the president, would surely prefer to avoid. Whereas Poilievre previously seemed to represent a challenge to a status quo that has failed so many Canadians, voters may be now looking at him with suspicion by way of lumping him together with Trump. It's not hard for Poilievre's opponents to offer a nudge, maybe with lips pursed, as they face voters and ask ""Really? This guy? Doesn't he remind you, well, of ... you know who?"" Trump's attacks on the Canadian economy and our sovereignty have also unleashed a wave of nationalism coupled with the defiance of a country scorned. Even with Trudeau on his way out, the Liberals now enjoy an implicit wartime incumbent advantage - don't change a horse in midstream and all that. It's a similar kind of boost to that which George W. Bush enjoyed during his presidency in the aftermath of 9/11 and the war in Iraq (a criminal blunder that, in 2004, was still somehow popular enough for Bush's electoral purposes). The Liberals could have a chance at having it both ways. It boggles the mind that it's even possible, but they might even manage a win. The Grits with a new leader may now represent stability while shedding the baggage that accompanies Trudeau. They can go to voters and claim to be the steady hand on the tiller while asking them to forget that, just a few months ago, their incumbent leader was so unpopular no one wanted him anywhere near the thing. It's an old cliché to say that politics is about timing and events. But it's an old cliché for a reason, and that reason is politics is about timing and events. The Liberals haven't locked in a fourth election win, not by any stretch. But if they can sell Poilievre as Trump-adjacent and run on the need to keep steady in life during wartime, they might have what could only be described as a stunning turnaround - and have a real shot.

"Has Poilievre changed his message to supporters?:   Some say context has changed, but Tory leader has been consiste nt",2025.0,"Pivot? What pivot? That was the message Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre projected Saturday at a patriotic, campaign-style rally that framed the Conservatives as the party of ""Canada First."" In doing so, Poilievre rejected the notion that his party was officially abandoning its relentless crusade against the ""carbon tax"" to take on the more immediate threat posed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, he suggested protecting Canada's interests has been his core message all along. ""You know, before the tariff threats, we were talking about a carbon tax election. But now with these threats, I have to concede, I've had to reflect on whether it is a top of mind issue. And after much reflection, I have concluded that the carbon tax will be an even bigger issue in the coming election than we thought,"" Poilievre said in a rousing, hour-long speech that also served as his clearest condemnation of Trump's expansionist and protectionist agenda. He took particular aim at Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney, who has pledged to scrap Ottawa's consumer carbon price-and-rebate-scheme and replace it with green incentives, maintain the carbon pricing system for heavy emitters, and put in place a ""carbon border adjustment,"" or a tariff on imports from countries that have weaker climate change policies. ""If he wins, Canada loses. But Canadians will win. And we will do it with a new 'bring it home' economic plan,"" Poilievre said. ""We will bring home our jobs, investment and companies and break our dependence on the United States. We will unleash a fierce, free enterprise economy to bring home control of our economic future from outside forces. We will stand on our own two feet, be masters of our own destiny, and be in charge of our own future."" Whether you believe that Poilievre's call to ""bring it home"" - a slogan he favoured long before Trump's return to the White House - is proof that the Conservative leader has always been prepared for this political moment seems to be a matter of opinion. ""I do not observe it to be a pivot at all. I think the context has changed, but the content has not,"" said Kate Harrison, vice-chair of Summa Strategies, of the changes Trump has injected into Canada's political discourse. ""One of the criticisms that (Poilievre) has faced is that he's maybe dancing around the issue of Trump or not willing to take him on. I think this weekend should really put that criticism to rest."" Harrison said the root of Poilievre's message has always been about ""economic sovereignty,"" and that his recent messaging is simply a ""continuation and amplification of the same content."" Mitch Heimpel, director of policy at Enterprise Canada and a former Conservative staffer, said that in that vein, ""the fundamental core of the message for the last three years has been that the country needs to be built up."" One area in which Poilievre most strongly reflected that belief on Saturday was his focus on energy independence, Heimpel said. In his speech, Poilievre said he would ""incentivize Indigenous leaders"" to build projects ""by letting companies pay a share of their federal corporate taxes to local First Nations."" He vowed, within 60 days of forming government, to repeal the Liberals' controversial Impact Assessment Act, which assesses resource and infrastructure projects based on environmental, social or economic impacts. He promised to replace the law with one that would see projects more quickly approved and, among other commitments, pledged to green light an East-West pipeline and federal permits for northern Ontario's Ring of Fire. ""This tariff crisis has proven Conservatives were right also about natural resources. And that's why we need a plan to bring home production to this country,"" Poilievre told hundreds of his red-and-white-clad supporters. The framing that Poilievre has been right all along doesn't ring true for everyone. ""There's clearly been a pivot,"" said Scott Reid, a political analyst and communications director to former prime minister Paul Martin. ""No longer can they be content that it is enough to be opposed to Trudeau and be the beneficiaries of the time for a change. Trump and Carney have changed everything."" (While there are five candidates vying to replace Justin Trudeau, some polls have suggested a Carney win would make a decisive Conservative victory less certain.) ""They can deny it's a pivot, but they may as well deny the ground they're walking on or the sky above,"" said Reid, who noted that explicit references to a broken Canada were absent from Poilievre's remarks. ""It's plainly obvious that they're making some changes, and, by the way, that's probably very sensible. It's probably research-rooted,"" Reid said. Harrison said that nevertheless, it makes ""little sense"" for the Conservatives to retreat from their carbon tax messaging, given that it is a ""foundational piece of our economic and investment environment."" But Reid said that an emerging consensus from political leaders of all stripes on issues like Trump's threats, energy infrastructure, the consumer carbon price and the capital gains tax hike, could change the ballot box question for the Conservatives - and everyone else. ""I think one of the really interesting questions about where we are headed at the federal political level and this next stretch of time is if there is this sudden and stunning consensus on all the big issues - if everyone agrees more or less about everything, then all that's left for voters to decide is who do they trust most to implement that agenda?"" Reid said.

Tasha Kheiriddin: Poilievre's Canada First gravitas is exactly what the Tories need,2025.0,"Did he or didn't he? Did former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper really offer then Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney the job of finance minister in 2012? Carney, now running for the Liberal Party leadership, made the claim twice in the past few days, in English on CBC and in French on Radio Canada in response to whether he'd ever been offered ""other positions in the past,"" a leading question if there ever was one; if it wasn't cleverly planted by Carney's campaign, I'll eat my computer. The response? So far - crickets from Harper, though his former director of communications Dimitri Soudas gave a statement to CBC News that ""Mark Carney is not telling the whole story, and prime minister Harper certainly does not support Mr. Carney in any way."" Anaida Poilievre, wife of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and a former political staffer, lashed out on X at Carney for taking credit for the work of late finance minister Jim Flaherty. The Conservative rumour mill spun that Harper had offered the post to ""flush out"" Carney as a closet Liberal. But without a straight denial, the statement hangs in the air, waiting to be deployed in debates, interviews and election ads. Why does it matter? Because it strikes at Conservative vulnerability: centrist switch voters. Voters who could vote Conservative or Liberal, depending on how they feel about a particular issue or leader - voters who can't stomach Trudeau and would elect a llama instead. Voters who might think, hmm, if Carney was good enough for Harper, maybe we'll give him a look. That's a problem, and the Conservatives know it. With an election call possibly less than a month away, and Carney the likely Liberal leader, the Conservatives desperately want to tie him to Trudeau They are talking up the advice Carney had given to Trudeau over the years, his love of carbon taxes, and that he is ""Just Like Justin."" But it's not substance the Conservatives should pay attention to: it's style. One of golden rules of communications is the Mehrabian When a person communicates feelings, three elements determine whether you like the message they're sending. Words account for 7 per cent, tone of voice for 38 per cent, and facial expression for 55 per cent. Politics is a game of emotions. In the current atmosphere, where the prevalent emotion is fear and anger at U.S. President Donald Trump, whoever can convey reassurance has an advantage. That's where Carney, a former central banker not known for smarm and flash, has a leg up on Trudeau. But Carney can also play that card with Poilievre, who has spent the last two years gleefully attacking not just the federal government, but a range of Canadian institutions, including the Bank of Canada, municipal governments and the media. Poilievre's infamous apple-munching video, in which he turned the tables on a hapless reporter, got high praise from Elon Musk - not exactly an endorsement to trumpet right now. That style worked when voters were angry at our government. But now, Canadians need the state to protect them, not a leader who would tear it down. Instead, Conservatives should do more of what they started this weekend. Their Canada First rally in Ottawa, held on Flag Day, hit all the right notes of patriotism and policy. Poilievre didn't completely abandon his ""Axe the Tax"" messaging, but he segued to a larger vision that included specific commitments on defence and tariffs. More importantly, he displayed gravitas, transitioning from opposition to proposition, and most importantly, distanced himself stylistically from Trump's disparaging tone. The Conservative base still felt he was their champion, but more centrist voters could feel he was in their corner too. In the next election, Canadians will be looking for a statesman. Whoever they feel is the better one could tip the balance - and top the polls. National Post Tasha Kheiriddin is Postmedia's national politics columnist.

Poilievre caught off-guard:   Conservative leader wasn't prepared for rise of Carney and Trump upending race,2025.0,"""There are unknown unknowns."" That's how former U.S. Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld referred to the risks that come from situations so unexpected they would not normally be considered. Unknown unknowns are far more difficult to anticipate than known unknowns. This typology of knowns forms the ""Rumsfeld Matrix,"" which is often used in strategic planning in business and, presumably, by political strategists. What were the ""known unknowns"" that federal Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and his advisers could have anticipated during his meteoric rise in the polls? This rise began in the spring of 2022, when the Conservatives and Liberals were closely matched and continued until early this year, when they had established a 24-point lead prior to Trudeau's resignation and a subsequent surge in support for the Liberals. They must have known that, at some point, the relentless attacks against a ""wacko"" prime minister who ""broke Canada"" would succeed. That Canadians would grow weary of him. And he'd lose his caucus' support. They must have known that the carbon tax election they demanded would become irrelevant if the Liberals changed their stance. They must have known that a potential Donald Trump return to the White House could threaten Canada's economy with a stronger mandate to put America first. And they must have known that Mark Carney was organizing to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a moment's notice. The resignation of finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, followed by the prime minister's, and the Liberals' pivot on carbon pricing were perhaps unknown unknowns. But the potential for a perfect storm triggered by Trump 2.0 must have been foreseen. In business, these scenarios are usually gamed out with plans to handle various outcomes. However, planning for a new narrative for the Conservative party seems to be occurring rather late. According to CBC reporting, the party has commissioned surveys to help adapt Poilievre's message to the new reality. This includes testing new lines of attack against the Liberals. Meanwhile, several Conservatives believe much money has been invested in Axe the Tax, with little time left to change course. In my line of work, this means we have been hit by external factors we don't control and did not plan for. We're conducting research to figure out a new strategy. And there are strong differences of opinion among the C-suite on the go-forward strategy. That is usually quite destabilizing and puts you in a competitively weak position. Meanwhile, Poilievre has a fresh sign on the lectern about ""Canada First."" And Carney - not a career politician - would apparently lift the Liberals in the polls to a tie with the Conservatives, thereby erasing the Conservatives' massive lead - if you believe recent polls. Back in 2022, Maclean's appropriately asked on its cover ""Why Is Pierre Poilievre So Angry?"" We've learned why over the past three years. And now, as he faces a quickly changing situation, he no doubt isn't any happier than he was when he started. That's a challenge for a man who's been on the attack his entire political life. Canadians don't want an attack dog. They now want a guard dog. And that's a space another conservative, Doug Ford, Ontario's self-proclaimed protector, is more than happy to occupy during a snap election. And, while it's too soon to know for sure, Carney is unlikely to be anyone's lap dog. This asks the question: Can the Conservatives teach their dog new tricks? Perhaps. But there's little time. Furthermore, one has to wonder if Poilievre would want to, or be able to, walk away from a political style that has served him so well thus far - a political persona the party tried to soften with ""meet Pierre the husband and father"" ads coinciding with a new look. He still attacks and opposes much more naturally than he charms. He now needs to prove he can inspire trust and confidence as Canadians face the consequences of a known known: Donald Trump is going to affect our lives for at least four more years.

Geoff Russ: Conservatives must build on the legacies of Macdonald and Mulroney,2025.0,"Sir John A. Macdonald and Brian Mulroney were two great prime ministers who helped make Canada into a magnificent country that we call home. Despite their apparent contradictions, reconciling their legacies is how Canada moves forward under a new, Conservative prime minister. Macdonald led the infant Dominion's first government in 1867, and he remains the second-longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Of the Fathers of Confederation, he was the first among equals. Macdonald's National Policy of high tariffs and his belief in railways as a nation-building tool laid the foundations for a strong and independent Canada. For him, there was no greater threat to Canada than the creep of the United States, and his life's work was ensuring that our country was not snuffed out in its infancy. The fact that Canada managed to expand from sea to sea, let alone survive in the wake of Manifest Destiny is nothing short of providential in its own right. Safeguarding the ongoing integrity of the country is a first-order priority for any government. In 1988, more than a century after Confederation, Brian Mulroney led a more mature and secure Canada into free trade with the U.S. He also firmly reoriented the country with the democratic West during the Cold War, after years of Pierre Trudeau's rapprochement and vacillation with the communist bloc. By signing the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement that swiftly evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mulroney cemented our comparative advantage of sharing a border with the U.S. As a result, Canadians have a better standard of living and a healthier economy. The nearly four decades of North American free trade were great years of rising material wealth and comfort that strengthened Canada and the well-being of its people. It is Mulroney's greatest legacy, and there should be no reactive revisionism about that due to U.S. President Donald Trump's belligerence and aggression. Free trade is still worth striving for. Canada relies upon it as a resource exporter and an importer of manufactured foreign goods. If the U.S. is retreating from continental free trade, Canada must look for new partners to fill the gaps. We should only do so in a principled fashion, and resist the temptation to expand our commercial ties with bad actors like China. There is no moral high ground to be gained by becoming friends with the 21st century's worst totalitarian states. A strong and independent Canada would be a major roadblock to the geographic domination sought by Russia and China in the Arctic and Indo-Pacific. They are already making incursions and flyovers into the north, and that territory must remain firmly Canadian. Fortifying and building up the Arctic is the next great frontier of Canadian history, and is as important now as the railways were at the end of the 19th century. At this point, Trump's threats to annex Canada and make it the 51st state are more of a rhetorical irritant than a military threat, but it should be the motivation to create a Canada that stands on its own two feet without a helping hand. There is no greater way to uphold Macdonald's legacy than to ensure the country he brought into existence does not disappear from the Earth. Fighting against the internal subversive forces that have been waging war on his legacy should be another goal for conservatives. Once the most honoured prime minister in Canadian history, Macdonald has been all but erased from the public space by vandals and cast as a villain by the federal government. To restore his legacy, however, the Liberals must be clobbered by the Conservatives in the upcoming general election. Macdonald and Mulroney excelled at this, and it will be a satisfying way to emulate both of them. A new Canadian era will be ushered in by finally seeing off the Trudeau Liberals, and banishing their ghoulish great white hope Mark Carney into an opulent exile in New York or London. Their decade at the top has been disastrous: Canadians are poorer and Canada is a more expensive place to live, with national pride among younger Canadians lagging badly A country whose youth have no hope for the future, has no future. A terminal government whose primary motivation is keeping their jobs cannot be trusted to safeguard the country, let alone improve it So much will have changed since the last Conservative government if they return to power. The assumptions held in 2015 for the future of Canada, North America and the world have been uprooted and tossed aside. To reclaim the pride of being a secure, sovereign, and strong country, Canada must first recover from this lost decade of mediocrity-turned-misery. There is no better way to accomplish that than rebuilding our military, removing the petty restraints shackled upon our economy by bad government policies and aggressively seeking free trade with friendly countries overseas. Canada has no great political philosophers, and the visions and thoughts of the prime ministers continue to redefine and shape our politics more than anyone else. Despite being two towering figures of Canadian conservatism, the legacies of Macdonald and Mulroney may seem difficult to reconcile. Macdonald's National Policy and Mulroney's continentalism are things of the past, but what they both sought, above all, was national strength through independence and partnerships. A friendly White House is no longer a guarantee, and with new leadership at the helm, this era is the next stage of Canada's national evolution.

"After 'Canada First' rally, Poilievre supporters say they're ready to go beyond 'axe the tax'",2025.0,"OTTAWA - As Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre vows to carry his crusade against the carbon tax into the next election, Canadians still need to hear more from him, say some of his supporters. Standing outside the Ottawa convention centre, National Post spoke with nearly 20 of his supporters and others who stood in line to waiting to see Poilievre speak at his ""Canada First"" rally Saturday, some of whom were unable to get inside and told the event was at capacity. While those left in the cold pointed to the crowd size as proof Poilievre was on the right track, others shared their thoughts on what he had to do to win the next election, particularly as some public opinion polls suggest the race against the Liberals to be tightening, with Mark Carney emerging as a fresh face in the party's leadership contest. Much like the internal Conservative debates around how much Poilievre should push his axe the tax message while Canada finds itself on a brink of a trade war with the U.S., his supporters were also split. ""I get it,"" said Amber Hall, of Poilievre's rhetoric around the carbon tax. ""It would be nice if he could soften things up so he's a little bit more approachable because I worry that he's just not very approachable by a lot of Canadians."" Pedro Alfaro is originally from Peru but lives in Montreal and travelled to Ottawa hoping to see Poilievre. While he likes the message, he had one suggestion: ""Maybe a little more friendly."" Others put it more bluntly. ""That's a little bit old news,"" said Paul Touzin. ""Obviously we have to go down that road, too, but I think there's much more important things that are on the on the agenda right now."" ""He's got to be a bit more relevant to the people."" Topping that list for many Canadians is the threat of a trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced plans to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum, after pledging to levy 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imports and 10 per cent on energy resources, which was ultimately delayed until early March. Then there are Trump's comments about Canada becoming a state. The point of Poilievre's rally was to show Canadians he has a plan to deal with U.S., and signalled the start of a shift where the tariffs threats headline an affordability theme, which Poilievre wants to keep as his main message. Lynn Totvim, from Gatineau, Q.C., attended curious to hear what Poilievre had to say when it came to the Americans. ""Sounds to me that he wants to stand up to Mr. Trump,"" she said afterwards. Even though Canada is dealing with Trump's tariff threat, Totvim believes it to be important that he keeps telling Canadians he will axe the tax. ""We're over taxed,"" she says. ""They can relay that message in various different ways,"" added supporter Krista Zingel. ""They absolutely should stay on it."" Supporter Deborah Gill joined the Conservatives in 2022 to vote for Poilievre in the party's leadership contest. ""I don't trust the Liberals will cut it,"" she said. Getting more details from Poilievre on what he would do if he forms the next government, was a motivator for rally attendees and something they believe those not yet ready to vote for him must hear. ""I'd like more details because I heard a lot about axe the tax but I want to hear what's next,"" said Joshua Jespersen, who said he lacks a family doctor and is concerned about affording a home. ""The other parties are starting to pivot away from the tax and so I don't think that works anymore."" Supporter John Coffey believes the Conservative leader should more directly explain how he would handle the U.S. While it ""sounds good to, like, axe the tax,"" Coffey said giving Canadians more details about how Poilievre would spend his first few years in government would likely ease their anxiety about what a potential Conservative government could look like. ""It'd be nice if he actually went to the United States and spoke with Trump, but I suppose that's not something that can be done at the moment."" Since Trump's victory last November, Poilievre has not signalled any intention of travelling to Washington to try and meet with the president or any administration officials. For Morris Hareuther, who was unable to squeeze inside, the Conservative leader has done a good job spelling out some of his policy proposals. ""That being said,"" he says, ""at this point, we need to be more there, especially under the circumstances with the trade tariffs coming up. I think we have to show that we're reasonable, logical, level-headed people to deal with.""

Jamie Sarkonak: Poilievre's genuine patriotism is the answer to Trump's threats,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre delivered the Conservative response to Donald Trump's tariff mania on Saturday, which consisted of three prongs: national pride, self-sufficiency and, above all, sovereignty. ""Let me be clear,"" he told the crowd at Ottawa's Rogers Centre. ""We will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country."" In an hour-long speech, he recognized Canada's long history of friendship with the United States, but stood his ground when it came to defending Canada. As far as the relationship with the U.S. goes, it's the exact tone he needs to hit right now: the low growl of a normally agreeable wolf backed into a corner, ready to fight if need be - distinguished, of course, from Chrsytia Freeland's yappy Pomeranian-headed-into-a-pit-fight act. ""We have to be prepared for the worst,"" Poilievre said. ""Simply put, we can no longer depend on the Americans alone for our trade. We can no longer think of them as our backup defence. These threats, my friends, are a wake-up call. We should be the wealthiest and most self-reliant economy in the world today."" As for how to get there, Poilievre stuck to a familiar set of promises. Retaliatory tariffs, targeted to maximally impact American companies, and using the proceeds to support the most tariff-impacted businesses at home was one piece, was a pitch first made two weeks ago. Cutting the carbon tax and scraping Bill C-69, the Liberal law that gummed up the ability for industry to build, were others. He also supported the construction of an east-west pipeline (not a new sentiment), as well as the immediate granting of permits for mining in the Ontario ""Ring of Fire"" - a remote region loaded with critical minerals (not quite a new idea; as he'd already planned to unlock it prior). And, on border control and crime, he re-iterated promises to jail druglords for life and beef up border security. Importantly, Poilievre diagnosed the big-picture problem that has made Canada so vulnerable to American bullying in the first place: a lack of interest in cultivating national pride. Here, Poilievre repeated promises to restore the old Canadian passport which featured national symbols (rather than the Liberal-updated version decorated with generic vector art) and build more national monuments. Newly added to the list was a plan to expand the Cadet Corps. The themes aren't new (in Conservative circles at least; the same can't be said for the last four weeks of Liberal faux-patriotism). What is new, however, is the context around them: the American president's jokes, or threats, of annexation; the on-and-off tariff war; the even-darker economic reality that's floating just over the horizon; and the Liberals' sudden interest in appropriating longtime Conservative priorities as their own. So, it's more important than ever that Poilievre stake his claim on these ideas, refusing to allow his opponents to poach them. He's very aware of this: ""First, the Liberals said I had no policies. Then they said my policies were scary. Now they pretend dishonestly to agree with all my policies, 60 days before an election. I take it as a compliment, but don't believe them for a minute."" Which is why it's puzzling that the Conservative leader is holding himself back. He knows very well that Liberal convergence on policy is a threat especially now that Trump has decided to use Canada as a trade punching bag. It's reflected in his shrinking lead in the polls. Yet, he's careful to draw a detour around certain hot-button issues that his party should have in the bag. Immigration received zero real mention in Poilievre's Saturday speech (aside from the familiar pledges to streamline professional credential recognition for immigrants and strengthen border security). But immigration is an issue of top concern in Canada - Ipsos puts it on par with taxes, below only inflation and health care - where people now have to compete with the world for jobs and housing. Poilievre did at least say he'd restore Harper-era levels of immigration in a recent interview with Juno News, which would still mean incoming numbers as high as 250,000 per year. Nor did he talk about de-Liberalizing the federal government, which has been co-opted to funnel taxpayer funds into politically aligned non-profits, court programs and activist groups. He did, of course, talk about cutting costs generally, as well as foreign aid, but that's only one piece of the greater puzzle. Saturday's speech was good, but it wasn't Poilievre at his full power. He, and/or his team, want to shed his committee attack dog image and replace it with something more fuzzy. They want to craft a benevolent, no-nonsense, ""Canada First"" dad - and avoid, at all costs, sounding mean. But it also means avoiding the very topics the Liberals would dare not touch - the topics that would be certain to differentiate him from the rest. It's a safe play, at least.

Stephen Harper: The raucous birth of our great flag,2025.0,"For centuries, Canada's identity was stitched together under borrowed banners, but the debate over a true national flag sparked some of the most defining moments in the country's history. Releasing on Feb. 25, Flags of Canada by The Right Honourable Stephen J. Harper - an avid vexillologist and Canada's 22nd prime minister - chronicles the political battles, cultural tensions and national aspirations that led to the adoption of the Maple Leaf flag on this day in 1965. Published by Sutherland House Books in association with the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for the flag's 60th anniversary, Flags of Canada reveals how a symbol of unity emerged from one of Canada's most polarizing debates. World War II fundamentally altered Canada's place in the world. It was not just that the country declared and pursued its own war effort. In a reversal of historical roles, it was Canada helping to save the United Kingdom during the Battle of Britain in 1940. That same year, Canada entered into a mutual defence agreement with the United States, which henceforth became its most critical ally. The implications of this new strategic positioning were not entirely understood at the time. In any case, a new flag debate broke out almost as soon as the fighting ended. The groundwork was being laid during the war itself. As WWII progressed, the Canadian Red Ensign increasingly dislodged not only the Canadian Battle Flag, but also the Union Jack and other service ensigns, as the flag of the Canadian war effort and of Canadian nationhood generally. Canadian officials would invariably use the banner when they found themselves at allied meetings. Shortly after the final surrender of the Axis powers in 1945, cabinet authorized the flying of the Canadian Red Ensign over all federal government buildings ""until such time as action is taken by Parliament for the formal adoption of a national flag."" The proposal put forward by the National Flag League, the project of the largely Francophone Ligue du drapeau national and the mainly Anglophone Native Sons of Canada. While a few supporters of the Union Jack vehemently objected, even the opposition Conservatives overwhelmingly supported the decision. Indeed, they began to press Prime Minister King to make the Canadian Red Ensign the official national flag. This time, King decided to be proactive. He launched a joint parliamentary committee to study the flag question. It received over 2,500 suggestions, more than ten times the number that had appeared in 1925. Union Jacks, stars, fleurs-de-lis, beavers, crowns, and/or crosses were contained in many of the submissions. However, maple leaves were far and away the dominant symbol proposed, being present in some 60 percent of designs. This input seemed to confirm King's instincts. He believed that the country was gravitating toward the Canadian Red Ensign, but that it wanted stronger, more immediately recognizable, Canadian symbolism. From behind the curtain, he pushed the committee toward his preference. It would turn out to be a new Canadian Red Ensign with the coat of arms replaced by a single, large, gold maple leaf. Recall that similar designs had been mooted as far back as the 1890s. In this case, a very ""leafy"" version of the maple was proposed, which was both odd and unattractive. Public opinion was evolving more quickly than the wily old prime minister realized. A grassroots campaign had emerged to advocate for an altogether different alternative: the proposal of the National Flag League. It was actually the project of two organizations, the largely Francophone Ligue du drapeau national and the mainly Anglophone Native Sons of Canada. The King's preference was a new Canadian Red Ensign with the coat of arms replaced by a single, large, gold maple leaf. The National Flag League offered a clear rationale for its choice of colours. Red, it explained, was the traditional colour of British-Canadians, and white was that of French-Canadians. This seems far more likely than anything officials had admitted when they had pushed the combination back in 1921. It was a compelling, yet subtle way to reflect a two-nations heritage. The sole symbol on the banner was a single Canadian maple leaf in green. That colour was to represent the land, and, in any event, the coat of arms still sported green leaves. Through 1946, the parliamentary committee moved toward consensus on the simplified Canadian Red Ensign. However, close to half the public submissions were supporting the National Flag League option. The federal government was then hit with a broadside. The Legislative Assembly of Quebec pre-emptively voted to reject any flag that included any sign of colonialism. It was a transparent attack on the inclusion of the Union Jack in the design. King ultimately declined to move the committee's recommendation forward. He sensed that public opinion was not merely divided, but that it risked becoming polarized. As he had done in 1925, the prime minister moved to end the parliamentary debate. While the debate would continue in the country, King would have nothing more to do with it. Over time, a fascinating dynamic had unfolded around the Canadian Red Ensign. In the early 1900s, as Anglophones were subordinating it to the Union Jack, Francophones were prepared to support it. In the 1920s, with Anglophones raising its status, Francophones had concluded it could only be tolerated with the inclusion of equal French symbolism. And now, just as Anglophones were fully embracing it, Francophones deemed it unacceptable. This dynamic had prevented a national flag from emerging in Ottawa, yet it had led to consensus around a provincial flag in Quebec. The alternative, a model based on purely Canadian symbolism, was just as far from consensus. But the National Flag League design had, with little high-profile backing, emerged as the single biggest challenger to the traditional patterns. It would also prove to be the unmistakeable forerunner of our eventual national flag. In 1957, the newly elected Conservative government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker made significant changes to Canada's coat of arms, simplifying the form of the Irish harp and changing the maple leaves from green to red. * * * A key step in the final flag debate was undertaken before it truly began by people who really did not want it to happen. In 1957, the newly elected Conservative government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker made significant changes to Canada's coat of arms. For one thing, the Irish harp was given a simplified form. For another, the maple leaves were finally changed from green to red. The decision had the effect of removing any ambiguity about Canada's national colours. It was soon reflected in various flags and other insignia. For example, it has determined all versions of the Canadian flags of members of the royal family. They are essentially cloth versions of the shield, often with a personal mark or crest added. Of course, the change in the shield also necessitated further modification to the Canadian Red Ensign. Meanwhile, the postwar years were witnessing profound shifts in Western societies. By the 1960s, wide gaps were evident in the worldview of those who had come of age before and during the war versus those who were younger. In Canada, these social changes were overlaid by unique dynamics among both the Anglophone and Francophone populations. Among Anglophones, the decline of the connection to the United Kingdom was evident. The British Empire was dissolving, and the Commonwealth, while it remained an important global association, was simply not as relevant to political consciousness in Canada. At the same time, the new relationship with the United States created a mixed reaction. The American alliance gave English-Canadians their greatest level of national security ever. But this closeness also threatened their sense of separate identity in a way the British relationship never did. For its part, French-Canadian life was undergoing some of the most radical social change in the world. Particularly in Quebec, Francophones were moving from one of the most traditionally pious peoples on the planet to one of the most thoroughly secularized. And French-Canadian identity in its heartland was rapidly morphing into explicit Quebec nationalism. The new consciousness of Anglophones was bound to find expression in a renewed Canadian nationalism and a rekindled interest in national symbols such as the flag. The new nationalism of Francophones implied the potential risk of Quebec separatism. The Liberal Party, whose electoral fortunes depended on Quebec, was especially alert to that risk. In any case, both developments led the federal Liberal leader, Lester Pearson, to make the adoption of an official national flag a firm commitment as early as 1960. The flag debate that followed Pearson's election as prime minister was the shortest and the most intense in Canadian history. Increasing public discussion had begun to produce the normal flow of proposals. However, Pearson put the cat among the pigeons when, in May 1964, he produced his own preferred alternative. It was quickly, usually pejoratively, dubbed the Pearson Pennant. The change in the shield, or Canada's coat of arms, necessitated further modification to the Canadian Red Ensign. Pearson's flag was anything but strange. Its principal feature was the three-red-maple-leaves sprig from the coat of arms. The prime minister, in his quest for an exclusively Canadian design, had borrowed a simplified version of Duguid's original Canadian Battle Flag. But Pearson believed that the symbol on a plain white background would appear too empty. He had thus chosen a variant created by Lieutenant Commander Alan Beddoe, whose blue sidebars were meant to reflect Canada's ""sea to sea"" national motto. The blue bars were controversial in more heraldically orthodox quarters. They were not the traditional ""wavy lines"" way of depicting water bodies (although Pearson's intent was metaphoric, not geographic). More notably, they departed from the national colours. Of course, these had only been recently confirmed, whereas Pearson's selection derived from both the British and French mother countries. It also helped that the blue detracted from the charge that the Pearson Pennant was a partisan Liberal banner. The boldest part of Pearson's proposal was his intention to push his flag through Parliament as a confidence measure. It was brash, given the nature of the issue alone. It was more so considering the reality that his government did not command a majority in the Commons. He was soon forced to drop the idea. On the other side of the Commons, John Diefenbaker's Conservatives engaged in ferocious opposition from the outset. The former prime minister had been a lifelong booster of the Canadian Red Ensign. He did indicate that he was open to simplifying it by replacing the shield with a single white fleur-de-lis. However, two-nations designs no longer had a strong following at either end of the linguistic divide. In the meantime, the Tories dug into a filibuster that kept Parliament sitting all summer without resolution. In September, Pearson finally agreed to submit the question to a parliamentary committee. As in 1945-1946, this led to a flood of submissions that would eventually crest at nearly six thousand. Being the 1960s, they included both the absurdly abstract and the clearly comical. Still, on balance, the proposals displayed the same range and frequency of symbols as in the debate of two decades earlier. Objective polling on the matter was scarce, but it is safe to say that the debate broke down into two broad camps: the traditionalists and the nationalists. To be clear, each side proclaimed its dedication both to time- honoured symbols and to patriotic values. But their emphases differed markedly. The traditionalist camp was dominated by backers of the Canadian Red Ensign. It had had a following, generally a growing one, for almost a hundred years. Sentiment was strongest among war veterans, who viewed it as the flag they had fought under. But there was still a minority who favoured the Union Jack, especially among those who most keenly valued the British connection. They included recent immigrants from the United Kingdom and people who lived in areas of the country culturally closer to Britain, such as Newfoundland and Vancouver Island. In May 1964, Lester B. Pearson produced his own preferred alternative, which was quickly, usually pejoratively, dubbed the Pearson Pennant. The nationalist camp was clearly larger, but it was also more diffuse and less intense in its views. That said, it seems there were two flags in that group that had significant followings. One was the Pearson Pennant. The other was based on a suggestion by historian George Stanley, dean of arts at the Royal Military College. Stanley proposed using that institution's flag, retaining the red bars on each side, but replacing the Royal Military College emblem in the white centre with a single red maple leaf. We do not know which of these new alternatives had more support. Nevertheless, there is ample reason to believe that the prime minister's proposal was ahead. That was certainly true in the case of the parliamentary committee examining the various designs. Once the Canadian Red Ensign had been voted down, the Conservative members of the committee preferred the blue-bar design. However, they secretly voted for the red-bar design to prevent a consensus around the prime minister's flag. The Liberals naturally followed Pearson's preference, but they privately decided that it would be seen as too partisan. They also voted for the Stanley-inspired option. Politics being politics, while everybody preferred the blue-bars pennant, the red-bars alternative passed unanimously. The matter then returned to the Commons. There, Diefenbaker's forces regrouped for another filibuster, demanding the matter go to referendum. With the debate becoming increasingly polarized, the Tories' Quebec caucus broke with their leader in December and agreed to have the matter voted on through closure. The rest, as they say, is history. The national flag - to be clear, the first official national flag of Canada - became law on February 15, 1965.

Campbell flummoxes the Fleet:   Toronto goaltender finds her footing with some big saves in win over Boston,2025.0,"Kristen Campbell is out to silence the critics. The Sceptres goaltender got off to slow start for the second straight season, but it's been longer this time. With a .888 save percentage through nine games - the lowest of any goalie who has appeared in more than six - Campbell was still searching for the form that earned PWHL goalie of the year honours. ""Last year, it was kind of the same story. People were doubting me and saying things, but I never listen to the outside noise,"" Campbell said last month. ""I'm so focused on what I need to do ... and I know that those tough times are what allows me to have those highs."" She experienced one of those highs Friday night at Coca-Cola Coliseum, stopping 16 shots in a 3-1 win over the Boston Fleet. The Sceptres have at least a point in six straight games, and the victory was Campbell's first since Jan. 14. She wasn't tested heavily early on as the Sceptres controlled the play, but stood tall when needed. The Manitoba product flashed the leather on back-to-back saves, denying Boston's Hannah Brandt and Megan Keller just 20 seconds apart midway through the frame - drawing ""Soooouup!"" chants from the crowd. At Thursday's practice, Sceptres head coach Troy Ryan reiterated that a goalie rotation would continue with a four-game road swing coming. Raygan Kirk began the season as the backup, but started four of the previous five games, with three wins and a .915 save percentage in that stretch. ""One thing we definitely know is we need both of them in this little stretch that we're on,"" he said. ""We're going to try to be strategic and use this little spell to try to get both of them in a good place."" After Emma Maltais scored for the Sceptres as a power play expired, Keller tied it with a blast to Campbell's glove side. The Fleet continued to press, but Campbell held the fort. Emma Woods netted the eventual game-winner in the second period, and Jesse Compher's sixth of the season added insurance in the third. The Sceptres' charge up the standings continues. They're just two points behind the defending champion Minnesota Frost for second place in the six-team league, after spending most of January near the bottom. Scoring a slice As fans chanted ""Pizza! Pizza!"" at Coca-Cola Coliseum, Woods took a pass from Izzy Daniel and roofed the puck past Boston goaltender Aerin Frankel, restoring Toronto's lead and ensuring a free slice for everyone in the crowd. The Pizza Pizza Score a Slice promotion triggers when the team scores in the final minute of the second period, like Woods did with 20 seconds left. It was the first such goal this season, and the 29-year-old forward's first since Dec. 27 (also against the Fleet) snapping a 10-game drought. Road trip The Sceptres have a quick turnaround, heading to Edmonton to play the Ottawa Charge on Sunday in a neutral-site game at Rogers Place - home of the Oilers. They'll then travel to New York to take on the Sirens on Feb. 23 before pit stops in Minnesota and Montreal. Their next home game is March 6, which is also the day star centre Sarah Nurse is first eligible to be activated from long-term injured reserve.

"Carney changes game for Poilievre, and maybe Trump",2025.0,"If Mark Carney is the next prime minister who has to deal with Donald Trump, the U.S. president may need to change up his game on the insults he's been tossing in Canada's direction. Calling Carney ""governor"" won't exactly have the same sting, given that the man increasingly seen as the front-running Liberal leadership contender has actually been a governor of two national banks - Canada and the Bank of England. It might even be seen as a mark of respect, something that Trump hasn't exactly been showing to this country and ""governor"" Justin Trudeau in recent weeks. That isn't the only way in which Carney's candidacy for leadership has been forcing some readjustment in the heated political rhetoric at this tumultuous time in the country's history. Pierre Poilievre and his team have increasingly focused most of their attention on Carney, as repeated polls keep showing that a leadership win for him would narrow the polling gap between Liberals and the Conservatives. On Friday, as Conservatives were meeting on Parliament Hill, they appeared single-mindedly focused on Carney, vowing to tar him with the same brush they've been using so devastatingly against Trudeau and the Liberals for the past couple of years. Clearly, the Conservatives are reading the same polls that Canadian political junkies have been following with interest in recent days. The latest ""It's Political"" podcast from my colleague Althia Raj also focuses on this fast-moving change in political dynamics. Philippe J. Fournier, founder of the 338Canada website, which does statistical political projections, is one of the guests on the podcast and someone who has been out front on the Carney-Poilievre matchup. In a piece written for The Walrus this week, Fournier lays it out bluntly, in an article headlined: ""Pierre Poilievre's Lead Was Supposed to Be Unshakable. It Isn't."" Fournier tracks a number of polls showing how Carney is forcing Canadian politicos to reconsider what looked inevitable not so long ago - most notably a massive Conservative victory in the next election and the collapse of the Liberal party. He cites a Pallas poll from this month, which seized a lot of attention. ""When Pallas tested a Carney-led Liberal party against its rivals, the result was a statistical tie: Liberals at 39 per cent, Conservatives at 38 per cent,"" Fournier writes. Similar findings have been charted in recent days. Nanos Research, in a poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail, showed that 40 per cent of respondents believed Carney would do the best job negotiating with Trump, compared to 26 per cent for Poilievre and only 13 per cent choosing former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Fournier also pays particular attention to a Quebec-only Leger poll released last week, showing how the prospect of Carney in charge is making a tectonic change in fortunes for parties in that province, where the Bloc Québécois has enjoyed a comfortable lead. However, in results that Fournier clearly believe bear strong attention, Leger found that if Carney is the next prime minister, 38 per cent of Quebec respondents would support the Liberals, compared to 24 per cent for the Bloc and 22 per cent for the Conservatives. ""You read that correctly: in this hypothetical scenario - which seems increasingly plausible as the Liberal leadership race progresses - a Carney-led Liberal party would hold a fourteen-point lead over the Bloc,"" Fournier writes. The margin of error for all these polls is generally within two percentage points, and Fournier stresses how the Carney numbers are well beyond those boundaries in all of them. So what is going on here? One is tempted to quip that Poilievre has spent so much time convincing Canadians that anybody would be better than Trudeau, that voters have seized on the next new thing. Or, relatedly, that the next election was supposed to be all about change, and Canadians are now in search of an outcome different from the one they've long been told to expect after election 2025. This is where it is worth reflecting on a reality that Conservatives don't like to accept: that Poilievre has a likability problem. The Star and Abacus Data have been tracking this for a while. As I've also written, it was hard to miss last fall how even Conservative-friendly commentators, or at least those pretty much fed up with Trudeau and the Liberals, were starting to talk about Poilievre's problems in the realm of likability. The whole, all-contempt, all-the-time approach was red meat for the Conservative base, but Canadians looking for something more hopeful and upbeat could be put off by the unrelenting negativity. It's probably too early to declare any winners in any of the races now consuming Canadian politics, so no one should be throwing victory parties for Carney yet. But the same is now true for Poilievre and that's a big change from the projections of just a few weeks ago. CAPTION: Mark Carney's candidacy for the Liberal leadership has been forcing some readjustment in the heated political rhetoric at this tumultuous time in Canada's history, Susan Delacourt writes.ETHAN CAIRNS THE CANADIAN PRESS CREDIT: susan delacourt OPINION","Toronto Star; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,"Torstar Syndication Services, a Division of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited","Feb 15, 2025",Conservatism; Governors; Politics; Prime ministers,,2025-02-15,Toronto Star
"Conservative MPs launch attacks against Carney:   Scheer, Lantsman and Barrett accuse former central banker of elitism as polls shift",2025.0,"Conservative MPs are targeting Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney, accusing the former central banker of being an elitist who is out of touch with the concerns of working Canadians. Heading into a caucus meeting Friday, the MPs took aim at Mr. Carney, seeking to link him to unpopular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “He lives in a completely different world. He doesn’t buy groceries in tough neighbourhoods or take public transit,” Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer told reporters. U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose hefty tariffs on Canadian imports and Mr. Carney’s decision to renounce consumer carbon pricing has taken the wind out of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s plans to run an election campaign on scrapping the levy. Recent public-opinion polls have shown a narrowing of the gap between the Conservatives and Liberals as Canadians consider who is most capable of dealing with Mr. Trump and his “America First” economic agenda. Mr. Scheer also berated Mr. Carney for saying earlier this week that fentanyl abuse is a serious crisis in the United States but only a challenge in Canada. Mr. Scheer said more than 50,000 Canadians have died from fentanyl overdoses since the Liberals came to power in 2015. “A direct result of the CarneyTrudeau Liberals giving out free opioids, legalizing drug use in public spaces and to downplay that, to refuse to call it a crisis, to call it a challenge shows you that he doesn’t have to deal with these types of consequences,” Mr. Scheer said. He also went after the Liberal government for cancelling pipeline projects and turning aside Europe’s interest in liquefied natural gas facilities on the East Coast. Mr. Carney has said that he would be open to energy projects if he is elected by his party and takes over as prime minister after the Liberal leadership vote on March 9. Deputy Conservative leader Melissa Lantsman said Canadians shouldn’t trust Mr. Carney’s pledge to scrap consumer carbon pricing, since he also pledged to increase the industrial carbon levy. That would hit Canadian steel and aluminum plants, industries already facing the threat of 25-per-cent U.S. tariffs, she said. “This is not axing the carbon tax,” she said. Pollster Nik Nanos said it’s understandable why the Conservatives are targeting Mr. Carney, but it also comes with risks. “The Conservatives have to be very careful because by attacking Carney, they are validating him as a threat, and a serious threat,” he said in an interview. “If they focus on Carney, more Canadians will be thinking ‘Hey, maybe I should take a look at this Carney guy.’ ” Mr. Poilievre has a major ”Canada First” rally planned for Saturday in Ottawa as he pivots from mostly talking about carbon pricing to defending the country from Mr. Trump. The Conservative Leader needs to lay out clearly how he would deal with Mr. Trump and not just rely on clever slogans and photo ops, Mr. Nanos said “For Poilievre, he has to be more than just a cheerleader for Canadian patriotism, Canadians want to hear details. They want to know what would be his approach, tone and strategy to dealing with Donald Trump,” he said. Mr. Scheer suggested that mainstream media is going easy on Mr. Carney and failing to ask him tough questions even though he “is about to become prime minister because a small group of Liberal Party members are going to install him.” Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett said Mr. Carney needs to be pressed on his corporate financial interests when he was also advising Mr. Trudeau on economic policy. “It’s unbelievable that this guy has provided no transparency whatsoever about what his financial interests are,” he said. “Mark Carney has been in witness protection and hasn’t answered a lot of questions.” When the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England stepped into the political arena, he resigned from a number of executive, board and advisory positions that had made him an influential and well-paid figure in the corporate world. As a leadership candidate with no seat in the House of Commons, Mr. Carney is not subject to the rules governing conflicts of interest that apply to MPs and public office holders. That means he is not required to take specific steps to manage potential conflicts during the leadership contest, such as placing assets he earned in his corporate career in a blind trust. If Mr. Carney wins the leadership race and becomes prime minister, however, he would then be subject to the Conflict of Interest Act, and he would be subject to the Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House of Commons if he wins a seat in a federal election. He would have to put his assets in a blind trust. Mr. Carney served as chair of both private media and finance company Bloomberg LP and Brookfield Asset Management, which controls about $1-trillion in assets globally. He had also sat on the boards of Stripe, a financial-services company, and had an advisory role with investment company PIMCO. He was also the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance; and a member of Harvard University’s board of overseers.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Fife, Robert",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 15, 2025",Conservatism; Political campaigns; Canadians; Conflicts of interest; Carbon; Prime ministers; Fentanyl; Tariffs; Political leadership,,2025-02-15,The Globe and Mail
"Patriotism, a big rally and, of course, new slogans: Inside Pierre Poilievre's Trump-induced strategy shift",2025.0,"OTTAWA- ""Canada First"" is Pierre Poilievre's new pitch to Canadians. But it also represents the firsts the Conservative leader himself has been navigating in the past few weeks. It's the first time as leader that he has faced off against the Liberals without Prime Minister Justin Trudeau planning to run in the next election. And U.S. President Donald Trump has dealt Poilievre another challenging first: Find a way to talk about affordability, an issue Poilievre has owned, without focusing it all on a ""carbon tax election,"" given the threat of a trade war with the U.S. seems to be overwhelming Canadians' other economic concerns right now. Something else new for Poilievre is that Liberals' unpopularity seems to have bottomed out and, with Trudeau leaving, their support is creeping up in the polls after more than a year-and-a-half of consistently slipping further behind the Conservatives. But even though their world has been shaken, Conservatives are not hitting the panic button. At least not yet. A Conservative MP, who was granted anonymity in order to speak freely, acknowledged what most Conservatives think: that they would definitely have preferred facing off against Trudeau in the upcoming election, given the prime minister's deep unpopularity. Poilievre will be unveiling what he believes to be the message and the tone Canadians want to hear at a Canada First rally on Saturday, staged to coincide with the previously unloved Flag Day, in the same downtown Ottawa convention centre where his leadership of the party began more than two years ago. Leading up to the branding relaunch, National Post spoke with 17 Conservative insiders, veteran strategists, organizers, MPs and grassroots members to understand the challenges Poilievre faces and some of the party's thinking in reorienting his pitch. The main thing they said: it all starts with Trump. Shortly after Trump's victory in November, Poilievre made it clear he wasn't going to be part of Trudeau's so-called Team Canada approach against the president's growing threats of tariffs and taking over Canada. While trying to steer clear of comments that could inflame relations with an unpredictable American leader, Poilievre kept the pressure on Trudeau, accusing him of sending jobs south of the border and criticizing his handling of Trump's first term in office. But then Trudeau announced on Jan. 6 he was resigning and Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20. After that, Conservative thinking changed. ""It's just frustrating, Trump has consumed all oxygen, and Canadians are feeding it by panicking,"" said another Conservative MP, who was also granted anonymity. ""It's all people are talking about."" As Trump's threat to hit all Canadian goods with 25-per-cent tariffs hovers like a storm cloud over the country, Poilievre tried in press conferences defending his call for an ""axe the tax election,"" despite everything else that was unfolding. ""Look, I'm not prime minister,"" he said when asked about making inroads with U.S. lawmakers. Inside the party, however, the debate was whether it was the right approach, and whether he needed to start facing the American issue head on. Especially as all the Liberal leadership contenders seemed to be signalling they weren't interested in defending Trudeau's consumer carbon tax. ""Pierre is normally ahead of the curve to identify issues that Canadians care about and leads on them. But I think on the flip side, he never wants to go off message. He very strongly believes in repetition,"" one insider said. The situation presented a challenge for Poilievre, who after more than a year dominating the political agenda in Ottawa, was now facing pressure to shift his message. ""I think Poilievre was too slow, he's catching on now, but he was too slow,"" said Peter Coleman, a longtime Conservative and president of the National Citizens Coalition, a grassroots, right-leaning group. One insider forcefully declared that the carbon-tax election message was ""dead."" Others said the party shouldn't rush its response in the midst of a volatile situation. Some also made the point that hindsight is always 20/20 and that Poilievre was faced with a ""lose-lose"" situation. By early February, the message had sunk it. Poilievre needed to appear more serious about the gravity of the trade threats. He did not criticize Trudeau's announcement on retaliatory tariffs. At the same time, he swapped out his more casual look for a suit. And signs on his press conference podiums were changed from ""Axe the Tax"" to ""Canada First."" The party also announced the Canada First rally to be staged on the 60th anniversary of the Canadian flag. Poilievre's office instructed MPs and their families to attend, and automated calls were sent out to ensure a big turnout. Supporters have been encouraged to wear red and white, with the playlist expected to be all-Canadian. While Conservatives still believe the top issues for voters are cost of living and crime, they see a rising sense of national pride, which Poilievre wants to capture. Allie Blades, a strategist who worked on Poilievre's 2022 leadership campaign in B.C., said the next election will be about the type of leader Canadians want as prime minister. ""We won't necessarily know what our biggest threat will be on the day that we go to the polls. But what I think Canadians will be looking towards is the type of leader that's going to take us through this next big fight."" Although Poilievre is known for his rallies, his speech Saturday is expected to strike a serious tone and tease out additional policy. He's planning to write it himself. But don't expect him to do away with his existing slogans. Instead, he will be adapting them. Instead of a ""common sense plan to axe the tax,"" it will be a ""common sense plan to axe the tax that puts Canadians first."" No longer will be it Poilievre's plan to ""stop the crime."" He will now be saying that his plan to ""stop the crime puts Canadians first."" He is also expected to repeat his previously announced plan to handle the U.S., including by calling for retaliatory tariffs and using the revenues to help workers. The message the Conservatives want Canadians to hear: ""Pierre Poilievre has always put Canada and Canadians first."" Ginny Roth, who served as Poilievre's communications director during his leadership bid, said a rally is a way to energize supporters and volunteers as expectations rise for a spring election. This one is also a chance to show Canadians it is the Conservatives who have been ""the patriots all along."" ""It's been, I think, grating for a lot of Conservatives to hear some of the progressive (Liberal and NDP) leaders who were so dismissive of patriotism, so dismissive of Canadian history ... to be newfound kind of vacant patriots"" in the face of the Trump threats, she said. In the lead up to Saturday, Poilievre has released promises from tearing down interprovincial trade barriers and stiffening the sentences for fentanyl traffickers to boosting border security and building an Arctic military base to be financed by dramatic cuts to foreign aid. Border security, fentanyl smuggling and Canada's lagging defence priorities have been a complaint of Trump's of course. While Conservatives applaud Poilievre's proposals, Philippe Fournier of polling aggregator 338Canada.com questions the wisdom of Poilievre's suggestion to cut aid, given Trump just made deep cuts to U.S. aid. That invites a comparison to Trump, when Canadians want someone to fight him. Critics also question the phrase Canada First, which sounds a lot like Trump's America First policy. Poilievre is a fan of former prime minister Wilfrid Laurier, whom he often cites. The phrase originated from a Laurier quotation: ""Let your motto be: Canada first, Canada last, Canada always."" Conservatives also know they need to be careful not to suggest Trump is right when it comes to blaming Canada's border security for the amount of illegal immigration and fentanyl in the U.S, all the while still promising to tackle these issues. Poilievre is also trying to make the point that the Liberals bear responsibility for the country's vulnerable economic position, which is now threatened by Trump, as a way to steer the message back to the cost of living, Poilievre's positional strong suit. ""We need to keep reminding people this is about affordability,"" said one Conservative MP. ""Axing the tax, axing a whole bunch of taxes, the capital gains tax. I still think taxes, pocketbook issues, affordability are going to feature prominently."" Fournier said it is smart for Conservatives to remain focused on affordability, but said it won't go over well with voters if ""they sound like Trump"" and are seen to be criticizing the Canadian government as it tries to fight the president's threats. Because Conservatives see the carbon tax as a symbol for larger cost-of-living issues, Poilievre isn't expected to stop talking about it, especially when it's proved so effective. Bailing on a key message would also be out of character for a Conservative leader who defines himself by his authenticity. And on axing the carbon tax, Poilievre has another claim to fame. He was there first.

It will be Carney vs. Poilievre; And neither has clear advantage,2025.0,"The Liberal leadership race is effectively over and the 2025 Canadian general election just got a lot more interesting. As with swallows and summers, one poll does not define any political contest. But any Liberals who decide to vote for anyone other than Mark Carney after Leger's latest survey might as well form a circular firing squad. The poll suggested that the Conservative lead across the countr y has been whittled down to nine points from 18 points during the firm's last survey. Leger has Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives at 40 per cent support, compared to 31 per cent for the Liberals. However, Liberal support rises to 37 per cent when respondents were asked to consider Carney as leader, while the number of Conservative voters slips into a statistical dead heat. (Given the inefficiency of a Conservative vote heavily concentrated in the West, that would likely see the Liberals re-elected.) The bad news for Chrystia Freeland's leadership campaign is that with her as leader, Liberal support declines to 28 per cent and the Conservatives maintain a strong lead at 38 per cent. Liberal party members would have to be pretty dumb to ignore such obvious signals from the electorate, and when it comes to holding onto power, Liberals are not dumb. As mentioned, this is just one poll, but the trendlines are supported by others. It is an exceptional turnaround in public sentiment, but we are living in a singular moment. When Justin Trudeau resigned just last month, most polling firms had the Conser vatives ahead by more than 20 percentage points. Yet, Poilievre's lead has always been predicated on deep enmity toward Trudeau, rather than an affection for the Conservative leader. Abacus Data polls consistently revealed that around one-third of those who said they supported Poilievre were parking their vote and could be persuaded to change their minds if a better alternative came along. For many of those people, Carney seems like the right person at the right time. The Leger poll suggests that eight out of 10 Canadians are concerned U.S. President Donald Trump will use tariffs to pressure Can- ada into a closer union with the U.S. Poilievre's ""axe the tax"" mantra resonates less loudly against the backdrop of potential annexation. The Conservative leader and Carney are in a statistical tie when it comes to being trusted to deal with Trump. But Carney has a clear advantage when it comes to experience in major crises. (I disclose, as I have before, that I have been friends with Carney for more than a decade.) The Conservatives have millions of dollars to paint the presumptive Liberal leader as ""Carbon Tax Carney"" or to denigrate his role as governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. But the facts remain: Carney was in the Cash Room at the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 with the other G7 finance ministers and central bankers when the decision was taken to backstop the banking system with liquidity to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression. He was chair of the Fi-nancial Stability Board, the international body that cleaned up the mess in the wake of the financial crisis. And he was the governor of the Bank of England who warned that Brexit would weaken the pound, undermine investment, lead to higher unemployment and cripple economic growth. (A 2021 report by the U.K. Office of Budget Responsibility calculated that Brexit will cost Britain four per cent of GDP per annum going forward or $57 billion a year). Against that, Poilievre's resume is, let's say, one-dimensional. The Conservative leader also sounds almost Trumpian in his rhetoric, in a way that could harm his cause with potential switch voters. That's not to suggest that he subscribes to Trump's delusional mercantilism or casual corruption. But in his Arctic security announcement this week, he talked of ""dramatically cutting foreign aid."" At a time when Trump is discarding allies, surely it would pay to do the opposite: to assert the value of soft power in the battle to win friends and influence people. Poilievre's sympathies are often too narrow for many voters who are not fully invested in his project. How many people were cheering him on this week, when he tweeted out that Carney was wearing $2,000 Zegna sneakers during a photo op? If there was ever a time to put away childish things, it is now. At the same time, Carney has baggage - not least the Liberal brand. Poilievre had a point when he said that the team of Trudeau ministers who are now backing Carney not only endorsed his agenda, they helped write it, push it and implement it. ""Keeping Trudeau's team is the same as keeping Trudeau."" The mere sight of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault endorsing Carney was probably enough for many Poilievre waverers to stiffen their spines. The sense that the Liberals need to be consigned to the penalty box remains strong and may be a decisive factor in the coming election. Then there is Carney himself. His defining mission in recent years has been climate action and it was telling that his first policy commitment was a plan that would dump the consumer carbon tax he says is now too divisive and replace it with a new approach that relies on financial incentives for appliances, cars and insulation. He would tighten existing output-based carbon regimes that regulate heavy emitters to avoid credit oversupply, though since those programs are run by the provinces it is not clear how he would do that. He would make investments in electrified transportation and develop a carbon-based adjustment mechanism - loosely, tariffs on countries that don't take climate action, to avoid ""carbon leakage."" It is a fairly modest plan. But the fact that it was his first priority is the problem. He has been vague, for example, about whether he is in favour of building pipelines east and west to diversify the customer base for our energy. Frankly, people have more immediate concerns, such as the president of the United States saying he wants to annex their country and plans to squeeze them economically until they submit to his will. If Trump follows through, as it appears he has every intention of doing, Canada's emissions growth will cease to be a problem because there will be no growth of any kind. The Leger poll suggests nearly nine in 10 Canadians are worried, if not stressed about it. The only source of consolation is that a roughly equal number say they feel pride in being Canadian, a significant increase on the number who said the same the last time the question was asked nearly a year ago. Carney has talked about us being masters in our own house; Poilievre has promised he will build a self-reliant, sovereign nation. The only way out of this mess is to choose a national leader who is resolute in defence of Canada, who is prepared to safeguard its economy and who is willing to use its natural resources to benefit all Canadians. The next election will be a contest to decide who is best positioned to do that job.

"Five key takeaways from the first Ontario election debate:   PC Leader Doug Ford was targeted for his record on housing, affordability and health care",2025.0,"Ontario’s four main political party leaders squared off on Friday in North Bay for the first of two debates, with the opposition targeting Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford for calling a snap election more than a year ahead of schedule. During the event, hosted by the Federation of Northern Ontario Municipalities, Mr. Ford defended his early election call, saying he needed another four-year term to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie and Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner went after Mr. Ford for his record on affordability, housing and health care, as well as ethics. The leaders frequently clashed on stage and spoke over one another, as the moderator, CBC Radio host Markus Schwabe, tried to steer the conversation back to prearranged topics that had a focus on Northern Ontario issues, such as forestry, mining, and highway maintenance. The PC Leader focused his remarks on the economy and Mr. Trump, but also attacked his rivals for opposing his government’s measures and accused them of supporting higher taxes. He aimed most of his barbs at Ms. Crombie, the former mayor of Mississauga, whom recent polls have shown in a distant second place. The second, and final, debate before the election takes place Monday night. Ontarians go to the polls Feb. 27. Here are some key take-aways from the leaders’ first clash: 1) Donald Trump, and an early vote The U.S. President cast a shadow over the debate, with Mr. Ford referencing Mr. Trump’s tariffs in his opening remarks as the biggest threat to the province’s economy. The other leaders criticized the PC Leader for calling the campaign in the middle of a crisis – and heading to Washington this week. ""You fly off in the middle of an election for photo-ops in Washington with low-level advisers,"" Ms. Crombie said. ""What’s the point?"" 2) Housing While Ontario has seen its number of housing starts sink, Mr. Ford – who has slashed rules meant to preserve farmland and was mired in a scandal over opening up the protected Greenbelt to development – defended his record. He said he was cutting red tape and that no government had done more for housing. ""They don’t want to build,"" Mr. Ford said of his opponents. ""They want to tax people to death, that’s what they believe in."" He took aim at Ms. Crombie, saying Mississauga shrunk in population on her watch and that she had raised taxes. (The Liberal platform calls for exempting first-time home buyers, seniors and non-profits from land-transfer taxes and cutting the development fees municipalities charge builders.) Ms. Stiles said the PC government had allowed rents to shoot ""through the roof"" across the province, especially in the north and said an NDP government would get back in the business of building affordable housing. ""Where are the houses? Where are the homes that Doug Ford said he was going to build? Where are the homes, Doug?"" the NDP Leader asked. ""He has not done a dang thing about it."" 3) Addiction and homelessness The debate’s tone changed as the leaders discussed the opioid overdose crisis and homelessness. Ms. Crombie shared the story of her biological father, who suffered from mental health and addiction issues and left her family when she was young. Mr. Ford also alluded to his family’s struggles. His brother Rob’s tumultuous term as Toronto’s mayor was plagued by his drug and alcohol use. The other leaders accused the PC government of doing too little to help with homelessness and drug addiction. ""On this issue, I have got to tell you, my priority is taking care of people,"" Ms. Stiles said. ""Some of the people on this stage are going to just want to throw people into jail."" Mr. Ford, who has pledged to strengthen police powers to clear encampments, also defended his move to shut down supervised injection sites near schools or daycares and instead fund centres he says will funnel people into treatment. ""I know no one wants a drug-addiction site beside a school or a daycare. But my three folks here, on the stage, they voted against that,"" Mr. Ford said, as Ms. Crombie muttered ""no, we didn’t."" The Liberals in fact supported the PC bill when it passed in December. 4) Affordability The opposition leaders took aim at Mr. Ford for the affordability crisis in Ontario, saying housing prices are among the highest in the world and that families are struggling. Mr. Ford turned the conversation back to the economy, saying he’s never raised taxes. He attacked Ms. Crombie, calling her the ""queen of the carbon tax,"" despite her previous comments saying she doesn’t support consumer carbon pricing. 5) Memorable lines ""Mr. Schreiner, he won’t cut down a dandelion to put the shovels in the ground. He just won’t do it."" – Mr. Ford on his view that his opponents, including the Green Party Leader, don’t believe in building homes or infrastructure. ""You talk a good tale and you sound kind of folksy and charming, but none of what you’re saying is actually true."" – Ms. Crombie on Mr. Ford’s pledges to end hallway health care, cut income taxes or build 1.5 million homes. ""It’s outrageous, these two fighting over who built the least housing in Ontario."" – Ms. Stiles on Mr. Ford and Ms. Crombie squabbling over their records. ""I’m going to invite you canoeing and kayaking so you too can explore the beautiful north, Premier. It’s beautiful up here."" – Ms. Crombie, during a segment on the north’s forestry industry. ""Nobody in Ontario, when housing should be a human right, should be homeless tonight."" – Mr. Schreiner.

""If they focus on Carney, more Canadians will be thinking ‘Hey, maybe I should take a look at this Carney guy.’"" Mr. Poilievre has a major ""Canada First"" rally planned for Saturday in Ottawa as he pivots from mostly talking about carbon pricing to defending the country from Mr. Trump. The Conservative Leader needs to lay out clearly how he would deal with Mr. Trump and not just rely on clever slogans and photo ops, Mr. Nanos said ""For Poilievre, he has to be more than just a cheerleader for Canadian patriotism, Canadians want to hear details. They want to know what would be his approach, tone and strategy to dealing with Donald Trump,"" he said. Mr. Scheer suggested that mainstream media were going easy on Mr. Carney and failing to ask him tough questions even though he ""is about become prime minister because a small group of Liberal party members are going to install him."" Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett said Mr. Carney needs to be pressed on his corporate financial interests while also advising Prime Minister Trudeau on economic policy. ""It’s unbelievable that this guy has provided no transparency whatsoever about what his financial interests are,"" he said. ""Mark Carney has been in witness protection and hasn’t answered a lot of questions."" When the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England stepped into the political arena, he resigned from a number of executive, board and advisory positions, which made him an influential and well-paid figure in the corporate world. As a leadership candidate with no seat in the House of Commons, Mr. Carney is not subject to the rules governing conflicts of interest that apply to MPs and public office holders. That means he is not required to take specific steps to manage potential conflicts during the leadership contest, such as placing assets he earned in his corporate career in a blind trust. If Mr. Carney wins the leadership race and becomes prime minister, however, he would then be subject to the Conflict of Interest Act, and he could be subject to the Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House of Commons if he wins a seat in a federal election. He would have to put his assets in a blind trust. Mr. Carney served as chair of both private media and finance company Bloomberg LP and Brookfield Asset Management, which controls about $1-trillion in assets globally. He had also sat on the boards of Stripe, a financial-services firm, and had an advisory role with investment firm PIMCO. He was also the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance; and a member of Harvard University’s board of overseers.

FIRST READING: Carney is having a polling honeymoon ... just like Kim Campbell and John Turner,2025.0,"First Reading is a daily newsletter keeping you posted on the travails of Canadian politicos, all curated by the National Post's own Tristin Hopper. To get an early version sent directly to your inbox, sign up here TOP STORY With a shocking new poll showing that Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is poised to win a general election against Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, he may be experiencing a phenomenon that would be familiar to two other ill-starred politicians in similar circumstances. Twice in the past 40 years, an unpopular federal government has shuffled in a new leader at the last minute tasked with immediately leading it into a general election. And in both cases, the new leader enjoyed a brief honeymoon of wild popularity before ultimately leading their party into electoral oblivion. John Turner was a Liberal prime minister for just 79 days before being on the receiving end of a devastating 1984 landslide victory by the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney. Kim Campbell had a Progressive Conservative premiership of 132 days before suffering a 1993 defeat in which her party lost 154 of its 156 seats. Both Turner and Campbell had taken over from long-term incumbents who had been driven out of office by spiralling unpopularity. And when both took the helm, polls showed them to be extremely popular and likely to win a general election. Newly elected Liberal leader John Turner in the visitor's gallery of the House of Commons in 1984. Like Mark Carney, he wasn't an MP when contesting the leadership. In Campbell's case, she was briefly one of the most popular Canadian prime ministers in history. Two months after her June 1993 swearing-in, a Gallup poll showed Campbell with an approval rating of 51 per cent against just 22 per cent who disapproved. That may not sound like much, but it's miraculously high for a job in which approval ratings frequently dwell in the low 40s. In the entire nine-year tenure of Justin Trudeau, there's only been a few months in which he could boast of a similar 29-point spread between approval and disapproval. At the time, Campbell's 51 per cent was the highest recorded for a prime minister in 30 years. It's all the more remarkable given that Campbell was taking over from a prime minister, Mulroney, whose disapproval rating had reached a record-breaking 83 per cent before his departure. For the first months of Campbell's time in the PMO, news coverage was mostly about how everyone liked her. Colby Cosh: What makes Trump's aluminum tariffs especially crazy? We're the only game in town 'Canada 51st state' hats for sale on Amazon spark outrage among Canadians In July 1993 - just three months before the election that would destroy her party - Campbell was easily polling as the country's most popular choice for prime minister. A Gallup poll asked Canadians if they'd rather have Campbell or then Liberal Leader Jean Chretien as prime minister; 40 per cent said Campbell, with just 23 per cent saying Chretien. Reporters spoke of ""Kimmanie"" - an overnight mania for the new Progressive Conservative leader in Quebec. When the writs for the 1993 election were eventually dropped, frustrated letter-writers bemoaned how quickly Kim-crazed Canadians seemed to have forgotten their distaste of the party that Campbell represented. ""Have we such short memories that we forget she was part of the Mulroney government that everyone loved to hate?"" read a September 1993 letter to the Hamilton Spectator. ""Let's be honest, what has Kim Campbell done to deserve this popularity?"" Chretien at the time confidently called Campbell's popularity a ""mirage."" ""She wants a different image, but the (Tory) economic policies will remain the same,"" he said. Campbell herself even seemed to be skeptical of her brief and ultimately doomed honeymoon with voters. When asked why polls were showing her to be so beloved, she cheekily answered, ""when the polls are good, then they're very serious and accurate reflections of what the public think. When they're not good, they are simply but mere transitory reflections of ephemeral moods not to be taken seriously."" Kim Campbell pictured on Sept. 8, 1993 after asking the Governor General to dissolve parliament. At the time, Canada was entering an election that favoured her to win. Her and Chretien's skepticism may have been fuelled by the fact that Canada was only nine years removed from a similar honeymoon with Turner that also led to disaster. Much as Carney has polled for years as the preferred successor for Justin Trudeau, Turner had been the preferred alternative to then Liberal Leader Pierre Trudeau since at least the 1970s. Polls from the time showed that if Turner had been prime minister in 1979, the Liberals would likely not have lost the election to Joe Clark. As such, when Turner finally got the job in 1984, polls immediately started showing a surprise boost for the Liberals. A Gallup poll conducted during the Liberal leadership race was said to have ""shocked the nation"" by showing the party with a six-point lead - an unbelievable turnaround for a party that had spent years scraping new depths of unpopularity under the elder Trudeau. When Turner called a federal election shortly after his June 30 swearing-in, he enjoyed a comfortable lead. Three separate pollsters gave his Liberals a 10-point advantage over the Progressive Conservatives; more than enough for Turner to win a majority. But as would happen with Campbell, the refreshing change of a new face in the Prime Minister's Office would dissolve almost immediately once voters remembered the party and policies he represented. For Turner, his popularity would never recover after a moment in the English-language leaders' debate in which he appeared to defend an 11th hour wave of patronage appointments made by the outgoing Pierre Trudeau. After Turner said he ""had no option"" to cancel the unpopular appointments, Mulroney famously responded ""you had an option, sir."" The phrase now has its own Wikipedia page, which should indicate how badly it went for Turner. IN OTHER NEWS Former prime minister Stephen Harper was in the news last month saying that U.S. President Donald Trump's threats against Canada didn't make a lot of sense and had ""shocked"" him with their lack of any grounding in fact. And now, at an event this week promoting his new book, Harper said he would ""accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country."" ""I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" he told a crowd in Ottawa. Harper's new book is about flags The Liberal leadership race is effectively consolidating around Mark Carney; he's gotten virtually all of the race's major endorsements.

Poilievre moves further away from Sask. base,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre once appeared to be leading a federal version of the Saskatchewan Party. The leader of Canada's Conservative Party received unprecedented support in his 2022 campaign to become leader of the Official Opposition from 21 Saskatchewan government MLAs - more than three times all other elected provincial officials in Canada who endorsed Poilievre. Those backing Poilievre included six current cabinet ministers in Premier Scott Moe's government: Ken Cheveldayoff, Daryl Harrison, Terry Jenson, Travis Keisig, Tim McLeod and Colleen Young. As unusual as it is for provincial politicians to endorse any federal leader, Poilievre seemed in sync with Saskatchewan's long-serving conservative government: eager to eliminate the carbon tax and dismantle regulations to address climate change, and willing to blame any and all ills on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. But appealing only to right- wing voters in Saskatchewan will fail to deliver enough votes to win a federal election in Canada. And a rapidly changing political landscape since the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States has severely tested Poilievre's ability to pivot, as it would any politician so invested in his core message. Poilievre will never get his cherished carbon tax election with the deeply unpopular Trudeau as his main opponent. Trudeau is leaving and the consumer carbon tax can be reliably declared dead with his likely successors as Liberal leader pledging to abandon it. Trump has proved himself in less than a month leading America as a much bigger threat to Canada and Saskatchewan than Trudeau and the carbon tax. So Poilievre has adjusted his campaign accordingly. But that shift appears to be putting distance between him and his Saskatchewan base, at least judging by the comments from both Poilievre and Moe. Moe has taken a different path from most Canadian political leaders with timid talk about trying to pacify Trump, despite all the evidence that the former reality TV star makes capricious decisions with incoherent rationale. Meanwhile, the prevailing theme from Canada has been to fight back against Trump's tariffs with countermeasures. Whether or not Moe's milquetoast messaging reflects the province's people, it seems a stark departure from the tough-guy image Moe tried to cultivate as someone willing to fight for Saskatchewan against the Trudeau government at every turn. Contrast that with Poilievre's response to 25 per cent American tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum - including from Canada - as he quickly called this week for matching tariffs on Canadian imports of the same products from the U.S. Poilievre, who has spent much of his time as leader deriding Canada as ""broken"" to an apparently receptive audience tired of Trudeau, appeared Tuesday on social media urging Canadians to fly the flag to show their patriotism. That represents a novel tactic for someone who embraced the truckers' convoy that used the flag as a divisive symbol. Moe has cautioned against taking seriously Trump's musings about Canada becoming the 51st American state, while Poilievre told the Toronto Sun this month that he's ""always taken it seriously."" Like Stephen Harper before him, Poilievre is willing to abandon his supportive Saskatchewan base to pursue votes elsewhere in order to gain power. And it's not just a Trump-inspired change in trajectory. Poilievre likely senses a change in Liberal leaders will soften his support. Late last month, Saskatchewan's government applied for intervener status in a court challenge by Newfoundland and Labrador to the federal equalization formula, which successive provincial governments have felt shortchanges the Land of the Living Skies (although Moe's predecessor, Brad Wall, dropped a similar lawsuit back in 2008 with the friendlier Harper government in Ottawa). But Poilievre, in a French language interview last month, said he does not ""anticipate big changes"" to the equalization formula if elected prime minister.

John Ivison: It will be Carney vs. Poilievre. And neither has a clear advantage,2025.0,"The Liberal leadership race is effectively over and the 2025 Canadian general election just got a lot more interesting. As with swallows and summers, one poll does not define any political contest. But any Liberals who decide to vote for anyone other than Mark Carney after Leger's latest survey might as well form a circular firing squad. The poll suggested that the Conservative lead across the country has been whittled down to nine points from 18 points during the firm's last survey. Leger has Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives at 40 per cent support, compared to 31 per cent for the Liberals. However, Liberal support rises to 37 per cent when respondents were asked to consider Carney as leader, while the number of Conservative voters slips into a statistical dead heat. (Given the inefficiency of a Conservative vote heavily concentrated in the West, that would likely see the Liberals re-elected.) The bad news for Chrystia Freeland's leadership campaign is that with her as leader, Liberal support declines to 28 per cent and the Conservatives maintain a strong lead at 38 per cent. Liberal party members would have to be pretty dumb to ignore such obvious signals from the electorate, and when it comes to holding on to power, Liberals are not dumb. As mentioned, this is just one poll but the trendlines are supported by others. It is an exceptional turnaround in public sentiment, but we are living in a singular moment. When Justin Trudeau resigned just last month, most polling firms had the Conservatives ahead by more than 20 percentage points. Yet, Poilievre's lead has always been predicated on deep enmity towards Trudeau, rather than an affection for the Conservative leader. Abacus Data polls consistently revealed that around one-third of those who said they supported Poilievre were parking their vote and could be persuaded to change their minds if a better alternative came along. For many of those people, Carney seems like the right person at the right time. The Leger poll suggests that eight out of 10 Canadians are concerned President Donald Trump will use tariffs to pressure Canada into a closer union with the U.S. Poilievre's ""axe the tax"" mantra resonates less loudly against the backdrop of potential annexation. The Conservative leader and Carney are in a statistical tie when it comes to being trusted to deal with Trump. But Carney has a clear advantage when it comes to experience in major crises. (I disclose, as I have before, that I have been friends with Carney for more than a decade.) The Conservatives have millions of dollars to paint the presumptive Liberal leader as ""Carbon Tax Carney"" or to denigrate his role as governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England. But the facts remain: Carney was in the Cash Room at the U.S. Treasury in October 2008 with the other G7 finance ministers and central bankers when the decision was taken to backstop the banking system with liquidity to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression. He was chair of the Financial Stability Board, the international body that cleaned up the mess in the wake of the financial crisis. And he was the governor of the Bank of England who warned that Brexit would weaken the pound, undermine investment, lead to higher unemployment and cripple economic growth. (A 2021 report by the U.K. Office of Budget Responsibility calculated that Brexit will cost Britain four per cent of GDP per annum going forward or $57 billion a year). Against that, Poilievre's resume is, let's say, one-dimensional. The Conservative leader also sounds almost Trumpian in his rhetoric, in a way that could harm his cause with potential switch voters. That's not to suggest that he subscribes to Trump's delusional mercantilism or casual corruption. But in his Arctic security announcement this week, he talked of ""dramatically cutting foreign aid."" At a time when Trump is discarding allies, surely it would pay to do the opposite: to assert the value of soft power in the battle to win friends and influence people. Poilievre's sympathies are often too narrow for many voters who are not fully invested in his project. How many people were cheering him on this week, when he tweeted out that Carney was wearing $2,000 Zegna sneakers during a photo op? If there was ever a time to put away childish things, it is now. At the same time, Carney has baggage - not least the Liberal brand. Poilievre had a point when he said that the team of Trudeau ministers who are now backing Carney not only endorsed his agenda, they helped write it, push it and implement it. ""Keeping Trudeau's team is the same as keeping Trudeau."" The mere sight of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault endorsing Carney was probably enough for many Poilievre waverers to stiffen their spines. The sense that the Liberals need to be consigned to the penalty box remains strong and may be a decisive factor in the coming election. Then there is Carney himself. His defining mission in recent years has been climate action and it was telling that his first policy commitment was a plan that would dump the consumer carbon tax he says is now too divisive and replace it with a new approach that relies on financial incentives for appliances, cars and insulation. He would tighten existing output-based carbon regimes that regulate heavy emitters to avoid credit oversupply, though since those programs are run by the provinces it is not clear how he would do that. He would make investments in electrified transportation and develop a carbon-based adjustment mechanism - loosely, tariffs on countries that don't take climate action, to avoid ""carbon leakage."" It is a fairly modest plan. But the fact that it was his first priority is the problem. He has been vague, for example, about whether he is in favour of building pipelines east and west to diversify the customer base for our energy. Frankly, people have more immediate concerns, such as the president of the United States saying he wants to annex their country and plans to squeeze them economically until they submit to his will. If Trump follows through, as it appears he has every intention of doing, Canada's emissions growth will cease to be a problem because there will be no growth of any kind. The Leger poll suggests nearly nine in 10 Canadians are worried, if not stressed about it. The only source of consolation is that a roughly equal number say they feel pride in being Canadian, a significant increase on the number who said the same the last time the question was asked nearly a year ago. Carney has talked about us being masters in our own house; Poilievre has promised he will build a self-reliant, sovereign nation. The only way out of this mess is to choose a national leader who is resolute in defence of Canada, who is prepared to safeguard its economy and who is willing to use its natural resources to benefit all Canadians. The next election will be a contest to decide who is best positioned to do that job.

'Any level of damage': How far Stephen Harper would go to keep an independent Canada,2025.0,"Stephen Harper told a crowd in Ottawa Tuesday that if he were still prime minister, he would accept ""any level of damage"" to Canada, rather than see it join the United States as the 51st state. ""I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" Harper said. The former prime minister was speaking before an invitation-only crowd to promote his new book, Flags of Canada, about the history of the Canadian flag. But, given the drama of Donald Trump's tariff threats against Canada and his now-repeated musings about Canada becoming the 51st state, Harper couldn't avoid touching on current affairs, according to a report in the Toronto Star. ""Now, because I do think that if Trump were determined, he could really do wide structural and economic damage, but I wouldn't accept that,"" said Harper, according to the Star. ""I would accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country."" In recent weeks, Trump's rhetoric around Canada and Mexico has escalated. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was recently caught on a hot mic saying that he believes Trump's comments about annexing Canada - which he initially suggested was a joke over dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago - are ""a real thing."" At the moment, Canada and the United States are in a bit of a holding pattern over tariffs. A 30-day pause agreed to last week was upended earlier this week when Trump announced 25-per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminium effective March 12. The across-the-board U.S. tariffs could come into effect on March 4, if Canada's plan to step up border security doesn't pacify the president. Harper, who now runs a consultancy, said that while he was willing to impoverish Canada to maintain its independence, it would also be critical to have a plan to rebuild the country's economy. The vast majority of Canadian trade goes to our southern neighbour. ""Important in that is to have a plan of how we would reorient our economy, so we would recover that prosperity again, and not just solve the damage,"" Harper said. Since his defeat in 2015, Harper has rarely commented on Canadian public affairs. When he has spoken to the media - fewer than a half-dozen times in the past near-decade - it has often been to U.S. news podcasts, including in January when he shellacked Trudeau to a Florida podcaster and expressed shock at the way Trump has treated its closest ally. Harper also recently joined the four other living former prime ministers - Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin - to implore Canadians to fly the Canadian flag this Saturday, the 60th anniversary of its adoption. ""In the face of threats and insults from Donald Trump, Canadians have come together to express their love for our country and their determination to defend Canada's values and our independence,"" the five former leaders wrote. ""As former prime ministers of Canada, we applaud this national spirit. And we call on our fellow Canadians to show the flag as never before."" In fact, in Ottawa Tuesday, Harper did commend Trudeau for his patriotic fervour in the face of the Trump threats, the Star reported. Harper was speaking at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society office in Ottawa to promote his new book, which will be published Feb. 25. Harper spoke about how Canada had evolved from using the Union Jack and the Red Ensign before engaging in an intense debate under Lester B. Pearson to adopt the current Canadian flag.

Poilievre revives 'use it or lose it' Arctic plan,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre's announcement in Iqaluit that a Conservative government would build a permanent military base in the Arctic, and order two more heavy icebreakers, had deliberate echoes with the defence policy of his predecessor as leader, Stephen Harper. Nearly 20 years ago, Harper grafted onto an issue that was considered a curiosity by his opponents: militarizing the Canadian Arctic. Canada had a choice -- when it came to defending its sovereignty in the North: ""either we use it or lose it,"" he said on one of his annual trips to the region in 2007. His government intended to ""use it"" and indicated a ""real, growing, long-term presence"" in the Arctic by announcing plans to refurbish a deepwater port on a former mining site at Nanisivik in Nunavut in addition to ordering up to eight ""icecapable"" Arctic patrol ships. While five of the patrol ships have been delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy by Irving Shipyards in Halifax, not much remains of Harper's legacy project. Nanisivik, which was meant to open in 2015, is a decade behind schedule, and the enthusiasm for ""using"" the North waned, as other priorities emerged. But Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine shook the Trudeau government's sense of complacency. ""What was a relatively benign threat suddenly became an existential threat,"" said Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, a retired Royal Canadian Navy officer and ex-vice-chief of the defence staff. As Poilievre put it, our safety and trade with the United States requires that Canada control its North. Given the noises being made by President Donald Trump, who said on Sunday that Canada can no longer depend on the U.S. for military protection, Poilievre's timing was impeccable. The reality is that Ottawa has already awoken from a decade of slumber when it comes to the Arctic. The defence policy update released last year - Our North, Strong and Free - redirected Can ada's focus from expeditionary ventures overseas to defending the homeland. Norman said that represented a major cultural shift for the military, which had for decades concentrated almost exclusively on large expeditionary capabilities as part of NATO. The Trudeau government had already reached agreement with the Biden administration to contribute $29 billion over 20 years to modernize the North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad), paying for two of six Arctic radar installations and building infrastructure such as hangars and runways to allow the new F-35 fighter jet fleet to operate in the North. Defence Minister Bill Blair has committed to up to 12 submarines to replace the four aging Victoria-class subs and has mused about the need to develop underwater surveillance capabilities in the Arctic (without attaching any funding to either project). At last July's NATO summit, Canada, the U.S. and Finland agreed to collaborate on the production of polar icebreakers. Canada already has orders in place for two icebreakers for the coast guard. Poilievre's commitment would be in addition to those. He has promised to make the existing facility in Iqaluit into a permanent military base, allowing the new P-8 Poseidon surveillance aircraft to operate from there. The Conservative leader further said he would double the number of Canadian Rangers who are active in the North. The commitments would be paid for by making ""drastic""cutsinforeignaid-a promise he should reconsider in light of the Trump administration's funding freeze for USAID. Even maintaining aid budgets would purchase Canada a great deal of goodwill around the world in these ungenerous times. The problem with many of Canada's pledges of new equipment in the North is that the Russians and Chinese may have taken advantage of their absence by the time they are delivered. Russia has established Arctic deepwater ports, complete with military icebreakers and airfields with SU-34 bombers. It has also submitted documentation with the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf that essentially claims the entire Arctic Ocean. China has three icebreakers already operating in the Arctic, in co-operation with the Russians, and the two countries have signed a joint communiqué to develop shipping routes and polar ship technology. Canada's hold on the Arctic is, in the words of former defence chief Wayne Eyre, ""tenuous"" - and it is like - ly to become more so with Trump in office. In his first term in office, Trump proposed buying Greenland and dismissed as illegitimate Canada's claim that the Northwest Passage is an internal waterway. The language Trump is using has provoked a visceral reaction in Canada. ""Why are we protecting another country?"" he asked on Fox News on Sunday. But, as Norman points out, the president is calling for this country to do what it should have done a long time ago. ""When you take your foot off the gas, you run out of momentum. Now we find ourselves legitimately called out for our lack of commitment and action."" He said the moves Poilievre announced are steps in the right direction. Iqaluit is a pre-existing hub, even if it is a long way from the Far North and has a shallow port. ""It's the best of a not-great set of options,"" Norman said. ""(But) we have to act strategically, like a serious country."" The consequences of not doing so would leave Canada exposed. Norman said he is concerned that Trump might take a wrecking ball to Norad, in the same manner he has disrupted so many other arrangements. That would leave this country scrambling to create its own capabilities. We are a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan visited Ottawa in 1987 and Brian Mulroney raised the issue of U.S. encroachment in the Northwest Passage. An accord was eventually reached under which the U.S. agreed to ask permission and Canada agreed to say yes. Such co-operation seems almost quaint in today's antagonistic environment. But there are good reasons why the U.S. and Canada are natural allies in continental defence. ""The reality is, we're the buffer between them and the Russians, and we've used that to our advantage,"" Norman said. ""This is not about American generosity, it's about a legitimate sense of military practicality."" If Canada's claims in the region are backed with hard power, Trump should be as placated as he is ever going to be.

"Fight annexation by U.S. at all costs, Harper tells crowd:   Ex-PM welcomes surge in nationalism",2025.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump's annexation threats should be met with determination to preserve this country's independence at any cost, says former prime minister Stephen Harper. Speaking Tuesday in Ottawa at the launch of his latest history book, ""Flags of Canada,"" Harper welcomed a surge in Canadian nationalism including, he said, from the current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Harper, co-founder of the federal Conservative Party of Canada who now runs a business and investment consulting firm, said he has lately told business people seeking advice about ""what we do about the current situation"" that ""there is real risk here, and real opportunity also"" in Trump's threats, adding he hoped Canadians ""share my view."" ""And if I was still prime minister, I would be prepared to impoverish the country and not be annexed, if that was the option we're facing,"" Harper said to an invitation-only audience. ""Now, because I do think that if Trump were determined, he could really do wide structural and economic damage, but I wouldn't accept that,"" Harper said. ""I would accept any level of damage to preserve the independence of the country. ""Important in that is to have a plan of how we would reorient our economy, so we would recover that prosperity again, and not just solve the damage,"" he added. Harper, whose book and presentation outlined the evolution of Canada's modern maple leaf flag, emphasized that ""our history, our identity and our cultures are worth preserving."" Harper's remarks, which prompted enthusiastic applause, came the day after Trump signed an executive order to slap 25 per cent tariffs on global imports of steel and aluminum, including from Canada, effective March 12. Trudeau calls the tariffs ""unjustified,"" and vows Canada will respond if it comes to that. Trump's other massive threat - a 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian products, with a lower 10 per cent surcharge on energy - still hangs over this country, temporarily delayed as Ottawa tries to persuade the U.S. president the tariffs will hurt American consumers and businesses first and foremost. Harper did not comment directly on the tariff threats, or whether or how Canada should retaliate, but the Trudeau government has vowed that ""all options"" are on the table when it comes to its response to the U.S. During a question-and-answer session, the former prime minister said he doesn't often ""weigh in"" on national affairs, but he did not avoid the political elephant in the room: Trump's talk of making Canada a 51st state, which the U.S. president has repeatedly and insistently raised in public and in private. The outbreak of nationalism and patriotism it has sparked north of the border has even reframed the political discourse in the Liberal leadership race to replace Trudeau, and the broader strategy of the Opposition Conservatives. Harper is one of five former prime ministers who signed a joint statement released Tuesday to ""applaud"" the ""national spirit"" shown by Canadians in the face of Trump's ""threats and insults."" ""We call on our fellow Canadians to show the flag as never before"" on Saturday, national ""Flag Day"" this year. The former prime ministers, which include Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, Jean Chrétien, Paul Martin and Harper, said ""The five of us come from different parties. We've had our share of battles in the past. But we all agree on one thing: Canada, the true north, strong and free, the best country in the world, is worth celebrating and fighting for."" ""Canadians have never been flag wavers like Americans,"" Harper said Tuesday during his book launch. But, he said, this country has had passionate debates over its flags, starting with the Union Jack, then the Red Ensign, and leading up to the divisive public and political debate over the adoption of the single red maple leaf as the national emblem. For generations, Canadians, particularly anglophones, identified with the country's British heritage, culture, parliamentary and political traditions, Harper said, and as such saw themselves very distinctly as non-American, right up until at least the 1940s. He suggested that strong sense of distinct identity is diminished in younger generations who grew up in an internet age, in a more open world, with more open borders, yet Trump's declarations that he would seek to annex Canada as a 51st state have stirred an unmistakable national pride. Harper's comments, tinged with humorous shots at past political debates, were mainly apolitical, although he did take a few passing pokes at Trudeau, the Liberal leader who beat him, including when he said he was glad to see Trudeau embrace Canadian nationalistic pride. (Trudeau was quoted telling the New York Times in 2015, shortly after he defeated Harper, that, ''There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada."" The American newspaper was the first print media to get a sit-down interview with the then-new prime minister. ''There are shared values - openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first post-national state,'' Trudeau said.) In talking about why John Diefenbaker clung to the Red Ensign for so long even when it was clear that Canadians had an appetite for a new modern national flag, Harper observed that politicians are sometimes reluctant to give up on things they feel are important, noting that Trudeau remains ""passionate"" about a carbon tax, even though his party is ""walking away from it"" - a reference to Trudeau's would-be successors. Leading Liberal candidates Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland have said they would ditch the consumer carbon price policy.

Poilievre pledges to expand Arctic defences,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre vowed to build a new permanent military base in Iqaluit to be called CFB Iqaluit should he become the country's next prime minister, as a way to assert Canada's Arctic sovereignty amid growing threats from Russia and China. ""We cannot count on the Americans to do it for us anymore,"" he said during a press conference in the territorial capital on Monday. Poilievre, who is leading in national polls, said the military base would be built within his first two years as prime minister. His plan would also double the number of the Canadian Rangers to 4,000 and provide four new icebreakers, two for the Canadian Coast Guard and two for the Navy. It would be financed by ""dramatically cutting foreign aid,"" much of which, he said, ""goes to dictators, terrorists and global bureaucracies."" Canada spent about $15.5 billion on international assistance in 202223, and Poilievre's promise follows U.S. President Donald Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. ""The Canadian Arctic is under threat,"" Poilievre said in a video of his plan posted on Monday. ""Hostile powers want our resources, our shipping routes and to be within striking distance of our continent. Our safety, territory and trade with the U.S. requires we take back control of Canada's North."" Poilievre's push is part of a new suite of policies he's dubbing his ""Canada First"" plan, in the face of Trump's tariff threats and his insistence the country should become a U.S. state. Trump cited Arctic security as a reason for his renewed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark. The U.S. president has also long complained about Canada and European countries being laggards when it comes to their defence spending. ""Canada will never be the 51st state. We are a proud, sovereign and independent country,"" Poilievre said. Canada's Arctic makes up about 40 per cent of the country's land mass and 75 per cent of its coastlines. -P ostmedia N ews, with files from Bloomberg","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 11, 2025",Military bases; Prime ministers,,2025-02-11,The Province

The language Trump is using has provoked a visceral reaction in Canada. ""Why are we protecting another country?"" he asked on Fox News on Sunday. But, as Norman points out, the president is calling for this country to do what it should have done a long time ago. ""When you take your foot off the gas, you run out of momentum. Now we find ourselves legitimately called out for our lack of commitment and action."" He said the moves Poilievre announced are steps in the right direction. Iqaluit is a pre-existing hub, even if it is a long way from the Far North and has a shallow port. ""It's the best of a not-great set of options,"" Norman said. ""(But) we have to act strategically, like a serious country."" The consequences of not doing so would leave Canada exposed. Norman said he is concerned that Trump might take a wrecking ball to Norad, in the same manner he has disrupted so many other arrangements. That would leave this country scrambling to create its own capabilities. We are a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan visited Ottawa in 1987 and Brian Mulroney raised the issue of U.S. encroachment in the Northwest Passage. An accord was eventually reached under which the U.S. agreed to ask permission and Canada agreed to say yes. Such co-operation seems almost quaint in today's antagonistic environment. But there are good reasons why the U.S. and Canada are natural allies in continental defence. ""The reality is, we're the buffer between them and the Russians, and we've used that to our advantage,"" Norman said. ""This is not about American generosity, it's about a legitimate sense of military practicality."" If Canada's claims in the region are backed with hard power, Trump should be as placated as he is ever going to be.

Poilievre's therapeutic effect,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has become a lightning rod for Canadians' frustration, and for those seeking cathartic release from simply being a Canadian - whatever that means, what with our ongoing national identity crisis - in 2025. Outside of the Vancouver Wall Centre on the night of Feb. 4, a small crowd of pro-Palestine protesters, including one draped in a ""Queers for Palestine"" flag, huddled and shouted in the snowy, -6 C air. Poilievre was there to speak to a crowd of Conservative party donors inside. Clusters of Vancouver police officers in high-visibility vests kept the disruption outdoors. One protester's sign suggested he was angry at the $1,750 price of admission to the ballroom event, drawing some imponderable connection between conflict in Gaza - now in a tenuous ceasefire - and a Canadian politician raising funds during the pre-election season. As politicians of every stripe do. (My ticket was complimentary, for the record.) Earlier in the day, a different group of protesters chanted about white supremacy and fascism, jeering ""Hey hey, ho ho, Poilievre has got go!"" and ""Hey hey, ho ho, fascism has got to go!"" as he visited Vancouver's Temple Shalom synagogue. One banner read, ""Jews say no to the politics of bigotry and hate."" Whose politics? Poilievre's? To be fair, we now know that those involved in the pro-Palestinian movement will accuse anyone of genocide. These people are mad at everyone with a scintilla of power. Carry on. Back at the Wall Centre, and despite the lively nature of an evening of cocktails, fundraising and politics shared amongst party supporters, the theme of the night was - undeniably - our national malcontent. Poilievre gave an address on his vision for Canada similar to those we have heard in his pressers, podcast appearances and impassioned speeches on the floor of Parliament. His tone was more intimate and casual, however, as though he was surrounded by friends. He said he wanted an election ""yesterday."" Ask NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh when it will be, he told the crowd. ""Maybe donate all the money from the fundraiser to his pension so that he can call the election earlier."" He also used the night to share a policy announcement he would give the public the next day: life in prison for fentanyl kingpins. It sounded like the political promise of a Central American leader during Richard Nixon's War on Drugs. But no, half-a-century on, it's just a pledge that resonates with Canadians weary from hearing about opioid overdose deaths and fed up with the public health officials pushing ""harm reduction"" policies. The night's question-and-answer period felt as though it was part therapy session. One man, Jas Arora of Abbotsford, B.C., nervously blurted out some of the details of his saga as a business owner and victim of an extortion gang that the RCMP created a task force to investigate nearly one year ago. ""My mom passed away and I asked the police to attend (the funeral hall) because they were threatening to kill my kids,"" he stammered. I spoke to Arora earlier in the night, and he told me his adult children left Canada because they do not feel safe here. He didn't have a question for Poilievre so much as a requiem for the country he thought Canada could have been - and should have been - for his children. Another man, pointing to his cane, told the crowd he sat on a waitlist for nearly two years before receiving necessary medical care. After Poilievre gave his canned answer on fixing health care, he shared a joke: ""They say that if you have a heart attack, don't call 911, call a taxi - 'cause the driver's prob - ably a doctor."" If you don't laugh, you'll cry. Others had similar questions. What about tuition costs? Bureaucrats strangling small businesses with red tape? Our devalued currency? All anxieties and frustrations, and even disbelief, about the country we are all standing in. The night was a release of energy with nowhere else to go. Where is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau? He's hiding and on his way out. Those ""F--k Trudeau"" flags just don't provide the same dopamine hit they used to. Singh? Irrelevant. And then there is the Chrystia Freeland or Mark Carney sideshow of shameful vanity and capriciousness. Neither make good targets for a purge of our pent-up Canad-anger. (Canad-anger: it's like the ""hangry,"" portmanteau of hungry and angry, but instead it means we are mad at the dismal state of our country.) Are these two really in the midst of their own personal marketing campaigns while the country hovers on the brink of a trade war with our ""best friend"" and the largest economy in the world - selling themselves to a populace that largely doesn't want them? And then there's Poilievre. Whether you love or hate him, need to yell and scream and shout at him, or sing his praises once you've calmed down - he's our guy, appar - ently.

Poilievre vows to cut foreign aid:   Pledges new military base and equipment in the Arctic: 'We've got our own backyard to protect',2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Monday that he would massively cut foreign aid to pay for a new military base in the Arctic, two new heavy icebreakers and double the number of Canadian Rangers who patrol the north where China and Russia are seen as a growing strategic threat. The promises were part of a new plan to bolster Canada's military presence in the Arctic, which Poilievre pledged to pay for through deep - but unspecified - cuts to the current Liberal government's foreign assistance budget. ""We've got enough problems at home. We've got our own backyard to protect. We can't be sending billions of dollars to other places, often ... much of it is wasted, and stolen and swallowed up by bureaucracies that act against our interests,"" Poilievre told reporters in Iqaluit. The federal government spent more than $15.5 billion on foreign aid in the 2022-23 fiscal year, according to the most recent figures from the Global Affairs department. Poilievre alleged that ""a lot"" of Canada's aid money goes to ""dictators, terrorists and global bureaucracies"" - a claim he has expressed previously when calling for cuts to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, which Israel has accused of including personnel with links to Hamas terrorists, as well as any funding for the China-based Asian Infrastructure Bank. ""I will be bringing our money home with massive cuts to these wasteful and corrupt foreign aid grants,"" the Conservative leader said Monday. Spokespeople for International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen and Defence Minister Bill Blair did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Poilievre unveiled his new military plan for the Arctic from the tarmac of the Iqaluit airport, where he cited China and Russia as competing powers with eyes on the region - a concern shared by upper ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces and the current Liberal government. He cited China's 2018 declaration that it is a ""near-Arctic"" state with interests in the north, as well as Russia's military presence in its own Arctic, as growing threats. The Conservative leader - who stood behind a lectern adorned with a large blue ""Canada First"" placard - also said ""our safety, territory, and trade with the U.S. requires that we take back control of our north."" Billed as the first part of a broader plan for the region, Poilievre pledged to build ""at least"" one new Canadian Armed Forces base - the one he detailed Monday would be in Iqaluit - within two years of taking office in an election that will take place this year. He also said he would double the size of the 1st Patrol Group of the Canadian Rangers, a part-time unit that operates across all three territories and in northern British Columbia, from 2,000 to 4,000 personnel. And he would acquire two new polar icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy and deliver the two other icebreakers earmarked for the coast guard - all by 2029. The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) estimated last year that it would cost $8.5 billion to build and acquire the two new coast guard icebreakers. Poilievre also promised to speed up military upgrades planned under the current government, which through its new defence policy update - which committed $8.1 billion over five years - plans to purchase new missiles, build new operational support hubs in the north, and acquire new early warning aircraft to patrol the region, among other things. The Liberal government pledged to spend $38.6 billion from 2022 to 2042 to improve Canada's contribution to the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) that it shares with the U.S., including through the installation of new ""over-the-horizon"" radar stations to replace aging Cold War-era surveillance in the North. Poilievre's plan comes as the federal government and military look to bolster's Canada's presence in the Arctic, which a report from the Department of National Defence warned last fall is ""limited and deteriorating."" Retired Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, now a fellow with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, told the Star that the Conservatives and Liberals are essentially ""arguing over the finer details of how they're going to achieve the level of capability and investment that we should have been arguing over for the last 20 years."" He said siphoning off money from existing foreign aid spending could ""translate into some reasonable infrastructure investments,"" and that it would be possible to have ""initial operating capability"" at the proposed Iqaluit base within Poilievre's two-year timeline, but that it would require more time for the base to be operating at full capacity. In recent months, the federal government has also faced pressure to further ramp up its defence budget and finally hit a long-standing commitment through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to spend at least two per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence. In 2024, Canada spent roughly $41 billion on defence, or 1.37 per cent of GDP, according to NATO estimates published last year, when 23 of the alliance's 32 members hit the two per cent target. The current Liberal government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has said it would hit the two per cent target by 2032. During the leadership contest to replace him, however, candidates have promised to achieve that threshold sooner. Former central banker Mark Carney and former Liberal MP Frank Baylis say they would hit two per cent by 2030, while former finance minister Chrystia Freeland and former House leader Karina Gould have said they would get there by 2027, in part through increasing soldiers' salaries and accelerating military procurement. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have said they would maintain defence spending increases planned under the Liberals, but have not said when they would hit the two per cent target.

John Ivison: Poilievre revives 'use it or lose it' Arctic plan. Hopefully it's not already lost,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre's announcement in Iqaluit that under a Conservative government Canada will build a permanent military base in the Arctic, and order two more heavy icebreakers, had very deliberate echoes with the defence policy of his predecessor as Conservative leader, Stephen Harper. Nearly 20 years ago, Harper grafted onto an issue that was considered a curiosity by his opponents: militarizing the Canadian Arctic. Canada had a choice when it came to defending its sovereignty in the North: ""either we use it or lose it,"" he said on one of his annual trips to the region in 2007. His government intended to ""use it"" and indicated a ""real, growing, long-term presence"" in the Arctic by announcing plans to refurbish a deep-water port on a former mining site at Nanisivik in Nunavut in addition to ordering up to eight ""ice-capable"" Arctic patrol ships. While five of the patrol ships have been delivered to the Royal Canadian Navy by Irving Shipyards in Halifax, not much remains of Harper's legacy project. Nanisivik, which was meant to open in 2015, is a decade behind schedule, and the enthusiasm for ""using"" the North waned, as other priorities emerged. But Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine shook the Trudeau government's sense of complacency. ""What was a relatively benign threat suddenly became an existential threat,"" said Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, a retired Royal Canadian Navy officer and ex-Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff. As Poilievre put it, our safety and trade with the United States requires that Canada control its North. Given the noises being made by President Donald Trump, who said on Sunday that Canada can no longer depend on the U.S. for military protection, Poilievre's timing was impeccable. The reality is that Ottawa has already awoken from a decade of slumber when it comes to the Arctic. The defence-policy update released last year - Our North, Strong and Free - redirected Canada's focus from expeditionary ventures overseas to defending the homeland. Norman said that represented a major cultural shift for the military, which had for decades concentrated almost exclusively on large expeditionary capabilities as part of NATO. The Trudeau government had already reached agreement with the Biden administration to contribute $29 billion over 20 years to modernize the North American Aerospace Defence Command, paying for two of six Arctic radar installations and building infrastructure such as hangars and runways to allow the new F-35 fighter jet fleet to operate in the North. Defence Minister Bill Blair has committed to up to 12 submarines to replace the four aging Victoria-class subs and has mused about the need to develop underwater surveillance capabilities in the Arctic (without attaching any funding to either project). At last July's NATO summit, Canada, the U.S. and Finland agreed to collaborate on the production of polar icebreakers. Canada already has orders in place for two icebreakers for the Coast Guard. Poilievre's commitment would be in addition to those. He has promised to make the existing facility in Iqaluit into a permanent military base, allowing the new Poseidon -8 surveillance aircraft to operate from there. The Conservative leader further said he would double the number of Canadian Rangers who are active in the North. The commitments would be paid for by making ""drastic"" cuts in foreign aid - a promise he should reconsider in light of the Trump administration's funding freeze for USAID. Even maintaining aid budgets would purchase Canada a great deal of goodwill around the world in these ungenerous times. The problem with many of Canada's pledges of new equipment in the North is that the Russians and Chinese may have taken advantage of their absence by the time they are delivered. Russia has established Arctic deep-water ports, complete with military icebreakers and airfields with SU-34 bombers. It has also submitted documentation with the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf that essentially claims the entire Arctic Ocean. China has three icebreakers already operating in the Arctic, in co-operation with the Russians, and the two countries have signed a joint communiqué to develop shipping routes and polar ship technology. Canada's hold on the Arctic is, in the words of former defence chief Wayne Eyre, ""tenuous"" - and it is likely to become more so with Trump in office. In his first term in office, Trump proposed buying Greenland and dismissed as illegitimate Canada's claim that the Northwest Passage is an internal waterway. A Coast Guard icebreaker patrols in the Canadian Arctic in 2010. The language Trump is using has provoked a visceral reaction in Canada. ""Why are we protecting another country?"" he asked on Fox News on Sunday But, as Norman points out, the president is calling for this country to do what it should have done a long time ago. ""When you take your foot off the gas, you run out of momentum. Now we find ourselves legitimately called out for our lack of commitment and action."" He said the moves Poilievre announced are steps in the right direction. Iqaluit is a pre-existing hub, even if it is a long way from the far North and has a shallow port. ""It's the best of a not-great set of options,"" Norman said. ""(But) we have to act strategically, like a serious country."" The consequences of not doing so would leave Canada exposed. Norman said he is concerned that Trump might take a wrecking ball to NORAD, in the same manner he has disrupted so many other existing arrangements. That would leave this country scrambling to create its own capabilities. We are a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan visited Ottawa in 1987 and Brian Mulroney raised the issue of American encroachment in the Northwest Passage. An accord was eventually reached under which the U.S. agreed to ask permission and Canada agreed to say yes. Such co-operation seems almost quaint in today's antagonistic environment. But there are good reasons why the U.S. and Canada are natural allies in continental defence.

"Canada braces for potential steel, aluminum tariffs; Poilievre says U.S. can't be counted on for defence",2025.0,"OTTAWA - The deal that was supposed to delay a Canada-U.S. trade war appeared to be cracking on Monday, as officials watched to see whether President Donald Trump would be making good on his threat of imposing 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While aboard Air Force One on his way to Sunday's Super Bowl, Trump announced he would be unveiling the trade levies Monday and they would include steel and aluminum imports coming from Canada and Mexico. The president was set to begin signing executive orders at 5:30 p.m. ET, according to a report by Fox News. Trump's timing was a situation Canadian officials had hoped to avoid. Exactly one week ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reached an agreement with Trump to delay the U.S's imposition of 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imports, except 10 per cent on energy resources, until early March. Businesses, premiers and anxious Canadians, worried about job losses and rising prices, reacted with relief. Trump and Mexico's President, Claudia Sheinbaum, came to a similar agreement. Speaking in Windsor, Ont., NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh likened the situation to riding a ""roller-coaster."" ""He says there's a 30 day pause, and now he's announced more tariffs,"" he said. Christopher Dummitt: The push Canada needs to achieve true independence Liberal leadership debates set for late February Canada is one of the U.S.'s biggest sources for both steel and aluminum, with Ontario being the biggest steel producer. Quebec is the country's largest aluminum producer. Industry leaders had flashbacks to 2018 when Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on imports of Canadian steel and 10 per cent for aluminum products, which he brought in as Canada, the U.S. and Mexico were locked in negotiations for a revised free trade agreement. ""The reality of crippling tariffs on steel and aluminum is a devastating blow,"" said Sean Strickland, executive director of Canada's Building Trades Unions, representing some 600,000 workers. ""These tariffs aren't just harming our industries - they're undermining our workers' livelihoods and directly threatening Canadian jobs."" The Canadian Steel Producers Association called Trump's threat ""deeply concerning,"" saying the 2018 tariffs ""saw massive disruptions and harm on both sides of the border."" ""While the target of Canadian steel and aluminum is completely baseless and unwarranted, we must retaliate immediately,"" its CEO, Catherine Cobden, said in a statement. ""We are urgently demanding that the Government of Canada act again with resolve and purpose to combat this threat and ensure any measure taken against our sector is met with retaliatory measures and action to offset the devastating impacts tariffs would have on our sector and our workers."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is in Paris attending an event on artificial intelligence, but has said that should the U.S. make good on its threat of imposing tariffs, as Trump has threatened to do on all Canadian imports, the federal government would retaliate. In the wake of Trump's plan to impose 25 per cent universal tariffs, Trudeau announced Canada would slap tariffs on $155-billion of U.S. goods. That plan was shelved after the leaders reached their deal. Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on the Liberals to match the U.S.'s steel and aluminum tariffs, saying all revenue should be sent to the affected industries. Any surplus from tariff revenues should be used to finance a tax break for Canadians, Poilievre said. On Monday, Poilievre announced plans to build a new permanent Arctic military base in Iqaluit to be called CFB Iqaluit should he become the country's next prime minister, as a way to assert Canada's Arctic sovereignty amid growing threats from Russia and China. ""We cannot count on the Americans to do it for us anymore,"" he said during a press conference in the territorial capital. Besides trade, Trump and his officials have long complained about Canada and European countries being laggards when it comes to their defence spending. Poilievre promised on Monday that a future government of his would build the new military base within two years, which he vowed would be financed by ""dramatically cutting foreign aid,"" and he would also provide four new icebreakers, two for the Canadian Coast Guard and two for the Navy. A Conservative government would also double the size of the Canadian Rangers, he said. Poilievre in recent weeks has shifted his message to talking about more Canadian border security and tariffs from speaking over the past two years mainly about the cost of living and scrapping the consumer carbon tax. He also took aim at Trump's repeated comments about Canada becoming the U.S.'s ""51st state,"" which the president reiterated over the weekend. ""Canada will never be the 51st state. We are proud sovereign and independent country."" Singh told reporters in Windsor, Ont., he agrees Canada should reinforce its military presence in the Arctic, saying NDP MP Lori Idlout, the lone member for Nunavut, has raised before. He also promised that should his party form government, it would build a new Canada Border Services Agency training centre to not only create more jobs, but stop guns from entering Canada from the U.S. Trump has said his tariffs against Canada and Mexico were tied to ongoing concerns about the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. Despite announcing several new measures, including a six-year $1.3 billion plan to boost border security and appoint Canada's first fentanyl czar, Canada officials say less than one per cent of the migrants and fentanyl entering the U.S. comes by Canada. Singh said Monday that when it comes to the incoming threat of steel and aluminum tariffs, Canada should respond with ""dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs.""

"Canada braces for potential 25 per cent steel, aluminum tariffs, as Poilievre says U.S. can't be counted on for defence",2025.0,"OTTAWA - The deal that was supposed to delay a Canada-U.S. trade war appeared to be cracking on Monday, as officials watched to see whether President Donald Trump would be making good on his threat of imposing 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While aboard Air Force One on his way to Sunday's Super Bowl, Trump announced he would be unveiling the trade levies Monday and they would include steel and aluminum imports coming from Canada and Mexico. It was a situation Canadian officials had hoped to avoid. Exactly one week ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump reached an agreement to delay the U.S's imposition of 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imports, except 10 per cent on energy resources, until early March. Trump and Mexico's President, Claudia Sheinbaum, came to a similar agreement. Speaking in Windsor, Ont., NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh likened the situation to riding a ""rollercoaster."" ""He says there's a 30 day pause, and now he's announced more tariffs,"" he said. Christopher Dummitt: The push Canada needs to achieve true independence Liberal leadership debates set for late February Canada is one of the U.S.'s biggest sources for both steel and aluminum, with Ontario being the biggest steel producer. Quebec is the country's largest aluminum producer. Industry leaders had flashbacks to 2018 when Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on imports of Canadian steel and 10 per cent for aluminum products, which he brought in as Canada, the U.S. and Mexico were locked in negotiations for a revised free trade agreement. ""The reality of crippling tariffs on steel and aluminum is a devastating blow,"" said Sean Strickland, executive director of Canada's Building Trades Unions, representing some 600,000 workers. ""These tariffs aren't just harming our industries - they're undermining our workers' livelihoods and directly threatening Canadian jobs."" The Canadian Steel Producers Association called Trump's threat ""deeply concerning,"" saying the 2018 tariffs ""saw massive disruptions and harm on both sides of the border."" ""While the target of Canadian steel and aluminum is completely baseless and unwarranted, we must retaliate immediately,"" its CEO, Catherine Cobden, said in a statement. ""We are urgently demanding that the Government of Canada act again with resolve and purpose to combat this threat and ensure any measure taken against our sector is met with retaliatory measures and action to offset the devastating impacts tariffs would have on our sector and our workers."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is currently in Paris attending an event on artificial intelligence, but has said that should the U.S. make good on its threat of imposing tariffs, as Trump has threatened to do on all Canadian imports, the federal government would retaliate. In the wake of Trump's plan to impose 25 per cent universal tariffs, Trudeau announced Canada would slap tariffs on $155-billion of U.S. goods. That plan was shelved after the leaders reached their deal. Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on the Liberals to match the U.S.'s steel and aluminum tariffs, saying all revenue should be sent to the affected industries. Any surplus from tariff revenues should be used to finance a tax break for Canadians, Poilievre said. On Monday, Poilievre announced plans to build a new permanent Arctic military base in Iqaluit to be called CFB Iqaluit should he become the country's next prime minister, as a way to assert Canada's Arctic sovereignty amid growing threats from Russia and China. ""We cannot count on the Americans to do it for us anymore,"" he said during a press conference in the territorial capital. Besides trade, Trump and his officials have long complained about Canada and European countries being laggards when it comes to their defence spending. Poilievre promised on Monday that a future government of his would build the new military base within two years, which he vowed would be financed by ""dramatically cutting foreign aid,"" and he would also provide four new icebreakers, two for the Canadian Coast Guard and two for the Navy. A Conservative government would also double the size of the Canadian Rangers, he said. Poilievre in recent weeks has shifted his message to talking about more Canadian border security and tariffs from speaking over the past two years mainly about the cost of living and scrapping the consumer carbon tax. He also took aim at Trump's repeated comments about Canada becoming the U.S.'s ""51st state,"" which the president reiterated over the weekend. ""Canada will never be the 51st state. We are proud sovereign and independent country."" Singh told reporters in Windsor, Ont., he agrees Canada should reinforce its military presence in the Arctic, saying NDP MP Lori Idlout, the lone member for Nunavut, has raised before. As for the threat of steel and aluminum tariffs, Singh said Canada should respond with ""dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs."" ""That is a type of fight that we have to bring to defend our country, to defend our workers. And then, on top of that, I want supports in place for the workers impacted - in this case, starting with steel and aluminum - but we need a package in place for all the workers and all the sectors that might be impacted,"" Singh said.

Poilievre promises to build new Arctic military base amid growing concerns over Canadian sovereignty,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is promising to build a new military base in Canada's Arctic to bolster its security against threats from China and Russia. Poilievre unveiled the announcement during a press conference on Monday in Iqaluit and in a slickly produced video released earlier in the day. It comes as Poilievre, who for the past two years has been prosecuting the Liberal government's record on the cost of living, is shifting his focus to Canadian security at a time when Canadians are also becoming increasingly concerned about statements made by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become a ""51st state"" and on Sunday promised to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum entering the U.S., including from Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is currently in Paris attending an event on artificial intelligence, but has said that should the U.S. make good on its threat of imposing tariffs, as Trump has threatened to do on all Canadian imports, the federal government would retaliate.

Doug Ford heads to Washington during Ontario election campaign amid tariff threats:   The PC leader will visit the U.S. Capitol in his capacity as Premier less than three weeks before provincial election,2025.0,"Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford will travel to Washington, D.C., Tuesday to meet with U.S. lawmakers in a bid to promote the Canada-U.S. relationship amid the threat of economically devastating tariffs from the Trump administration. Mr. Ford is travelling to the U.S. Capitol in his capacity as premier during the provincial campaign, in an unusual detour for a politician seeking re-election. Mr. Ford, who chairs the Council of the Federation representing Canada’s premiers, will also meet with fellow provincial and territorial leaders who will be in Washington on Wednesday to advocate for their respective jurisdictions. The trip to the U.S. underscores Mr. Ford’s pitch to the public in advance of the Feb. 27 vote, as the only leader who can stand up to Mr. Trump’s tariff threats. The opposition parties, however, have accused him of concocting a scheme to go to the polls a year-and-a-half early instead of doing his job as premier during a time of turmoil. Mr. Ford is set to speak to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Tuesday and later attend a reception hosted by Republican North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, one of U.S. President Donald Trump’s allies. Mr. Ford’s opposition critics have charged he’s unfairly using his Washington trip to campaign. The Ontario PC Party is paying for Mr. Ford’s expenses, as well as all political staff accompanying him, campaign spokeswoman Grace Lee said. Mr. Ford on Monday said his schedule is ""jam-packed"" with meetings, including with senators and members of Congress, and will focus on relationship-building and communication. ""We all know the U.S. knows that Canada needs the U.S., but what we’re going to communicate is everything the U.S. needs off of Canada, everything the U.S. needs off of Ontario,"" Mr. Ford said Monday at a campaign stop in Oakville, Ont. During his D.C. visit, Mr. Ford is set to promote his idea of a ""Fortress Am-Can"" to an American audience, pitching the strategic alliance between Canada and the U.S., including an integrated energy and electricity grid. On Monday, Mr. Ford announced that a re-elected PC government would ban the use of Chinese parts from all future energy procurement, as well as bar Chinese state-owned enterprises from buying or taking equity in any Ontario government-funded energy and critical mineral projects, or any major infrastructure assets. He said China is the biggest threat to North America’s economic success. ""China is playing by its own rules. It’s flooding markets, hijacking supply chains, undercutting our workers and threatening our industries. I’ll tell you right now, Ontario isn’t going to sit back and let it happen,"" Mr. Ford said. Mr. Trump has said he will announce plans Monday for 25-per-cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including from Canada. Mr. Ford said the U.S. President remains unpredictable. ""We’re going to face this for four years. Shifting goalposts constantly, and constant chaos, all designed to hurt our economy and undermine our workers,"" Mr. Ford said. He said Ontario is in ""constant communication"" with the federal government along with his fellow premiers, and he has also spoken to the CEOs of steel companies Stelco Inc. and ArcelorMittal Dofasco. He added he’s going to wait and see what Mr. Trump proposes before reacting. ""If it’s damaging, we’re going to react hard and we’re going to react fast,"" he said. ""If it comes our way – which [is] a fight we never started, a fight that we don’t want – but when someone you know gives you a pop in the nose, they’re going to get that pop twice as hard back,"" he added. He said Mr. Trump’s comments about annexing Canada are a ""real thing."" ""This threat is real, and this threat will be real for the next four years."" He also urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to immediately name a fentanyl czar, a position Mr. Trudeau said would soon be created after Mr. Trump last week delayed his previous threat of tariffs by 30 days. ""Name them now,"" Mr. Ford said.

"Poilievre pledges Arctic military base, naval icebreakers if party f orms government:   Conservative Leader cites need to counter growing threats from Russia and China, as well as desire to maintain good relations with United States",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is pledging, if his party forms government, to build a military base in Canada’s Arctic, buy two polar icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy and double the size of the Canadian Rangers patrol group responsible for upper reaches of the North. Mr. Poilievre is scheduled to unveil this pledge Monday morning in the Arctic city of Iqaluit. In a Conservative press statement obtained by The Globe and Mail, Mr. Poilievre cites the need to counter ""growing threats from China and Russia"" for these measures – as well as maintaining good relations with the United States. ""Our safety, territory and trade with the U.S. requires we take back control of Canada’s North,"" Mr. Poilievre said, adding that Beijing is trying to gain a foothold in the Arctic despite no territory fronting the region. ""Hostile powers want our resources and shipping routes, and to be within striking distance of our continent. China has now declared itself a ‘near-Arctic state,’ even though its borders are approximately 1,500 kilometres from the Arctic Circle,"" the Conservative statement says. Canada currently does not have a military base in the Arctic – the definition of what constitutes a base is variable – but the Forces do have a number of stations or installations across the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Canada’s defence spending. In January, before taking office, he said Canada, which this fiscal year is spending more than $40-billion on its military, should pay the United States for defending it ""They have a very small military. They rely on our military. It’s all fine, but they’ve got to pay for that,"" he said at a Jan. 7 press conference. Mr. Poilievre is pledging to fund his promises by making significant cuts to foreign aid – a means of finding more dollars for defence that he first mentioned in 2024. A Conservative government, the press statement says, would ""dramatically cut foreign aid, much of which goes to dictators, terrorists and global bureaucracies."" Examples his office provided last year would include assistance to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and Canada’s stake in the controversial Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Conservatives say the military base they envision in Iqaluit would be able to host a full Royal Canadian Air Force wing, or unit of command, to launch and land new F-35 fighter jets to deter, intercept and destroy threats as well as to land Poseidon P-8 surveillance aircraft that carry out search and rescue, conduct anti-submarine warfare, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance work. Iqaluit is already home to a Forward Operating Location for North American Aerospace Defence Command: an as-needed deployment facility including an aircraft hangar. The city also has a civilian airport and seaport. The two Navy icebreakers the Conservatives are promising would be on top of the two polar icebreakers the Seaspan and Davie shipyards are now building for the Canadian Coast Guard. Mr. Poilievre is pledging these existing icebreakers will be delivered by 2029. It’s not clear by what year the Conservative’s two promised naval icebreakers will be ready or what ice-breaking capacity they would have. The Canadian Rangers are lightly armed reservists in remote, isolated and coastal regions of Canada. They keep a lookout for unusual activity, assist in search and rescue, provide guide services to other Canadian Armed Forces members and help with disaster relief and community support. There are five patrol groups together numbering approximately 5,000 across the regions. Mr. Poilievre is pledging to double the size of the 1st Patrol Group of the Canadian Rangers, expanding it from 2,000 to 4,000 Rangers. This group is spread across the northernmost parts of Canada including Nunavut, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Atlin, B.C. In 2022, Canada’s then-top soldier General Wayne Eyre warned that Canada’s ""tenuous hold"" on its Arctic territories will come under increasing challenge in the decades ahead as China and Russia expand their presence in the region. Russia has been reopening Arctic military bases and outposts for years. China is also securing a significant presence in the Arctic as Russia, facing a severe budget crunch from its military assault on Ukraine, increasingly relies on Beijing and unprecedented levels of Chinese corporate and state investment to develop the northern region. Among Canada’s current installations across the region is Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island. It is a listening post that collects signals intelligence and has more than 50 full-time military and civilian personnel. It can also help with search and rescue and supports climate-change research. Ottawa is also upgrading infrastructure at four forward operating locations in the North: Inuvik, NWT, Yellowknife, Iqaluit and Goose Bay, N.L., including runway modifications, hangars, operations facilities, accommodations and telecommunication facilities. They are intended to support rapid deployment in the region. There is a naval refuelling facility under development at Nanisivik on Baffin Island, Nunavut, and Joint Task Force North has a headquarters in Yellowknife responsible for all Canadian Armed Forces operations and administration in northern Canada. Yellowknife is not however in the High Arctic like Iqaluit. Canada’s military presence in the North is to a significant extent comprised of annual training and exercise operations, which require the Forces to move assets and troops from southern Canada for the duration.

"POLITICAL O PERATIVE HELPED MULRONEY BECOME PRIME MINISTER:   While serving in the Senate, he was charged with influence peddling and faced a series of related court battles, resulting in an absolute discharge",2025.0,"Michel Cogger helped make Brian Mulroney prime minister. Mr. Mulroney rewarded his friend with an appointment to the Senate. Both contributed to the life of Canada. Both became embroiled in scandals. In Mr. Cogger’s case it led to charges of influence peddling which, after two trials, resulted in his being found guilty, although he was granted an absolute discharge. He paid tens of thousands of dollars in fines for his long absences from the Senate. These aspects of his life are part of his public legacy. But his more lasting legacy will be his behind-the-scenes role in bringing one of Canada’s most consequential prime ministers to office. Michel Benoit Cogger died on Jan. 27, at the age of 85 after a variety of age-related illnesses. He was predeceased by his wife, Erica, and leaves his children, Christine, Alexandre and Nicholas, and five grandchildren. Born in Quebec City on March 31, 1939, Mr. Cogger embraced sports and travel in his youth, which included spending time on a kibbutz in Israel. He arrived at Laval University law school in 1960, where he excelled, and where he became fast friends with another student, a working-class young man from Baie-Comeau named Brian Mulroney. Inspired by the prime ministership of John Diefenbaker, Mr. Mulroney was already an ardent Progressive Conservative, making him something of a political rarity in Quebec. The cohort of students at Laval in those years was among its most distinguished. Other classmates and friends included future Quebec premier and sovereigntist leader Lucien Bouchard, the future newspaper magnate Peter White, and future senator Michael Meighen, grandson of prime minister Arthur Meighen. While at Laval, Mr. Cogger and Mr. Mulroney helped Mr. White organize a symposium called the Congress on Canadian Affairs, which debated the topic: The Canadian Experiment: Success or Failure? The conference, which included speeches from Quebec premier Jean Lesage and federal justice minister Davie Fulton, attracted national attention. These were heady days. Mr. Lesage’s Liberal government presided over the first expression of the Quiet Revolution, as Quebec emerged from the oppressive and repressive rule of the Union Nationale and sought greater autonomy and self-expression – even, possibly, independence. Both Mr. Mulroney and Mr. Cogger went on to practise law, and they remained close friends. The pair were travelling through Europe in 1972 when Mr. Mulroney, by now a rising labour lawyer, was called back to Montreal to help settle a strike. Mr. Cogger was an usher at Mr. Mulroney’s wedding in May, 1973. One summer’s day in 1975, the Mulroneys visited Mr. Cogger and his wife, Erica, at their home in the Eastern Townships. Federal Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield had decided to step down, and during a long walk that day, Mr. Cogger talked to Mr. Mulroney about the coming leadership race. “He said the new leader must be young, attractive and forwardlooking,” Mr. Mulroney recalled in his memoirs. “He had to be fluently bilingual and must instinctively understand Quebec.” Mr. Cogger urged Mr. Mulroney to run for the leadership. Christine Cogger said her father told the family that the decision to put Mr. Mulroney forward as a leadership candidate was made collectively by his former Laval classmates. “They nominated him because of his oratorical skills and his good looks,” she said in an interview. Bill Fox was then a Quebec correspondent for Southam News. Years later he served as Mr. Mulroney’s press secretary. He remembers Mr. Cogger as someone who was both generous and insightful. He was “flawlessly bilingual, flawlessly bicultural,” Mr. Fox said, with “a pan-Canadian view of issues.” Mr. Cogger served as chairman of the 1976 leadership campaign, which brought Mr. Mulroney to national prominence. But it was Alberta MP Joe Clark who won the leadership and then the Canadian federal election of 1979, unseating Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Mr. Mulroney never fully accepted his loss to Mr. Clark, and after the Progressive Conservatives were defeated on their first budget in the House of Commons, and Mr. Trudeau returned to power in the February, 1980, election, many believe that Mr. Mulroney conspired to undermine Mr. Clark’s leadership, assisted by Mr. Cogger. Mr. Mulroney defeated Mr. Clark in the leadership convention of 1983, and Liberal Leader John Turner in the following year’s general election. In both that election and the election of 1988, Mr. Cogger raised funds and campaigned for Mr. Mulroney in Quebec. A grateful prime minister appointed his friend to the Senate in 1986. Before entering the Senate, Mr. Cogger had acted as a lawyer for companies owned by Quebec businessman Guy Montpetit, who was seeking government assistance and contracts. Mr. Cogger arranged meetings between Mr. Montpetit and federal politicians and officials who could provide such funds. Upon entering the Senate, Mr. Cogger continued that work, which he should not have done. One example: Mr. Cogger referred to a proposal for a computer translation service operated by Mr. Montpetit during lunch in 1988 with the senator’s old Laval University friend, Mr. Bouchard, now secretary of state. But there was no arm-twisting involved, Mr. Bouchard later testified at trial, and officials eventually rejected the proposal. In 1991, the RCMP charged the senator with influence peddling. As a Supreme Court of Canada judgment later observed: “The accused was very effective in having ministers and senior officials meet in order to ‘advance’ his client’s business.” But “while he appeared to be very good at having these people meet very quickly, the meetings never had the expected success, as no grants were awarded to Guy Montpetit’s companies.” Mr. Cogger’s troubles were hardly unique. In the first two years of Mr. Mulroney’s first government, five ministers resigned because of scandals, with others departing in later years. Most famously, Mr. Mulroney himself acknowledged that he had received substantial sums from Karlheinz Schreiber, a shady business operator, for reasons never properly explained. At Mr. Cogger’s first trial, a Quebec judge acquitted him, reasoning the lawyer might not have realized his actions were illegal. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld this verdict, but in 1997, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial on the grounds that ignorance of the law is not a defence. At the 1998 retrial, Mr. Cogger was found guilty and sentenced to do probation, community service and pay fines. He appealed the sentence in 2001 and was granted an absolute discharge. “It has been a long, agonizing descent,” for the senator, Maclean’s magazine said at the time. “Driving his late-model MercedesBenz coupe, heli-skiing in Austria and entertaining lavishly in his three homes, Cogger embodied the heady early Mulroney years. Now 59, his influence and homes are gone, and he drives a beat-up 10-year-old compact car.” Christine Cogger remembers her parents having to sell the family home, and the family being beset by reporters and RCMP officers. “It was a really difficult time for our family.” In 2001, the Quebec Court of Appeal gave Mr. Cogger an absolute discharge, which meant he had no criminal record. The year before, Mr. Cogger had resigned from the Senate, after being fined $23,250 for missing sessions. He was absent from the upper house much of the time during his legal troubles. In the years that followed, Mr. Cogger lived quietly, tending to his wife who had fallen ill with cancer. Erica Cogger died in 2012. In his final years, Mr. Cogger dealt with a number of age-related illnesses. He continued to follow politics closely, lamenting its growing polarization. In his day, people from different parties could battle in the House or Senate, then go out for a beer together after. No more. Christine Cogger remembers her father as a “master storyteller” who was “part of a group of individuals who cared deeply about Canada and making it a better place.” Whatever his legal troubles, he devoted much of his life to his party and his country, both of which he loved.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Ibbitson, John",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 10, 2025",Leadership; Bilingualism; Prime ministers,Nom: Laval University; NAICS: 611310,2025-02-10,The Globe and Mail

"Political operative Michel Cogger helped Brian Mulroney become prime minister:   While serving in the Senate, Cogger was charged with influence peddling and faced a series of related court battles, resulting in an absolute discharge",2025.0,"Michel Cogger helped make Brian Mulroney prime minister. Mr. Mulroney rewarded his friend with an appointment to the Senate. Both contributed to the life of Canada. Both became embroiled in scandals. In Mr. Cogger’s case it led to charges of influence peddling which, after two trials, resulted in his being found guilty, although he was granted an absolute discharge. He paid tens of thousands of dollars in fines for his long absences from the Senate. These aspects of his life are part of his public legacy. But his more lasting legacy will be his behind-the-scenes role in bringing one of Canada’s most consequential prime ministers to office. Michel Benoit Cogger died on Jan. 27, at the age of 85 after a variety of age-related illnesses. He was predeceased by his wife, Erica, and leaves his children, Christine, Alexandre and Nicholas, and five grandchildren. Born in Quebec City on March 31, 1939, Mr. Cogger embraced sports and travel in his youth, which included spending time on a kibbutz in Israel. He arrived at Laval University law school in 1960, where he excelled, and where he became fast friends with another student, a working-class young man from Baie-Comeau named Brian Mulroney. Inspired by the prime ministership of John Diefenbaker, Mr. Mulroney was already an ardent Progressive Conservative, making him something of a political rarity in Quebec. The cohort of students at Laval in those years was among its most distinguished. Other classmates and friends included future Quebec premier and sovereigntist leader Lucien Bouchard, the future newspaper magnate Peter White, and future senator Michael Meighen, grandson of prime minister Arthur Meighen. While at Laval, Mr. Cogger and Mr. Mulroney helped Mr. White organize a symposium called the Congress on Canadian Affairs, which debated the topic: The Canadian Experiment: Success or Failure? The conference, which included speeches from Quebec Premier Jean Lesage and federal Justice Minister Davie Fulton, attracted national attention. These were heady days. Mr. Lesage’s Liberal government presided over the first expression of the Quiet Revolution, as Quebec emerged from the oppressive and repressive rule of the Union Nationale and sought greater autonomy and self-expression – even, possibly, independence. Both Mr. Mulroney and Mr. Cogger went on to practise law, and they remained close friends. The pair were travelling through Europe in 1972 when Mr. Mulroney, by now a rising labour lawyer, was called back to Montreal to help settle a strike. Mr. Cogger was an usher at Mr. Mulroney’s wedding in May, 1973. One summer’s day in 1975, the Mulroneys visited Mr. Cogger and his wife, Erica, at their home in the Eastern Townships. Federal Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield had decided to step down, and during a long walk that day, Mr. Cogger talked to Mr. Mulroney about the coming leadership race. ""He said the new leader must be young, attractive and forward-looking,"" Mr. Mulroney recalled in his memoirs. ""He had to be fluently bilingual and must instinctively understand Quebec."" Mr. Cogger urged Mr. Mulroney to run for the leadership. Christine Cogger said her father told the family that the decision to put Mr. Mulroney forward as a leadership candidate was made collectively by his former Laval classmates. ""They nominated him because of his oratorical skills and his good looks,"" she said in an interview. Bill Fox was then a Quebec correspondent for Southam News. Years later he served as Mr. Mulroney’s press secretary. He remembers Mr. Cogger as someone who was both generous and insightful. He was ""flawlessly bilingual, flawlessly bicultural,"" Mr. Fox said, with ""a pan-Canadian view of issues."" Mr. Cogger served as chairman of the 1976 leadership campaign, which brought Mr. Mulroney to national prominence. But it was Alberta MP Joe Clark who won the leadership and then the Canadian federal election of 1979, unseating Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Mr. Mulroney never fully accepted his loss to Mr. Clark, and after the Progressive Conservatives were defeated on their first budget in the House of Commons, and Mr. Trudeau returned to power in the February, 1980 election, many believe that Mr. Mulroney conspired to undermine Mr. Clark’s leadership, assisted by Mr. Cogger. Mr. Mulroney defeated Mr. Clark in the leadership convention of 1983, and Liberal Leader John Turner in the following year’s general election. In both that election and the election of 1988, Mr. Cogger raised funds and campaigned for Mr. Mulroney in Quebec. A grateful prime minister appointed his friend to the Senate in 1986. Before entering the Senate, Mr. Cogger had acted as a lawyer for companies owned by Quebec businessman Guy Montpetit, who was seeking government assistance and contracts. Mr. Cogger arranged meetings between Mr. Montpetit and federal politicians and officials who could provide such funds. Upon entering the Senate, Mr. Cogger continued that work, which he should not have done. One example: Mr. Cogger referred to a proposal for a computer translation service operated by Mr. Montpetit during lunch in 1988 with the senator’s old Laval University friend, Mr. Bouchard, now secretary of state. But there was no arm-twisting involved, Mr. Bouchard later testified at trial, and officials eventually rejected the proposal. In 1991, the RCMP charged the senator with influence peddling. As a Supreme Court of Canada judgment later observed: ""The accused was very effective in having ministers and senior officials meet in order to ‘advance’ his client’s business."" But ""while he appeared to be very good at having these people meet very quickly, the meetings never had the expected success, as no grants were awarded to Guy Montpetit’s companies."" Mr. Cogger’s troubles were hardly unique. In the first two years of Mr. Mulroney’s first government, five ministers resigned because of scandals, with others departing in later years. Most famously, Mr. Mulroney himself acknowledged that he had received substantial sums from Karlheinz Schreiber, a shady business operator, for reasons never properly explained. At Mr. Cogger’s first trial, a Quebec judge acquitted him, reasoning the lawyer might not have realized his actions were illegal. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld this verdict but in 1997 the Supreme Court ordered a new trial on the grounds that ignorance of the law is not a defence. At the 1998 retrial, Mr. Cogger was found guilty and sentenced to do probation, community service and pay fines. He appealed the sentence in 2001 and was granted an absolute discharge. ""It has been a long, agonizing descent,"" for the senator, Maclean’s magazine said at the time. ""Driving his late-model Mercedes-Benz coupe, heli-skiing in Austria and entertaining lavishly in his three homes, Cogger embodied the heady early Mulroney years. Now 59, his influence and homes are gone, and he drives a beat-up 10-year-old compact car."" Christine Cogger remembers her parents having to sell the family home, and the family being beset by reporters and RCMP officers. ""It was a really difficult time for our family."" In 2001, the Quebec Court of Appeal gave Mr. Cogger an absolute discharge, which meant he had no criminal record. The year before, Mr. Cogger had resigned from the Senate, after being fined $23,250 for missing sessions. He was absent from the upper house much of the time during his legal troubles. In the years that followed, Mr. Cogger lived quietly, tending to his wife who had fallen ill with cancer. Erica Cogger died in 2012. In his final years, Mr. Cogger dealt with a number of age-related illnesses. He continued to follow politics closely, lamenting its growing polarization. In his day, people from different parties could battle in the House or Senate, then go out for a beer together after. No more. Christine Cogger remembers her father as a ""master storyteller"" who was ""part of a group of individuals who cared deeply about Canada and making it a better place."" Whatever his legal troubles, he devoted much of his life to his party and his country, both of which he loved. You can find more obituaries from The Globe and Mail here .

"Poilievre was riding a Trump-like wave. Is it about to drown him?:   In a recurring feature, Susan Delacourt, a small-l liberal, and Matt Gurney, a small-c conservative, bring their different perspectives - and shared commitment to civil disagreement - to the political debates of the moment",2025.0,"SD Donald Trump is no friend to progressives in Canada, to state the obvious. But I'm sure I'm not the only person wondering these days how much of a pal he is to Canadian conservatives, both provincially and federally. Trump's 30-day reprieve of tariffs on Canadian imports kind of pulled the rug out from Doug Ford's whole provincial election pitch to Ontarians, who will now vote on Feb. 27 without any clue on what Trump will do next. Meanwhile, polls are showing that Pierre Poilievre and the federal Conservatives are taking a hit in popularity as Canadians shift their attention to who's best to deal with the havoc Trump is wreaking. So my question to you, Matt: is it time for Poilievre's team to get nervous? MG No, except to the background extent of how nervous the rest of us are and should be about the total crap show that is the world today. It's clear that Ford's plan was upended a bit by the tariff delay and polling also shows that Ontarians are convinced that Ford called the election for selfish reasons - but the polls also show Ford is cruising to a big majority anyway. Likewise, polls have suggested (admittedly, with some pretty spectacular divergence) that the federal race has tightened, but most still show a commanding Conservative lead. The race has tightened from a historic Conservative blowout to merely an unusually large Conservative win. The Conservatives themselves are adjusting their strategy - belatedly, I think, but all the same - and they haven't really begun to campaign against Mark Carney yet, who's mostly keeping a low profile. I definitely think the time may come for them to get nervous, but I don't think that time is now, and I don't think they are yet. After all, dropping Justin Trudeau for Carney isn't exactly something they haven't had some time to muse about and prepare for. SD I disagree (which is good, because that's what we're supposed to be doing here). To me, the Conservatives look entirely unprepared for Carney. Changing their slogans to the ""Carney-Trudeau Liberals"" looks like a communications strategy built from Popsicle sticks and Elmer's glue. MG You're not the target audience. SD I'll grant you that. But Poilievre needs Liberals who have drifted. I'm wary, as you know, of casting this Liberal leadership race as a coronation for Carney; I think all of the candidates deserve a fair hearing. But one of the things that Liberals have lacked over the past few years is what the pros like to call a ""narrative"" - a story to tell about why Canada needs a middle-ground party. Trump's bullying is giving them a story again. MG There's always been a story. What the Liberals lacked was the means to tell it, since their ability to communicate had collapsed into a void of incompetence, as had their ability to execute on their policy agenda - and, weirdly, their ability to perceive electoral facts and react accordingly, especially as pertains to an outgoing prime minister's job performance. I don't see any evidence here of anything beyond the Liberals hitting rock bottom and bouncing up a bit now that they're (almost) free of the prime minister, who should have either jumped or been shoved into retirement 18 months ago. There's been no campaign yet, no defining issues (although we can clearly take a good guess at what one will likely be). Conservatives should be wary and alert, and I think they are. But nervous? No. Maybe later. But not yet. SD So we'll put you down as a ""maybe"" on the Liberals' return from the dead? MG Ha. Well, that would be accurate. There's definitely a scenario in which the Conservative party snatches defeat from the jaws of victory, and every single prediction I'd make these days comes with a Donald Trump-sized asterisk. So yes, put me down as a maybe on that. But more relevant to the point, put me down as skeptical that the Conservatives are nervous, because something you said here is worth zooming in on. You said Poilievre needs Liberals who've drifted. He might. He'd certainly need them to win some seats. But I think the lesson for us all in recent years is that elections can be won by motivating new voters. Poilievre has been doing that. Some Toronto Liberals getting Carney fever may not do much to offset that. SD I will say this: this upsurge in Canadian patriotism is a wild card. Conservatives have been very good in the past about wrapping themselves in the flag - and I'm not talking about the F--k Trudeau one. I can see ways in which Poilievre can capitalize on that, although he'll need to be a bit more careful about his ""Canada is broken"" line if he doesn't want to be seen as agreeing with Trump. I already see signs that he's toning that down a bit. MG I do, too. The smart play for him will be to keep hammering on that, but with a more optimistic and urgent message: ""It's time to fix what's broken and make Canada stronger."" Something like that. I think there is an appetite out there for some real change, and that's why Carney is trying to present himself as an outsider. I have doubts it'll work. SD The fact that Trump and Carney are forcing the Conservatives to pivot reinforces to me that it is time for them to be nervous - or at least go back to the drawing board on all the slogans that worked so well over the last couple of years. MG I hope we get a real campaign, with real debates over real issues. I think we'll get different slogans and Carney ducking the media as much as possible while the Conservatives keep the Twitter war machine running all the time. In other words, we'll get the same strategy with slightly new tactics. It's not what the country needs, but I think it's what's coming.

"PC's lead in Nepean, according to early election poll",2025.0,"Nepean Progressive Conservative candidate Alex Lewis is the front-runner in the riding for the Feb. 27 provincial election, according to a poll conducted by Mainstreet Research on Feb. 5. The poll of 507 adults in the Nepean district, a seat that had been held by outgoing Ontario cabinet minister Lisa MacLeod since 2006, showed that Lewis had support of 33.5 per cent of respondents. Liberal candidate Tyler Watt was favoured by 27.5 per cent, followed by Max Blair of the NDP (6.9 per cent) and Shelagh McLeran of the Green Party (1.7 per cent). The undecided count was 26.5 per cent. The Mainstreet poll was conducted via both landlines and cellphones, across all age groups and economic backgrounds and carries a plus/minus error of 4.4 per cent. The poll is roughly in line with party leanings across Ontario, according to a Mainstreet survey of more than 1,200 respondents across the province, conducted between Feb. 3 and Feb. 5. That survey showed 32 per cent would support PC Leader Doug Ford and 23.5 per cent favouring Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie. The NDP, headed Marit Stiles, was favoured by 15 per cent of poll respondents. The undecided count was 22 per cent. The Nepean riding includes the ever-expanding Barrhaven and Bells Corners districts and boasts a population of 132,000, according to the 2021 census. The breakdown of the poll in Nepean showed more commitment from voters 65 and above. Lewis was supported by 44.5 per cent of that group, followed by Watt at 38.1 per cent and Blair at 4.7 per cent, but only 9.4 per cent of seniors were undecided. That contrasts with the 18-49 demographic, where almost 39 per cent of poll respondents reported being undecided. In that class, Lewis was favoured by 25.9 per cent, Watt by 17.7 per cent and Blair by 10.3 per cent. MacLeod was first elected in 2006 in what was then the riding of Nepean-Carleton, replacing John Baird after he jumped to federal politics. She won re-election five more times, including three times in Nepean-Carleton and twice in the redrawn riding of Nepean. kwarren@postmedia.com Our website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark our homepage and sign up for our newslettersso we can keep you informed.

Amy Hamm: The therapeutic effect of Pierre Poilievre,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre has become a lightning rod for Canadians' frustration, and for those seeking cathartic release from simply being a Canadian - whatever that means, what with our ongoing national identity crisis - in 2025. Outside of the Vancouver Wall Centre on the night of Feb. 4, a small crowd of pro-Palestine protesters, including one with a ""Queers for Palestine"" flag draped on their back, huddled and shouted in the snowy, -6C air. Poilievre was there to speak to a crowd of Conservative party donors inside. Clusters of Vancouver police officers in high-visibility vests kept the disruption outdoors. One protester's sign suggested he was angry at the $1,750 price of admission to the ballroom event, drawing some imponderable connection between conflict in Gaza - now in a tenuous ceasefire - and a Canadian politician raising funds during the pre-election season. As politicians of every stripe do. (My ticket was complimentary, for the record.) Earlier in the day, a different group of protesters chanted about white supremacy and fascism, jeering ""Hey hey, ho ho, Poilievre has got go!"" and ""Hey hey, ho ho, fascism has got to go!"" as he visited Vancouver's Temple Shalom Synagogue. One banner read, ""Jews say no to the politics of bigotry and hate."" Whose politics? Poilievre's? To be fair, we now know that those involved in the pro-Palestinian movement will accuse anyone of genocide. These people are mad at everyone with a scintilla of power. Carry on. Back at the Wall Centre, and despite the lively nature of an evening of cocktails, fundraising and politics shared amongst party supporters, the theme of the night was - undeniably - our national malcontent. Poilievre gave an address on his vision for Canada similar to those we have heard in his pressers, podcast appearances and impassioned speeches on the floor of Parliament. His tone was more intimate and casual, however, as though he was surrounded by friends. He said he wanted an election ""yesterday."" Ask Jagmeet Singh when it will be, he told the crowd. ""Maybe donate all the money from the fundraiser to his pension so that he can call the election earlier."" He also used the night to share a policy announcement he would give the public the next day: life in prison for fentanyl kingpins It sounded like the political promise of a Central American leader during Richard Nixon's War on Drugs. But no, half a century on, it's just a pledge that resonates with Canadians weary from hearing about opioid overdose deaths and fed up with the public health officials pushing ""harm reduction"" policies. The night's question-and-answer period felt as though it was part therapy session. One man, Jas Arora of Abbotsford, nervously blurted out some of the details of his saga as a business owner and victim of an extortion gang that the RCMP created a task force to investigate nearly one year ago. ""My mom passed away and I asked the police to attend (the funeral hall) because they were threatening to kill my kids,"" he stammered. I spoke to Arora earlier in the night, and he told me his adult children left Canada because they do not feel safe here. He didn't have a question for Poilievre so much as a requiem for the country he thought Canada could have been - and should have been - for his children. Another man, pointing to his cane, told the crowd he sat on a waitlist for nearly two years before receiving necessary medical care. After Poilievre gave his canned answer on fixing health care, he shared a joke: ""They say that if you have a heart attack, don't call 911, call a taxi - 'cause the driver's probably a doctor."" If you don't laugh, you'll cry. Others had similar questions. What about tuition costs? Bureaucrats strangling small businesses with red tape? Our devalued currency? All anxieties and frustrations, and even disbelief, about the country we are all standing in. The night was a release of energy with nowhere else to go. Where is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau? He's hiding and on his way out. Those ""F**k Trudeau"" flags just don't provide the same dopamine hit they used to. Jagmeet? Irrelevant And then there is the Chrystia Freeland or Mark Carney sideshow of shameful vanity and capriciousness. Neither make good targets for a purge of our pent-up Canad-anger. (Canad-anger: it's like the ""hangry,"" portmanteau of hungry and angry, but instead it means we are mad at the dismal state of our country.) Are these two really in the midst of their own personal marketing campaigns while the country hovers on the brink of a trade war with our ""best friend"" and the largest economy in the world - selling themselves to a populace that largely doesn't want them? And then there's Poilievre. Whether you love or hate him, need to yell and scream and shout at him, or sing his praises once you've calmed down - he's our guy, apparently.

PC leader promises to tunnel under 401:   His opponents prefer to focus on adding doctors,2025.0,"Some have warned it's a money pit, but Doug Ford is plowing ahead with a tunnel under Highway 401 from Mississauga to Scarborough despite not knowing the cost. The Progressive Conservative leader seeking a third term as premier made the promise Friday as the NDP's Marit Stiles and Liberal chief Bonnie Crombie touted their plans to get everyone in Ontario a family doctor. ""It will be the biggest tunnel in the entire world,"" Ford boasted of his plan unveiled last fall to skepticism from opposition parties over concerns it would cost tens of billions of dollars and take many years. Ford acknowledged at a Scarborough auto parts plant that a feasibility study is not yet complete, nor is a cost estimate, for what he conceded would be an ""ambitious"" effort to dig an ""express"" tunnel with traffic and transit lanes. ""It won't happen overnight,"" he cautioned. ""That Doug Ford would throw out this idea with no cost estimate and no timeline is just insulting to the people of Ontario,"" said Green Leader Mike Schreiner. Stiles, who was in Sault Ste. Marie detailing a $4-billion plan to lure 3,500 more doctors to Ontario, said the faster way to ease gridlock on the 401 is to negotiate with the private owners of the less busy Highway 407 to scrap charges for motorists. ""Ford would rather spend $100 billion on a Fantasy Tunnel than just remove the damn tolls on the 407. I'll get them removed, permanently,"" she wrote on social media. Crombie also took a shot from Thunder Bay. ""While Doug Ford wastes your money on a tunnel that will never actually get built, Ontario's Liberals will get you a family doctor,"" she wrote on X. Ford said forecasts show the 400-series highways in the Toronto area will be at capacity in the next 10 years, so ""we owe it to the drivers"" to proceed with a tunnel. He pledged this week to remove tolls from the provincially owned portion of the 407, from Brock Road in Pickering east to Highway 115/35. Tolls would remain on the rest of the highway. With the Ontario Medical Association saying 2.5 million Ontarians don't have a family doctor, opposition parties are trying to make health care an issue in the Feb. 27 campaign. The Conservatives have pledged to get two million Ontarians a family doctor within four years.

Trump slows Poilievre's race to power,2025.0,"For Conservative strategists, this wasn't supposed to happen. Just a few weeks ago, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre appeared to be on his way to winning a crushing majority government in the next election, and the conversation in Ottawa was about whether the Liberals would end up in third or fourth place. Last weekend, however, U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threat and musing about making Canada a 51st state changed the game. A Conservative victory is now less certain - and Poilievre, who spent the past two years telling Canadians the country was ""broken,"" is struggling to rebrand. On Friday, a Pallas poll suggested the Conservative lead in public support heading into the next election campaign is now just six percentage points - a stunning plunge from the 20-point lead pollsters registered a month ago, and the apparent confirmation of movement in Ontario and Quebec reported by competing pollsters. More worrisome perhaps for them is that Pallas has the Conservatives and Liberals neck and neck if Mark Carney becomes the Grits's next leader. The Pallas poll comes on the heels of a Leger survey that had support for the Liberals surging in Quebec, tied with the Bloc Québécois and ahead if Carney was their leader. Ironically, if Poilievre had not been so successful in his prosecution of Trudeau, blaming him for everything from crime in Toronto's subways to the rising cost of groceries, the prime minister's unpopularity might not have prompted Liberal MPs to push him towards the exit. If Poilievre had not been so successful in prosecuting the case against the consumer price on carbon - the ""carbon tax"" - the Liberal leadership contestants would not have pledged to scrap it immediately. Ditto for Poilievre's prosecution of the capital gains tax increase. Poilievre was left with neither the opponent he wanted nor the issue he hoped to run on. But those were January problems. With tweaks to Poilievre's talking points, the Tories would frame the next Liberal leader as a carbon copy of Trudeau and spend enough money to make sure the message got across. Then came Trump. The U.S. president's threat to slap a 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian imports was met with a response from Trudeau that even Conservatives admitted had hit the mark. Trudeau urged his fellow Canadians ""to remain united"" and ""to support one another."" He complemented the provinces - ""This is team Canada at its best"" - and pledged that the federal government would ""be there for Canadians."" That hope and optimism in the face of despair not only clashed with Poilievre's anger narrative, but also risked undermining the Conservatives' campaign promises and the party's internal coalition. After all, Poilievre had spent years pledging to cut government spending, balancing each dollar's worth of new spending with a dollar's worth of cuts. Was that now what Canadians would want? On Sunday, Poilievre attempted a pivot. When the tariff threat was still on the table, he appeared more statesmanlike, even agreeing with Trudeau on the need for retaliatory tariffs. But when the tariff threat was pushed back by 30 days, Poilievre pivoted again. ""Whether or not we agree with (Trump) should not matter,"" he told Canadians. The Liberals had caused the drug crisis, he said, and he would crack down on it - not to please Trump, but because it was the right thing to do. Part of Poilievre's challenge is that his coalition includes Ontario Conservatives, who want someone like Premier Doug Ford who'll fight Trump with everything the country can throw at him, and Alberta Conservatives. who support Premier Danielle Smith and her approach of validating Trump's concerns. Recall that, back in October, another Leger poll found more Conservative voters (45 per cent) wanted Trump to win the U.S. presidential election than wanted Kamala Harris (42 per cent) to win. Pallas CEO Joseph Angolano is not surprised by the uptick in Liberal support. He sees it as an emotional reaction to Trump's tariff threat. ""Public opinion tends to favour incumbents in times of crisis,"" he told the Star. Canadians certainly did respond emotionally, wrapping themselves with national pride and checking labels to ensure they were not buying American products. Even support for sovereignty in Quebec dropped to its lowest level in more than five years. ""Overnight, sovereignty dropped like eight points,"" noted polling aggregator Philippe J. Fournier of Canada338.com. ""That's a rally-around-the-flag effect, at least in Quebec - and if it happened in Quebec, it may happen elsewhere."" The Conservatives are hoping that any rallying happens around them. They've moved on to a new tag line, ""Canada First,"" and next week, as first reported in the Hill Times, they plan a big rally on National Flag of Canada Day to cement that message. But after trying to brand Canada Day with red, white and blue during prime minister Stephen Harper's time in office, you might say it's a sign of desperate times that the Tories are encouraging everyone to ditch the blue in favour of just red and white.

Poilievre says Charter allows locking up drug kingpins; Fentanyl Crisis,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he's not worried about the Charter of Rights and Freedoms getting in the way of his promise to lock away drug dealers if he becomes prime minister, including by imposing mandatory life sentences on ""fentanyl kingpins."" He says the Charter itself calls for tough criminal laws targeting fentanyl pushers ... if you look at it a certain way. ""What I am proposing today is not only allowed under the Charter, it is required by the Charter,"" said Poilievre, when asked if he was prepared to use Section 33 of the Charter, the notwithstanding clause, to insulate mandatory minimum prison sentences for fentanyl-related crimes from the courts. ""Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees life, liberty and security of the person,"" said Poilievre. ""Fifty-thousand people had their Section 7 right to life violated by the open borders, soft-on-crime, legaldrugs policy of the Liberals,"" he added, referring to the estimated number of Canadians who've succumbed to opioid-related deaths since 2016. Poilievre said that judges ""are going to be obliged"" to uphold the law he's promising, given its clear intent of preventing future spirals of addiction and drug-related deaths. The Opposition Leader was speaking at a policy announcement at the Port of Vancouver. Earlier in the day, Poilievre issued a press release promising mandatory life sentences for anyone convicted of trafficking, producing or exporting more than 40 milligrams of fentanyl, as well as mandatory 15-year sentences for traffickers caught with between 20 and 40 milligrams. The illegal distribution of fentanyl, a Schedule 1 drug, carries a maximum life sen-tence under existing criminal law. The Supreme Court of Canada recently upheld a provincial decision setting a nine-year sentence as a non-mandatory ""starting point"" for wholesale fentanyl trafficking. Two milligrams of fentanyl is generally considered to be a fatal dose for the average person, although long-term users may develop a tolerance for much larger quantities. Joanna Baron, executive director of the Canadian Constitution Foundation, says she doesn' t share Poilievre's confidence about the promised mandatory minimums passing constitutional muster. ""The bottom line is if he wants to do this, he'll need to invoke Section 33,"" said Baron. Baron said that the quantities of fentanyl tied to mandatory minimums would be hard to defend in court, opening the door to a challenge for cruel and unusual punishment. ""It's easy to imagine a scenario where an addict has 20 to 40 milligrams (of fentanyl) on their person, and is dealing (drugs) under some kind of duress,"" said Baron. A recent analysis by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency found that nearly half of illicit fentanyl tablets contain at least two milligrams of the substance, meaning it could take just 10 tablets to put someone over Poilievre's promised threshold for mandatory minimum sentences. Poilievre hasn't said definitively that he'll use Section 33 to push through a more tough-on-crime agenda, but has said he'll reverse the Liberals' Bill C-5. Bill C-5, passed in 2022, eliminated more than a dozen mandatory minimum penalties on the books, including all mandatory minimums for drug-related offences, bringing the Criminal Code in line with major Supreme Court decisions striking down such penalties.

"Canadians believe Mark Carney would be better than Pierre Poilievre in dealing with Trump, poll finds:   What Mr. Carney has going for him is that he wa s in charge of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis and headed the Bank of England when he warned of the economic consequences of pulling Britain out of the European Union, expert says",2025.0,"Canadians believe that former central banker Mark Carney would do a better job of handling Canadian trade and tariff negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump than Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre, according to a new public-opinion survey. The poll also found that a strong majority of Canadians favour immediate retaliation against Americans if they impose hefty tariffs, including suspension of energy exports and removal of U.S. beer, wine and liquor from store shelves. On Monday, Mr. Trump agreed to pause the implementation of planned 25-per-cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for at least 30 days. Canadian energy exports to the United States would have been hit with a 10-per-cent tariff. A poll conducted for The Globe and Mail and CTV News by Nanos Research between Jan. 31 and Feb. 3 found that 39.6 per cent of Canadians surveyed consider Mr. Carney, the front-runner for the Liberal leadership, as the most qualified leader to negotiate with Mr. Trump and his administration. Twenty-six per cent of Canadians consider Mr. Poilievre as best qualified. ""Not only do they think he is more qualified but he has a significant advantage over Pierre Poilievre,"" said Nik Nanos, chief data scientist at Nanos Research. ""This is significant because our next election will probably be a referendum on who is best able to manage the relationship with Donald Trump."" What Mr. Carney has going for him is that he was in charge of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis and headed the Bank of England when he warned of the economic consequences of pulling Britain out of the European Union, Mr. Nanos said. ""He dealt with the financial crisis under the Harper administration. He dealt with the Brexit crisis in the United Kingdom. I think for Canadians who are not experts, I think they see someone who is best likely to manage the U.S. and has experience."" Mr. Nanos said Mr. Poilievre will need to pivot quickly from his attacks on Mr. Carney over carbon pricing to the biggest economic threat facing the country. Mr. Carney announced last week that he would rescind carbon pricing if he becomes prime minister and would enact incentives to get Canadians to buy greener products. ""The situation with the United States and the potential of tariffs is a much higher magnitude of a threat to Canada in day-to-day reality than the carbon tax,"" Mr. Nanos said. The Nanos poll found that 12.5 per cent of those surveyed believe that Mr. Carney’s closest Liberal leadership rival, Chrystia Freeland, as best able to handle Mr. Trump. The ex-finance minister has struggled to gain traction in the leadership race, with the majority of her former cabinet colleagues and Liberal MPs backing Mr. Carney. ""Even though Freeland did negotiate the previous renewal of the free-trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico, she trails by a factor of three to one with Mark Carney,"" he said. ""Within the Liberal family, it is pretty clear that Carney would be viewed as doing a better job than Freeland and within an election, he is seen as being able to do a better job of negotiating with Donald Trump than Pierre Poilievre."" Former cabinet minister Karina Gould, who is also running for the Liberal leadership, barley registered, with only 0.6 per cent viewing her as best qualified to manage U.S. negotiations. Former Liberal MPs Frank Baylis and Ruby Dhalla are also running for the leadership but were not included in this survey. Nanos Research surveyed 1,077 Canadians through land line, cellphone and online interviews. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. The poll also found that 76 per cent of Canadians support or somewhat support suspending oil, natural gas and electricity exports to the U.S. and 88 per cent support or somewhat support the removal of U.S. alcohol from stores should Mr. Trump push ahead with tariffs. Close to three in five Canadians say that if the U.S. raises tariffs on Canadian products, Ottawa should retaliate immediately with dollar-for-dollar tariffs on U.S. imports, while 14 per cent say Canada should do everything possible to avoid escalating any U.S. action into a trade war. ""If you are an American looking at these numbers, you are going to be thinking that whomever the next prime minister is has the latitude to retaliate from Canada and [Canadians] are on board,"" Mr. Nanos said. Most Canadians (64 per cent) say Canada should increase defence spending either to the NATO target of two per cent of GDP or to increase it further to five per cent (12 per cent) of the GDP, as recently demanded by Mr. Trump. Only 14 per cent say Canada should maintain current defence spending at 1.37 per cent of GDP and six per cent would prefer to spend less than what Canada currently spends. ""Canadians are not hawks. They are not militaristic but they do understand that we have to catch up on defence spending with our allies,"" Mr. Nanos said.

Conservatives would jail major fentanyl dealers for life:   Poilievre says people have the right ‘to expect their children will not die in back alleys’,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says a government led by him would jail major fentanyl dealers for life and the legislation would be backed with an unusual Charter of Rights and Freedoms legal argument. Mr. Poilievre announced Wednesday his proposal to deter the domestic manufacture of fentanyl with a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison – 25 years without the chance of parole. Such a punishment is reserved for only a few crimes, including high treason and firstdegree murder. The deadly drug fentanyl is at the centre of a historic trade battle between Canada and the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian imports unless Canada cracks down on fentanyl at the border, among other measures. Fentanyl trafficking, under existing law, can already be punished with life in prison, and sentences are often more than 10 years. The Conservative law would impose the mandatory sentence of 25 years without parole on people who make and sell 40 milligrams of the potent opioid fentanyl. It is an amount Mr. Poilievre said could kill 20 people, describing it as mass murder. “This penalty that I propose is proportionate to the crime,” he told reporters in response to a question about the Charter. “If you kill dozens of people, you should go away for life.” He suggested his proposed law would invoke Section 7 of the Charter, which protects the right to life, liberty and security of the person. He said judges would “be obliged” to respect Section 7 given the many Canadians who are harmed or killed by fentanyl. “What I am proposing is necessary to uphold the Charter,” Mr. Poilievre said. “Here’s how I interpret the Charter: that lawabiding people have the right to expect their children will not die in back alleys.” Mr. Poilievre’s plan to impose a mandatory minimum sentence puts him in disputed legal territory – but his legislative approach appears different from what Stephen Harper employed when he was Conservative prime minister from 2006 to 2015. Mr. Harper tripled the number of crimes subject to a minimum sentence, to 72. The laws were strict, with no judicial discretion. This made them vulnerable to Charter challenges. The Supreme Court of Canada does not oppose stiff sentences for serious crimes but struck down several of Mr. Harper’s minimums for being overly broad. That included for possession of a loaded prohibited firearm in 2015. The top court’s rationale was rooted in a violation of Section 12 of the Charter, the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The top court, however, has also upheld mandatory minimums, such as in 2023 for armed robbery. Mr. Poilievre has said he would be the first prime minister, if elected, to use Section 33 of the Charter, the notwithstanding clause. He would focus on criminal sentencing issues. Section 33 can override the section on cruel and unusual punishment. On Wednesday, when asked whether he would use the notwithstanding clause to defend his proposed law against fentanyl dealers, Mr. Poilievre didn’t address its possible use. Legal experts on Wednesday had a range of views on Mr. Poilievre’s strategy. The proposed law, if enacted and challenged in court, would require the federal Justice Department to come up with a new approach to Section 7, compared to previous governments. Geoffrey Sigalet, director of the University of British Columbia Research Group for Constitutional Law, said Mr. Poilievre “may be willing to dare to the courts to invalidate the law” with his invocation of Section 7 and security of the person. “It will depend on how the law is crafted,” Prof. Sigalet said. Cheryl Webster, a criminology professor at the University of Ottawa who focuses on sentencing and deterrence, said overly tough punishments are not effective. “There is virtually no credible or consistent empirical evidence supporting the belief that harsher criminal sanctions deter crime,” Prof. Webster said. Gerard Kennedy, an assistant professor of law at the University of Alberta, said lawyers for an alleged fentanyl dealer would have “more than a plausible case,” based on court rulings in recent years, to argue that life in prison is a cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of the Charter’s Section 12. He said the Conservatives’ proposal focuses on the severity of dealing fentanyl, which is a factor when courts consider Section 12.

Poilievre would tear down trade barriers; Inter-provincial,2025.0,"OTTAWA . Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling for Canada to drop long-standing trade barriers between provinces to lessen the impact of American trade uncertainties. ""Canada's new top trading partner will be . Canada,"" said Poilievre in a video posted to social media on Monday morning, outlining his plan to ""massively increase"" internal trade between the provinces. Poilievre said he would overhaul Canada's unsuccessful internal trade agreement if he is elected prime minister, promising to meet with Canada's premiers in his first 30 days to remove as many trade barrier clauses as possible. The current agreement has 133 pages' worth of carve-outs, exempting such goods as alcoholic beverages, cannabis and fireworks from interprovincial transport. A recent study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that getting rid of these sorts of internal trade barriers could boost Canada's GDP by up to $200 billion annually. Poilievre said that if the Conservatives win the next election, he'll reward provinces with a ""free trade bonus"" each time they remove a trade barrier. The bonus will be set by calculating the resulting GDP boost from the deregulation, with the province getting an equivalent federal transfer. Sean Stephenson, a trade specialist with law firm Dentons, said the bonus could shortchange certain provinces, specifically Alberta, which has already removed most or all barriers to interprovincial trade, while rewarding those who have been less co-operative to date. ""If the idea is to compensate laggards that haven't already taken action, I can see a few provinces pushing back on that,"" said Stephenson. Alberta unilaterally eliminated most of its barriers to imports from other provinces in 2019. Stephenson said Alberta would be well within its rights to demand compensation for its past actions to promote internal trade. Poilievre also said on Monday that he would take action as prime minister to standardize trucking rules, which often require truckers to adhere to different standards in different provinces. He also promised to set up a Canada-wide ""Blue Seal"" licensing standard for doctors, nurses and engineers, something he has already been promising to do.""

"Relations with China cratered under Trudeau. Will his exit spark a rebound?:   The Prime Minister’s departure could wipe the slate clean, but any Conservative government under Pierre Poilievre is likely to be far more hawkish",2025.0,"When Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly visited Beijing last year, her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, acknowledged that there had been ""twists and turns"" in the Sino-Canadian relationship but said China wanted to ""inject momentum into the restoration of normal relations."" Since that July trip, there has been little obvious progress, but as China enters the Year of the Snake – a time of renewal, of letting go of the past – two major obstacles to improving ties are sliding out of view. One was the publication on Jan. 28 of Justice Marie-Josée Hogue’s final report into foreign interference in Canadian politics, long a point of contention between Beijing and Ottawa. The other is the imminent exit of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose government has presided over the decline in relations with China, including testy personal exchanges with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Whether Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party can hang on to power under his successor – most likely former finance minister Chrystia Freeland or former central banker Mark Carney – or if it is turfed out by Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives, the end of the Prime Minister’s decade in office provides at least a chance of wiping the slate clean with one of the country’s most important trading partners, Chinese analysts told The Globe and Mail. ""A change of political party and a change of leader should bring an opportunity,"" said Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China in Beijing. However, Prof. Wang and other experts wonder how far any Canadian government would go in repairing ties when the U.S., under President Donald Trump, seems poised to take an aggressive position against Beijing while also pressing Canada on trade and other issues. Liu Jiangyun, a Chinese international politics risk analyst, said any ""chance of a turnaround in China-Canada relations hinges on whether there will be a détente in the Trump administration’s China policy or whether the U.S. will be distracted by new crisis elsewhere."" ""The key to the stability of China-Canada relations is whether Canada can adjust its strategic perception,"" she said. ""Unless Canada returns to the diplomatic tradition of a middle power and reinvents its strategic autonomy, it will be difficult to see a real warming of Sino-Canadian relations."" One potential model for improving ties with China while maintaining close alignment with the U.S. is Australia. Relations between Canberra and Beijing entered a deep freeze under conservative prime minister Scott Morrison but have improved dramatically since 2022, when a Labor government led by Anthony Albanese came to power. ""They’ve shown enough sensibility by softening their tone, adopting a conciliatory approach and making symbolic gestures, which has significantly eased tensions with Beijing,"" Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations expert, told the South China Morning Post this month. A new Liberal leader in Canada might be well-positioned to pull off a similar pivot, particularly Mr. Carney, who as governor of the Bank of England had numerous high-level meetings with Chinese officials and met Mr. Xi as recently as last March during a summit for top international finance executives in Beijing. Ms. Freeland has met with Chinese officials in her previous role as finance minister, but has also staked out a more aggressive public policy, saying the Liberal government – before she stepped down – was ""very aligned"" with Mr. Trump on China. But while Canada’s Liberal and Australia’s Labor parties have traditionally enjoyed better relations with China, Beijing may find making common cause with the Conservatives more difficult. The Globe has previously reported on top-secret Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents that suggest China favoured a Liberal minority government over the Conservatives in the 2021 election, and Mr. Poilievre has accused Mr. Trudeau of ignoring Chinese interference in that contest, something the Prime Minister has denied. Many leading critics of China’s human-rights record sit on the Conservative benches, including shadow foreign affairs minister Michael Chong, who was allegedly targeted by Beijing – as were his relatives in Hong Kong – as a result of his condemnation of China’s policies in that territory and in the Xinjiang region. Mr. Poilievre has been equally outspoken, accusing China of committing genocide against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, criticizing Chinese actions in the South China Sea and calling on Canadians to ""stand up to the Communist government in Beijing."" He has also attacked the Trudeau government’s membership in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which he described as ""controlled by Beijing and designed to build the infrastructure of Beijing’s Communist empire throughout Asia."" (Ottawa has since frozen its involvement in the bank amid questions about Chinese influence.) Describing Mr. Poilievre as ""more hawkish and radical in his policy toward China than Trudeau,"" Ms. Liu said she was skeptical that a Conservative government under his leadership would make much headway in repairing ties with Beijing. However, while relations may continue to slide under such a government, Ms. Liu noted that a Conservative government ""does have two advantages in dealing with relations with China."" ""First, Sino-Canadian relations have fallen to the freezing point during Trudeau’s term, and any positive action can be seen as a sign of warming relations, to which China would be expected to react positively,"" she said. Secondly, the Conservatives may take a more pragmatic ""and less high-minded"" approach toward China than Mr. Trudeau’s government. This could follow a pattern seen during Stephen Harper’s time in office. The one-time critic of Beijing’s human-rights record eventually improved economic ties between China and Canada.

Diane Sullivan, Toronto Promote trade with provinces, new partners Trudeau says U.S. tariffs will be paused for 30 days; Ontario halts Starlink cancellation, liquor removal, Feb. 3 U.S. President Donald Trump is like a warning shot across our bow. Let's not invest all our eggs in one basket. Diversify. We need a government that promotes Canadian interprovincial trade and the development of new trade partners. We now know the U.S. is not a trustworthy trade partner anymore. David Miller, Keswick, Ont. Canada should close our border for 'maintenance' Electricity suppliers in both Ontario and Quebec need to shut off the supply to the U.S. for maintenance immediately. The oil pipelines from Alberta to Republican states need to be shut down for environmental inspections immediately. We will notify the White House when they'll be operational again. Our end of the international bridges may be unsafe. Our engineers have to conduct thorough inspections to determine if remediation is required. Therefore, American cargo destined for Canada needs to remain on the American side until the status of the structure is determined to be safe. We wouldn't want to risk American lives. Mark Buczek, Milton Extra security could stop guns, drugs at border Pierre Poilievre calls on Ottawa to send troops to the Canada-U.S. border, Feb. 3 Sending troops to patrol the Canada-U.S. border sounds like a great idea, but not for the reasons Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and U.S. President Donald Trump are giving. If the U.S. Border Patrol can't stop illegal drugs and firearms from crossing over into Canada, extra security on the Canadian side should be able to catch them coming in. Pretty sure that there will be far more guns and drugs caught going north than drugs going south. Michael Bines, Toronto Two good news stories lost amid the U.S. chaos Lost in all the awful noise created by U.S. President Donald Trump are two ""good news"" stories. First, America's national bird, the bald eagle, has been taken off the endangered species list as its population has rebounded. Second, Canada's new national bird, a special one-finger salute directed toward Trump, is thriving. Go Canada. Patrick Stewart, Toronto City should use empty ad spaces on TTC vehicles If you ride the subway these days, you'll notice there are quite a lot of empty advertising spaces. If those advertising spaces are going unused - if there aren't enough paying customers for those spaces - couldn't the city of Toronto to use those spaces to advertise city facilities, services and programs? Could it be possible to have city of Toronto ads (or provincial ads or federal ads) available on ""stand by"" to be put into advertising spaces that would otherwise go empty? If ad spaces on the TTC are not generating revenue, then they might as well be used to inform riders of publicly funded things that they could use. Paul Kern, Toronto Ford squeezed our universities without mandate Doug Ford hasn't needed a mandate to make major changes in Toronto. So why does he need one for Donald Trump? Feb. 2 Shawn Micallef is bang on when he says Premier Doug Ford did a lot without a mandate. One thing he missed was Ford's decision to cut university tuition by 10 per cent across the board and freeze any tuition increases. He did not campaign on this. This action, combined with no increase in funds to universities, has resulted in a situation where universities are operating with 2014 budgets but paying 2025 prices. Even after his own hand-selected ""blue ribbon"" task force said this was unsustainable, he did not change course. What is more disappointing is that the Ontarians, who repeatedly indicate strong interest in university education for their children, do not seem to care that the universities are being choked of funds, and that the inevitable outcome is fewer seats for their kids. In a world full of misinformation, universities are central to knowledge creation, preservation and critical thinking. Dan Malleck, St. Catharines, Ont.

PC Leader Doug Ford talks trade - and bourbon - in Ottawa campaign stop,2025.0,"Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford had a fire in his belly and was talking bourbon Tuesday as he addressed U.S. President Donald Trump and his on-again, off-again promises to impose stiff tariffs on Canadian goods. After Trump hit the pause button on planned 25-per-cent tariffs Monday, Ford reversed course on his plan to have U.S. alcohol removed from LCBO shelves. That would have included everything from California wine to Kentucky bourbon. Ford wants to continue to negotiate with Trump, who says he will revisit the tariff question March 1. But Ford says the change in the president's tone early this week is at least partly the result of hearing loud complaints from those against his tax plan, including U.S. alcohol producers worried about lost sales in Canada. ""It's about working together and explaining to the American people,"" Ford said during a provincial election campaign stop at an east Ottawa window and door manufacturing company. ""That's where the pressure comes. The pressure comes from the senators, the governors, the congresswomen and men who are getting calls from their constituents, shouting up and down and screaming."" The LCBO, Ford says, carries 3,600 products from 35 U.S. states and 2,000 companies. ""There's one thing I've learned,"" he said. ""Don't mess with people's booze. They lose their minds. People love their bourbon. It's their country, their state, their religion and then bourbon, in Kentucky ... That's how it goes."" At the same time, Ford says, nobody can afford to relax, believing that Trump has completely abandoned his tariff plan. As much as he dislikes Trump's approach, Ford acknowledges that the U.S. president was a smart negotiator and said, ""Uncertainty is the only certainty."" ""We have to work together and we have been working together,"" Ford said, hammering home the point that discussions can't be one-sided in making sure the U.S. doesn't take advantage of Ontario. ""I'm talking about the most serious situation the country has ever seen. I think it's even more serious than the pandemic. This is someone who is targetting Ontario. You know why he's targetting Ontario? Because we're an economic powerhouse now."" Indeed, the looming presence of Trump is here, there and everywhere during the Ontario election. Without his loud words and daily social media rants, Ontario's housing and health issues would be at the forefront of the campaign. Instead, Ford spent a good part of Tuesday's session with reporters talking about a hot mic incident on Monday. Ford was heard saying that he had been happy Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election until Trump went on his tariff crusade. ""I can work with anyone, I don't care who it is. I just thoughts thing might be a little different,"" Ford said. ""I believe in people that want to put money back into people's pockets. I believe in elected officials, no matter what stripe, lowering taxes on people, on businesses. That's economics 101."" Ontario NDP leader Marit Stiles and Ontario Liberal boss Bonnie Crombie were also on the campaign trail Tuesday and said Ford's live mic incident spoke volumes. ""I think the fact that he keeps saying one thing in front of you and another thing behind doors tells you everything you need to know about Doug Ford,"" Stiles said. Crombie said the comments revealed what Ford was all about. ""I think that statement, caught on a hot mic, when he didn't know other people could be listening, shows his true character,"" Crombie said. kwarren@postmedia.com Our website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark our homepage and sign up for our newsletters so we can keep you informed.

Poilievre pitches provincial 'free trade',2025.0,"As Canadians braced for a trade war with the United States, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Canada should look inward to end it reliance on the U.S. export market. ""Canada's new top trading partner will be... Canada,"" said Poilievre in a video posted to social media on Monday morning, outlining his plan to ""massively increase"" internal trade between the provinces. Poilievre said he would overhaul Canada's internal trade agreement as prime minister, promising to meet with Canada's premiers in his first 30 days to remove as many trade barrier clauses as possible. The current agreement has 133 pages worth of carveouts, exempting such goods as alcoholic beverages, cannabis and fireworks from interprovincial transport. A recent study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that getting rid of these sorts of internal trade barriers could boost Canada's GDP by up to $200 billion annually. Poilievre said he'll reward provinces with a ""free trade bonus"" each time they remove a trade barrier. The bonus will be set by calculating the resulting GDP boost, with the province getting an equivalent federal transfer. Sean Stephenson, a trade specialist with law firm Dentons, said that the bonus could shortchange provinces like Alberta that have already removed most or all of its internal barriers to trade. ""If the idea is to compensate laggards that haven't already taken action, I can see a few provinces pushing back on that,"" said Stephenson. Alberta unilaterally eliminated most of its barriers to imports from other provinces in 2019. Stephenson said Alberta would be well within its bounds to demand compensation for its past actions to promote internal trade. Poilievre also said on Monday that he would take action as prime minister to standardize trucking rules and set up a Canada-wide ""Blue Seal"" licensing standard for doctors, nurses and engineers, the latter of which he's already promised. Getting rid of interprovincial trade barriers is an idea that enjoys substantial support across party lines. Federal Transport Minister Anita Anand, who is also the government's lead on internal trade, has spoken regularly on the economic urgency of removing these barriers.

Trump trade war doubles Ford PC lead in Ontario election race: Poll; Trump trade war doubles Ford PC lead in Ontario election race: Poll,2025.0,"Impending American tariffs have given the Doug Ford PCs their highest approval ratings in nearly a year, new polling suggests. The Liaison Strategies poll, commissioned by the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada (NEPMCC,) found the Ontario Progressive Conservatives doubled their lead over the previous week, pulling a 43 per cent approval rating among decided and leaning voters compared to the Bonnie Crombie Liberals at 31 per cent between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. The PCs were polled 39 per cent against a Liberal 33 per cent the week previous, the closest the two parties have come in a year. ""Ford focused his campaign on tariffs and the trade war from the very start and, for now, that is paying dividends with Ontarians,"" said David Valentin, principal at Liaison Strategies. Valentin said the Ontario Liberals have two bright spots - their lead in the City of Toronto and their dead heat in the province's north. Indeed, the 416 remains the Liberals' trusty stronghold, where they're pulling 33 per cent support compared to the PC's 27 per cent. Toronto's undecided vote, currently sitting at a quarter of respondents, could still play a factor. Likewise, the province's undecided vote dwells around the same range across all locations and demographics - PC support for the ever-important 18-34 age range currently sits at 29 per cent, just two points ahead of that cohort's undecided vote. Fortunes for the Marit Stiles NDP, however, continue to slide. ""There is no good news in this report for the Ontario NDP, who continue to slide and are now down to 16 per cent,"" Valentin said. ""In south-central Ontario, Hamilton and Niagara, they are trailing the PCs by 13 points, despite the fact they have been first or a close second all throughout the year."" NDP support has seen a precipitous decline since their late-summer high of 23 per cent, with this week's 16 per cent representing their lowest ratings in a year. The poll was conducted between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 with 1,274 Ontario voters. The poll's margin of error is ± 2.74 per cent, 19 times out of 20. bpassifiume@postmedia.com","The Windsor Star; Windsor, Ont.","Windsor, Ont.",Bryan Pas Sifiume,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 4, 2025",Trade disputes; Voters; Tariffs,,2025-02-04,The Windsor Star

A recent study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that getting rid of these sorts of internal trade barriers could boost Canada's GDP by up to $200 billion annually. Poilievre said he'll reward provinces with a ""free trade bonus"" each time they remove a trade barrier. The bonus will be set by calculating the resulting GDP boost, with the province getting an equivalent federal transfer. Sean Stephenson, a trade specialist with law firm Dentons, said that the bonus could shortchange provinces like Alberta that have already removed most or all of its internal barriers to trade. ""If the idea is to compensate laggards that haven't already taken action, I can see a few provinces pushing back on that,"" said Stephenson. Alberta unilaterally eliminated most of its barriers to imports from other provinces in 2019. Stephenson said Alberta would be well within its bounds to demand compensation for its past actions to promote internal trade. Poilievre also said on Monday that he would take action as prime minister to standardize trucking rules and set up a Canada-wide ""Blue Seal"" licensing standard for doctors, nurses and engineers, the latter of which he's already promised. Getting rid of interprovincial trade barriers is an idea that enjoys substantial support across party lines. Federal Transport Minister Anita Anand, who is also the government's lead on internal trade, has spoken regularly on the economic urgency of removing these barriers.

Poilievre calls on Ottawa to send troops to border,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the federal government to send Canadian soldiers to the Canada-U.S. border, hours after Mexico staved off U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans for 30 days by agreeing to deploy thousands of troops to its own shared border. ""We must recall Parliament now and put Liberal party power struggles aside so that we can adopt this plan to save our people and secure our borders,"" Poilievre told reporters in Vancouver on Monday. ""The plan: immediately deploy military troops, helicopters and surveillance to the border to spot and intercept risks."" The Conservative leader's demand was made before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secured a tariff delay of his own, which saw Trump's order to impose a 25 per cent tariff on almost all Canadian goods - and a 10 per cent tariff on Canadian energy products - also postponed for 30 days. The proposal to station troops at the border was promptly quashed by Transport and Internal Trade Minister Anita Anand, who counts the defence file among her previous portfolios. ""To be clear, President Trump has not asked for this. There is no plan to deploy the Canadian Armed Forces to the border at the current time,"" Anand told the Star in an interview. The clashing comments come as new political battles emerge in the wake of Trump's order, with opposition leaders and Liberal leadership contenders each seeking to platform their proposed responses as the best path forward. Poilievre's plan, framed as an attempt to ""take back control of the border,"" included previous calls to beef up security with more border agents and implement new monitoring technologies like high-powered scanners, border surveillance towers and truck-mounted drone systems. Poilievre said he would also ""expand powers of (Canada Border Services Agency) border agents to patrol anywhere along the border, not just at official border crossings."" On Monday, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said Ottawa should pull CBSA ""in under our military,"" arguing that the move would open up the possibility ""for troops along our border"" and allow for Canada to count border funding as ""military investment"" that ""would be part of ensuring we are working towards our two per cent NATO (spending) commitment."" Earlier in the day, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum struck an agreement with Trump to hold off his tariff response targeting that country by one month, by pledging to swiftly send 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border. Sending Canadian troops to the border was not mentioned in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's list of new pledges announced Monday. Anand also took aim Monday at another of Poilievre's demands to respond to the now-postponed trade war: eliminating, at long last, many of the country's interprovincial trade barriers. Improving trade within Canada, instead of outside it, has recently resurfaced as a means to counter America's increasingly protectionist policies. Poilievre released a seven-and-a-half minute video on X Monday morning to that effect, promising that within 30 days of becoming prime minister, he would work with premiers to scrap the myriad exemptions to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement that continue to hamper interprovincial trade. One of those, he said, would be to implement a standard set of trucking rules to improve the movement of goods. Another would be changing licensing rules to allow people like nurses and doctors to work more freely across the country. Poilievre cited a 2022 report from economist Trevor Tombe that found that reducing barriers would give a $200-billion boost to the economy. Anand said she has already made progress on some of those demands, and has also used those same statistics. ""I am surprised that he is coming to this issue so late, so late in the game,"" she said. Trudeau and Anand have raised the issue with Canada's premiers in recent weeks, with Anand meeting with her provincial and territorial trade counterparts last Friday. ""We have very strong recommendations that we are presenting to the prime minister and the premiers for their Wednesday meeting this week,"" she said.

Poilievre says he'll tear down provincial trade barriers after U.S. tariff havoc,2025.0,"OTTAWA - On what was expected to be the eve of a massive trade war with the United States, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called for Canada to drop longstanding trade barriers between provinces to lessen the impact of American trade uncertainties. U.S. tariffs were to take effect on Tuesday, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday afternoon that the two countries had agreed to a 30-day delay. ""Our new top trading partner will be... Canada,"" said Poilievre in a video posted to social media on Monday morning, outlining his plan to ""massively increase"" internal trade between the provinces. Poilievre said he would overhaul Canada's unsuccessful internal trade agreement if he is elected prime minister, promising to meet with Canada's premiers in his first 30 days to remove as many trade barrier clauses as possible. The current agreement has 133 pages' worth of carve-outs, exempting such goods as alcoholic beverages, cannabis and fireworks from interprovincial transport. A recent study by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that getting rid of these sorts of internal trade barriers could boost Canada's GDP by up to $200 billion annually Poilievre said that if the Conservatives win the next election, he'll reward provinces with a ""free trade bonus"" each time they remove a trade barrier. The bonus will be set by calculating the resulting GDP boost from the deregulation, with the province getting an equivalent federal transfer. President Trump toys with annexing Canada as 51st state as trade war looms Trump touts tariffs, North America is divided Trevor Tombe, an economist with the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy, said that the bonus could be a creative way to get around the federal government's general lack of constitutional jurisdiction over things like professional licensing standards, safety regulations, and other trade frictions. ""It's encouraging to see that (Poilievre's) proposal is putting on the table what the feds do have, and that's spending power,"" said Tombe. Sean Stephenson, a trade specialist with law firm Dentons, said that the bonus could shortchange certain provinces, specifically Alberta, which has already removed most or all barriers to interprovincial trade, while rewarding those who have been less co-operative to date. ""If the idea is to compensate laggards that haven't already taken action, I can see a few provinces pushing back on that,"" said Stephenson. Alberta unilaterally eliminated most of its barriers to imports from other provinces in 2019. Stephenson said Alberta would be well within its rights to demand compensation for its past actions to promote internal trade. Tombe said he disagreed, noting that the trade exemptions scapped by Alberta under ex-premier Jason Kenney were more symbolic than substantial. ""Kenney did that to start a national conversation,"" said Tombe, adding that the start of the COVID pandemic in early 2020 derailed Kenney's plans for a second wave of more meaningful changes. ""Alberta maintains about as many barriers as everyone else, because these barriers are largely just regulations that differ from one province to the next,"" said Tombe. Poilievre also said on Monday that he would take action as prime minister to standardize trucking rules, which often require truckers to adhere to different standards in different provinces. He also promised to set up a Canada-wide ""Blue Seal"" licensing standard for doctors, nurses and engineers, something he has already been promising to do Tombe called this a good start, but stressed that it wouldn't be a silver bullet solution to the damage done by future U.S. tariffs, as it would take years to realize gains from freer internal trade. ""Gains come in the form of some firms expanding and others contracting,"" said Tombe. ""You're basically nudging growth a few tenths of a point per year."" Getting rid of interprovincial trade barriers is an idea that enjoys support across federal party lines. Federal Transport Minister Anita Anand, who is also the Liberal government's lead on internal trade, has spoken regularly on the economic urgency of removing these barriers Christopher Kukucha, a professor of Canadian intergovernmental relations at the University of Lethbridge, says there's a good reason the rhetoric on internal trade hasn't added up to results, pointing to the benefits of internal trade barriers for some businesses. ""Many of the industries protected by internal trade benefit from the lack of competition as they have difficulty competing in open markets. Some provincial governments also enjoy the revenue generated from regulating these barriers.""

Trump trade war doubles Ford PC lead in Ontario election race: Poll,2025.0,"By: Bryan Passifiume OTTAWA - Impending American tariffs have given the Doug Ford PCs their highest approval ratings in nearly a year, new polling suggests. The Liaison Strategies poll , commissioned by the National Ethnic Press and Media Council of Canada (NEPMCC,) found the Ontario Progressive Conservatives doubled their lead over the previous week, pulling a 43 per cent approval rating among decided and leaning voters compared to the Bonnie Crombie Liberals at 31 per cent between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. The PCs were polled 39 per cent against a Liberal 33 per cent the week previous, the closest the two parties have come in a year. ""Ford focused his campaign on tariffs and the trade war from the very start and, for now, that is paying dividends with Ontarians,"" said David Valentin, principal at Liaison Strategies. Valentin said the Ontario Liberals have two bright spots - their lead in the City of Toronto and their dead heat in the province's north. Indeed, the 416 remains the Liberals' trusty stronghold, where they're pulling 33 per cent support compared to the PC's 27 per cent. Toronto's undecided vote, currently sitting at a quarter of respondents, could still play a factor.

Likewise, the province's undecided vote dwells around the same range across all locations and demographics - PC support for the ever-important 18-34 age range currently sits at 29 per cent, just two points ahead of that cohort's undecided vote. Fortunes for the Marit Stiles NDP, however, continue to slide. ""There is no good news in this report for the Ontario NDP, who continue to slide and are now down to 16 per cent,"" Valentin said. ""In southcentral Ontario, Hamilton and Niagara, they are trailing the PCs by 13 points, despite the fact they have been first or a close second all throughout the year."" NDP support has seen a precipitous decline since their late-summer high of 23 per cent, with this week's 16 per cent representing their lowest ratings in a year. The poll was conducted between Jan. 31 and Feb. 1 with 1,274 Ontario voters.

Roughriders sign free agent DB Tevaughn Campbell,2025.0,"The Saskatchewan Roughriders have added a speedy Canadian defensive back with CFL and NFL experience to the roster. Tevaughn Campbell, a former University of Regina Rams standout, signed with the Roughriders on Monday after spending the last six years south of the border. After starring in football and track and field at the University of Regina from 2011-14, the Scarborough, Ont. product was originally drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in the third round of the 2015 CFL Draft after running a 4.35 second 40-yard dash at the combine. Campbell, 31, played five games with the Stampeders in his rookie season before being traded to the Roughriders in 2016 for a fourth-round draft pick. Regina Rams' Tevaughn Campbell runs the ball back against the Calgary Dinos in Regina, SK, on Friday, September 6, 2013. The 6-foot-0, 200-pounder appeared in 17 games for Saskatchewan that year, registering his first career interception, before being traded, along with two third-round picks, to the Montreal Alouettes in exchange for quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. And a fifth-round pick. Campbell, who has also played with Canada's national rugby team, spent two years with the Alouettes, playing in 20 games in 2017 and 2018, before signing with the NFL's New York Jets in 2019. He attended Jets training camp before ending up on the Los Angeles Chargers' practice roster. Tevaughn Campbell with the Saskatchewan Roughriders during practice at Mosaic Stadium. He went on to make his NFL debut with the Chargers in 2020 and ended up playing 30 games, including 11 starts. Over two seasons, he racked up 63 tackles, seven deflections, three forced fumbles, a fumble recovery returned for a touchdown and an interception returned for a touchdown. After being let go by the Chargers following camp in 2022, Campbell briefly joined the Las Vegas Raiders before signing with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He went on to play seven games over the next two seasons with the team before being released following training camp in 2024. Campbell now comes back to the CFL where he has the chance to be a ratio-breaking defensive back on a Roughriders team seeking two starting cornerbacks as Marcus Sayles, Amari Henderson and Deontai Williams, the three players who primarily played corner in 2024, are all pending free agents. In his CFL career, Campbell has 46 defensive tackles, eight special teams tackles, four interceptions, two forced fumbles and one sack in 42 career games. Riders add receiver The Roughriders also added an American receiver to the mix on Monday as the club announced the signing of Wayne Ruby Jr. The 24-year-old target comes to Saskatchewan after a collegiate career at the University of Mount Union, a NCAA Div III school where he spent five seasons. In his carer, the Florida product was named the Ohio Athletic Conference receiver of the year for three straight seasons from 2021-23. In 2022, 6-foot-1, 190-pounder racked up a career-high 1,785 receiving yards in 14 games for an average of 127.5 yards per game. That season, he also caught 30 touchdown passes. He finished his career with 362 receptions for 5,624 yards and 74 touchdowns in 56 games with the Purple Raiders, which are all school records.

Neil Sharma: This is what Poilievre's Canada First movement should look like,2025.0,"Synonymous with ""Make America Great Again"" is ""America First,"" which proved much more than a campaign-trail rallying cry ahead of President's Donald Trump's election. In Canada, there's nary a doubt Tory leader Pierre Poilievre, who smells blood in the water, is trying to capture the same energy with his recent casual use of ""Canada first."" In fact, Poilievre made eight such references during a 20-minute news conference on Jan. 9. And while there's merit in branding Canadians' next visit to the polls the ""carbon tax election,"" Canada's probable next prime minister is wise to remind voters just how much their quality of life has deteriorated. ""We will take back control of immigration, take back control of spending, take back control of our borders, take back control of inflation, taxes and interest rates,"" Poilievre said. ""The choice will be simple: either the NDP-Liberals, who tax your food, punish your work, double your housing costs, unleash crime and chaos, and weakness on the world stage, or the common-sense Conservatives who will axe the (carbon) tax, build homes, fix the budget, stop crime, and put Canada first."" Indeed, it's high time for the Canada First movement. Consider Justin Trudeau's interview with New York Times Magazine just days after he was sworn in as Canada's 23rd prime minister in 2015: ""There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,"" the then-tyro PM said. ""There are shared values - openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first postnational state."" Whatever a ""postnational state"" is, it was neither Canada pre-2015 nor is it Canada today. Trudeau's words were a harbinger of a corrosive agenda to upend western societies and supplant local issues with raucous foreign grievances Canada is hardly alone; Britons were brazenly insulted recently when a radical ideologue suggested iconic Remembrance Day poppies become Poppies for Palestine. A cogent Canada First movement is long overdue - and we enjoyed a taste in February 2022 when the Freedom Convoy, a proto-Canada First movement, proved Canadians aren't torpid by descending upon Ottawa to peacefully protest pandemic restrictions on liberty and advocate for the country's working people. The convoy's uniquely Canadian energy was so strong that it inspired the world However, insofar as Poilievre has elucidated his Canada First vision, it's largely focused on inchoate, if low-hanging, economic policies like eliminating the carbon tax, a poverty-inducing globalist instrument, and minor amendments to make housing more affordable, at least putatively. He's also vowed to fight Trump's looming tariff war with ""fire,"" but, considering the American president is an ideological counterpart, there are better approaches, such as reviving Keystone XL make more sense. Not only does Trump already consider the idea copacetic, Canadians and Americans are cultural siblings between whom unity is paramount. Poilievre could also build better ties with the U.S. by strengthening Canada's military, as he indicated he'd do if elected, rather than freeloading off its neighbour to the south. Despite Canada's commitment to NATO of spending two per cent of its GDP on defence, it only spends 1.33 per cent. Although that's good enough for 14th highest in the world, Canada can climb the ranks if Poilievre follows through. However, there's much more at stake than that. Canada became balkanized along ethno-cultural and -religious lines not long after it declared itself a multicultural state, but the answer to this existential threat can be found internally. Quebec, the country's second largest province, is a society which welcomes pluralism so long as newcomers adopt the French language and Québécois values. Secularism is one of those values, and a crucial one that protects the integrity of Quebec's egalitarian society by rejecting religious accommodation. By contrast, the Anglosphere is cowed by the ever-present spectre of frivolous racism accusations. On Thursday, Quebec's government tabled Bill 84, An Act respecting national integration, which is underpinned by intercultural principles that countervail the opaque multiculturalism that Ottawa has long foisted upon it. And amid a population boom, Jean-François Roberge, the Coalition Avenir Québec's minister of immigration, francization and integration, warned that laissez-faire multiculturalism is a path toward ""ghettoization."" ""We will be pretty clear: we are a nation, we have a culture, we have democratic values, men and women are equal. People coming here must accept that,"" he said. Pluralism can enrich a society, provided a harmonious cultural rubric exists and is enforced, but a multicultural state with nominal borders often results in cultural dilution, suspicion and resentment, and eventually civil strife and violence The majority of newcomers to Canada in the last few years aren't permanent residents; they're non-resident permit workers, and in light of meagre economic prospects for Canadians and the newly arrived alike, mass immigration has atomized and destabilized Canada. The record number of annually settled permanent residents and permit workers has worsened Canada's existing housing and rental affordability crises, while surpressing wage growth. Economic activity has become so truncated in the last couple of years that some newcomers have returned to their countries of origin, while scores more - many of whom entered the country through student VISA scams - can only find work in the gig economy and have, consequently, metastasized Canada's underclass. And Canadian taxpayers, who have long footed the bill for social assistance and family reunification, are once again losers. If ""Canada first"" isn't a political platitude, a Poilievre-led government must immediately reform Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The agency, currently led by Trudeau's old university buddy, Marc Miller, was also in disarray under his predecessor Sean Fraser, who recently bailed on the embattled PM. Ahmed Hussen - the one-time Diversity and Inclusion minister who's department infamously hired an antisemitic consultant for anti-racism training - once helmed the maladroit IRCC, too. Former prime minister Stephen Harper, an economist, wisely appointed the late Jim Flaherty as his finance minister. Among Flaherty's accomplishments during his eight-year tenure was stymieing the Big Six banks' attempt to fix mortgage rates. Harper's successor, on other hand, prioritizes optics over competency, resulting in a revolving door of grand poobahs like erstwhile journalist Chrystia Freeland, who's occupied the same post as Flaherty. It's clear that Poilievre is playing it safe by sticking to economic talking points, probably reasoning that voters for whom cultural issues are imperative will cast ballots in his favour anyway. But real leaders aren't milquetoast, they're bold. And after a decade at the mercy of Trudeau, a leader contemptuous of the electorate, Canada is reeling. Now it's time for Poilievre to show Canadians how bold he is by putting them first.

"Poilievre calls for soldiers at Canada-U.S. border in response to Trump:   Conservative Leader says increased border surveillance will also stem flow of weapons, drugs from U.S.",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants Canadian soldiers sent to the border as part of a broader plan he says would both save Canada-U.S. trade and also serve Canada’s national security interest. Mr. Poilievre is calling for the immediate dispatch of soldiers, along with helicopters and surveillance. He says there should also be the addition of at least 2,000 border agents, the expansion of Canada Border Services Agency powers, and the installation of additional border surveillance equipment, including new towers and drones. His call followed a decision by the U.S. President Donald Trump earlier Monday to delay the imposition of tariffs on Mexico after that country announced it would send 10,000 national guard troops to its own border with the U.S. In laying out his border-security plan, Mr. Poilievre cited the flow of illegal firearms into Canada from the U.S., as well as illegal drugs. He also criticized the Liberal government for losing control of immigration and notes recent cases of alleged criminals who first came to Canada before entering the U.S. ""President Trump’s administration has raised concerns and has put that as a rationale for imposing tariffs on Canada. These tariffs and these threats are wrong and unjustified, but it should not take a leader of a foreign country for the Liberals to scramble to fix their disastrous, broken border policy,"" Mr. Poilievre in a video posted to social media Monday. ""I will take back control of our borders."" Chief of the Defence Staff Jennie Carignan told the Globe and Mail last year the military was ready to deploy helicopters or surveillance if necessary, to support organizations responsible for border security. ""There is no intention to militarize the border,"" she said at the time. Her comments came just after the Liberal government pledged to spend $1.3-billion over six years to bolster the Canada-U.S. border after Mr. Trump raised concerns about migration and drug smuggling and demanded Canada do more or face tariffs. The money includes the dispatch of more surveillance equipment, including drones and helicopters, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday some of those new tools were already being deployed. But on Saturday, Mr. Trump imposed 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian products and 10-per-cent levies on Canadian energy, to take effect Tuesday. Mr. Trudeau then announced Canada will retaliate by imposing tariffs on billions worth of U.S. products. Economists say the tariffs could push Canada into a recession, with job losses linked to a drop in demand in the face of higher prices. Mr. Poilievre said on Monday that if he’s elected, he’d convene the premiers to bring down current barriers to internal trade, and prioritize an agreement on one standard set of trucking rules that would ease intra-provincial transportation. He’d also create a licensing standard for doctors, nurses and engineers so they could work anywhere in Canada once certified. Mr. Poilievre had first proposed that idea during his leadership race in 2022. He would also offer provinces a bonus to get better national free trade deals in place, saying those deals would generate more revenue that he’d in turn return to provinces.

Mr. Poilievre goes to synagogue:   The Conservative Leader’s speech to a Jewish congregation in Vancouver this weekend was met with both admiration and outrage,2025.0,"Not everyone was on board with the special speaker planned for a Vancouver synagogue Sunday afternoon. Still, when Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre entered Temple Sholom, most in attendance got on their feet, offering the warmest welcome on an unusually snowy day – the first of several standing ovations he would receive during his 40-minute speech. But there had been tension leading up to this moment. As if anticipating opposition, the synagogue’s head rabbi, Dan Moskovitz, explained in an e-mail announcing the event that, ""hosting an elected national leader of a major political party in Canada to speak to our community is not an endorsement of that leader, their party, policies or rhetoric,"" noting that Justin Trudeau had also spoken there. Mr. Poilievre has become popular with segments of the Jewish community for his vocal support of Israel and opposition to antisemitism, in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel and the war in Gaza that followed. So he might seem like a natural guest speaker at a synagogue – even a progressive reform synagogue that describes itself as an ""LGBTQ safe zone."" Not everyone was buying it. Some community members voiced their opposition to this event on social media; others contacted the synagogue directly. Some were particularly upset that there would be no opportunity for questions, including around trans rights; the Conservative Leader has claimed he was ""not aware of any other genders than men and women."" A community dialogue was one thing; a campaign speech, quite another. No doubt sensing this, the synagogue sent out a pre-event reminder urging attendees to allow for a ""respectful and meaningful gathering."" No placards or signs would be permitted; outbursts would not be tolerated; violators would be removed. As people lined up for security checks to enter, a handful of protesters outside shouted chants such as, ""hey hey, ho ho, transphobia has got to go."" Mr. Poilievre’s appearance came at a charged time. In his speech, he called U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs unjustified and unjustifiable: ""This attack on our sovereignty is unacceptable."" It was particularly galling, he said, that this comes ""from our neighbours for whom we have been a loyal and undying friend for centuries, with whom we have died on battlefields, that we have fought to defend."" (The event was closed to media; I was there as a synagogue member.) Many attendees nodded appreciatively. But the most enthusiastic response came when Mr. Poilievre addressed rising antisemitism in Canada. ""We have chaos in our streets with these rampant antisemitic rampages,"" he said. ""They’re not protests. They are conniption fits; a weird cocktail of extremists: religious extremists on the one hand and woke radicals on the other."" He said they could only agree on two things: ""they don’t like Canada and they don’t like Jews."" He made a vow: ""We will better screen and keep out terrorists and terrorist sympathizers from entering into Canada, and if anyone is here on a permit or visa who participates in antisemitic violence, they will be deported."" The crowd went wild. In his own remarks before Mr. Poilievre spoke, the rabbi said the members of his diverse congregation were not single-issue voters; they also care about the environment, health care and social justice. ""We are committed to upholding the rights, the protections and the dignity of our gay, lesbian, transgender a nd non-binary friends and family members."" Directing his comments to Mr. Poilievre, Mr. Moskovitz said: ""There are people in this room who fear that Canada’s promise of equality will no longer apply to [them]."" He quoted from the Torah, its instruction to love thy neighbour. ""I pray that you as a leader and that all Canadians will be guided by this biblical commandment of equality so central to both of our faiths and our national character,"" he said, ""and I hope that you will speak to those fears today as well."" If those remarks were performative, as one synagogue member suggested to me, they at least sounded sincere. Mr. Poilievre did address health care – saying he would make it easier for immigrant doctors and nurses to practise in Canada. On the environment, he spoke of liquefied natural gas and fracking as green saviours. But on LGBTQ rights, he was mum. After the event, the line-up to have a photo taken with Mr. Poilievre snaked around the large sanctuary. Who knows how this speech in this community will affect Mr. Poilievre’s campaign. But Mr. Poilievre’s impact on the community is already clear. That evening, a gay friend of mine wrote to the synagogue, saying that the space – which claims to be inclusive and egalitarian – is neither; it does not support queer and trans people. He told me he would never step foot in that synagogue again.

Poilievre wants the rich to stay rich,2025.0,"In the Friday, Jan. 24 StarPhoenix Pierre Poilievre said that his priority is ""anyone who works hard gets a powerful paycheque and a pension that buys affordable food, gas and homes in safe neighbourhoods."" Anyone who works hard - who decides what is hard? A powerful paycheque - what is a powerful paycheque? Many people can't get the jobs with ""powerful"" paycheques.

Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives raised record-setting $41.7-million in a year:   The party has long outpaced the Liberals and NDP in fundraising as they gear up for a looming federal election,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party raised a record-setting amount of money in 2024, newly-released financial records show. The party brought in $41.7-million in 2024, the most they have ever raised, according to Elections Canada. Of that, $12.8-million came in the final four months of the year, a period marked by major upheaval in federal politics. During that time, the NDP ended their supply-and-confidence agreement with the Liberals, placing the minority government back in a precarious state. Behind the scenes, Liberal MPs began agitating for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quit, the Bloc Québécois also pulled their support of the government and Parliament itself was paralyzed by a procedural fight. Then, in mid-December, Mr. Trudeau suffered a major blow when his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, quit on the day she was to deliver the fall economic statement. That month, the Conservatives say they raised $7.6-million – even with the Canada Post strike hindering the fundraising efforts of all non-profits. ""The incredible generosity of hard-working Canadians to the Conservative Party of Canada is directly correlated to the growing movement and resonance of Pierre Poilievre’s common sense message and promise to put Canada first,"" the party said in a statement accompanying the release of fundraising numbers Friday. The Conservatives have long outpaced their rival parties in fundraising. The Elections Canada filings show the Liberals as raising $5-million in the final four months of 2024, for a year-end total of $15.2-million. The NDP’s totals were not yet public on Friday morning. The Liberals are now in the midst of a leadership race. In a press release late Thursday night announcing their membership totals, the party said this past month has been their best-ever January for fundraising. Those figures won’t be available until the end of the first quarter of 2025.

Ford warns Poilievre on EV subsidies:   PC leader says he expects Ottawa to keep supporting auto sector no matter who's elected PM,2025.0,"Doug Ford took a veiled shot at federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre Thursday, warning ""whoever ends up being our next prime minister"" must continue electric-vehicle manufacturing subsidies. Aware that Poilievre, who polls suggest would win a national election expected as early as this spring, has questioned such corporate supports, Ford used his provincial campaign to highlight the need for government aid. The Progressive Conservative leader said if he is re-elected on Feb. 27, Queen's Park would maintain its share of funding for EV battery production subsidies to automakers even if U.S. President Donald Trump tears up the Inflation Reduction Act. Canada's subsidies, which could cost up to $13 billion for a new Volkswagen EV battery plant south of London alone, match former president Joe Biden's supports stateside and are designed to attract new investment and protect thousands of Ontario jobs. ""I expect whoever ends up being our next prime minister to do the exact same thing,"" Ford said here, a 30-minute drive north of the massive VW ""gigafactory"" under construction near St. Thomas. While he pointedly did not mention Poilievre by name, tensions between the more centrist provincial Tories and the more right-leaning federal party have festered for many months. ""Anyone who's prime minister needs to step up. They need to support the workers here in Ontario,"" said Ford, noting Trump has repeatedly said U.S. automakers should abandon Canada to build vehicles in America as he threatens 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian products as soon as Saturday. ""There's a bullet aimed straight at the heart of our auto sector,"" he said. Poilievre's office did not respond to Ford's barb. When the VW production tax credits were announced two years ago, Poilievre questioned the billions in spending that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - who worked closely with Ford on the aid - called a ""generational investment."" ""This money belongs to Canadians. Not to a foreign corporation. Not to Justin Trudeau,"" Poilievre said at the time, before asking the Parliamentary Budget Office to examine the deal. In Mississauga at the opening of her campaign office, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said she was ""concerned about the future of the (EV) sector."" That's in part because Ford ""has not worked to insulate our economy by putting all eggs in one basket."" ""It's not how I would operate. We needed to have diversified our economy,"" she said in a strip-plaza office in Mississauga East-Cooksville that previously housed a Jamaican grocery store. But Crombie, who supports the existing EV investments, emphasized that she would work with a potential Poilievre Conservative government in Ottawa to protect the auto industry. ""He and I served together while I was in Ottawa for that one term (as a Liberal MP). We have a very cordial relationship and I'm sure the door is open to enhance that,"" she said, noting they spoke recently and he praised her housing plan. NDP Leader Marit Stiles said she supports EV subsidies, and while ""there's been a lot of money invested at the federal and provincial government, I want to make sure that we protect all sectors, that we're standing up for all jobs."" Stiles spoke to reporters outside Queen's Park before boarding a campaign bus emblazoned with her photo and the party's slogan, ""On Your Side."" ""We have to see what the Trump government's really got planned for their country, and for ours,"" she said. ""But I can tell you one thing, I believe in the EV sector. It is important for the future of our own economy."" Stiles - who questioned Ford's prowess at deal-making after revelations Monday he spent an additional $612 million to expedite the liberalization of beer, wine and pre-mixed cocktail sales - said the Tory leader needs to be more on the ball. ""We're going to have to figure out ... how we're going to build our industry here, market our products here, if (Trump) is going to cut us off, if he's going to ramp it up with tariffs,"" she added. Ford is focusing his campaign on the fight against tariffs while opposition parties criticize Ontario's worsening doctor shortage, long emergency room waits, overcrowded schools, rising homelessness and an RCMP investigation into his government's $8.28-billion Greenbelt scandal. PC strategists hope the early election, which is costing $189 million and coming 15 months before the previously scheduled vote, secures Ford a third term before Poilievre can win federally. That's because Ontarians traditionally prefer different parties in power in Ottawa and Queen's Park at the same time. As the campaign heats up, Crombie's team is taking aim at some key downtown Toronto seats that the New Democrats won from the Liberals in 2018 and retained in 2022. In Toronto-St. Paul's, prominent broadcaster Stephanie Smyth is hoping to unseat two-term NDP MPP Jill Andrew, while in Spadina-Fort York, former local city council candidate April Engelberg is challenging MPP Chris Glover. Across town in the traditional NDP stronghold of Toronto-Danforth, Pan American Games silver medallist kayaker Connor Taras will try to topple veteran New Democrat Peter Tabuns.

Dangerous times: Could Poilievre's anti-woke agenda silence CMHR exhibit?,2025.0,"In museum exhibit curation, as in life, timing is everything. This week, Love in Dangerous Times: Canada’s LGBT Purge opens at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. The exhibit is a powerful and unflinching examination of how the federal government persecuted LGBTTQ+ employees in the Canadian Armed Forces, RCMP and federal public service. By the end of the purge — which ran from the 1950s to the early 1990s — more than 9,000 federal public servants had been harassed, investigated and fired. If you believe society becomes stronger and more resilient through exhibits and study that acknowledges our past mistakes, you better move fast. This exhibit, and ones like it, may become a thing of the past in the very near future. The man who would be prime minister, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, is on a self-described mission to rid the federal government and its associated institutions of “woke” culture. Along with being deeply profound and intensely poignant, Love in a Dangerous Time is most definitely woke, in the best sense of the word. In a recent interview with the Winnipeg Jewish Review, Poilievre talked in graphic terms about the steps he would take to “fire” anyone in the federal government associated with “a woke anti-Semitic agenda.” Poilievre also said he would hold the CMHR to the same standards as the federal civil service. “The museum will be there to honour our history and to tell our stories, not to impose toxic woke ideologies against our people.” Now, it’s entirely possible Poilievre was limiting his use of “woke” to the concerns about the anti-Israel backlash that has flared around the world during the war against Hamas. However, Poilievre has increasingly made statements that have alarmed the LGBTTQ+ community and its allies. In a recent interview, Poilievre was asked about U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to issue an executive order declaring America is a country of only two genders, and that they are “unchangeable.” Poilievre said that he was only “aware of two, and as far as I’m concerned, we should have a government that minds its own damn business and leaves people alone.” One could interpret that quote as an assurance Poilievre would not become embroiled in gender identity politics. However, many within the LGBTTQ+ community have already grown concerned that as the public becomes less tolerant about gender identity and sexual orientation, he will roll those issues into his anti-woke campaign. It begs the question: could a Conservative government led by Poilievre lead to the closure of Love in a Dangerous Time ? Poilievre certainly has the motive, and the opportunity: the exhibit is scheduled to run for the next year and if the political calendar unfolds as everyone thinks it will, Poilievre will be prime minister long before the exhibit has run its course. It will be very difficult to anticipate how serious Poilievre is about a purge on woke culture because woke is a term of such vague and constantly evolving meaning. Tired of complaints about systemic racism or gender-based discrimination? Label programs designed to combat both issues as “woke” and then cancel the funding. And if someone objects, tell them you’re anti-woke, not racist or sexist. That is literally the strategy used by some of the superstars of the anti-woke crusade, like academic Jordan Peterson. In an extraordinarily long commentary in the National Post last February, Peterson applauded the woke “counter-offensive” being waged by politicians like Poilievre and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. How did Peterson define woke? Despite spewing thousands of words onto the pages of the Post , he did not offer a definition — which graphically demonstrates the value of the word “woke” to the intolerant. If Poilievre wants to unleash a wholesale anti-woke crusade, he will no doubt benefit from the efforts of Trump, who has made anti-woke official government policy. At the very least, he will be able to see from Trump’s efforts just how far he can push the anti-woke agenda. Right now, Trump is aiming high. In the first three weeks of his new term in office, Trump has issued executive orders to combat woke culture by ending diversity and equity programs and threatening to withdraw federal funding from any school that teaches “critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.” That is a long list of grievances. But in that list is the true power of the word “woke.” It is the all-purpose, easily manipulated and endlessly vague term that can be used to disparage anything or anyone at any time. The CMHR should be applauded for not only documenting love in a dangerous time, but also forging ahead with an exhibit that is running against the grain of populist politics in a dangerous time. One can only hope that it is allowed to run its course.

"Singh joins Poilie vre in calling on Liberals to resume Parliament over U.S. tariff threats, as ministers prepare to meet Trump's border czar",2025.0,"OTTAWA -NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on Thursday called on the Liberals to recall Parliament and work with opposition leaders on a potential support package for workers who could be hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs as early as Feb.1 Singh, who spoke at an event with union leaders in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., said he wanted to be ""really clear"" that his intention to vote non-confidence in the minority Liberals when Parliament resumes at the end of March remains the same. The Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois have also pledged to vote down the government, which points to the likelihood of a spring election. The NDP leader says March 24, which is the date Parliament is set to resume, is two months away. In the meantime, Singh says that if there are ways to fight back against Trump's threat of tariffs and deliver support to affected Canadians, ""let's do it."" ""We need to let these workers know, 'we got your back,' and so I'm calling on Parliament to be recalled so that we can put in place those protections,"" Singh said Thursday ""If there's any legislation required to actually put in place supports for workers, let's get that done."" Gov. Gen. Mary Simon granted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's request to suspend Parliament until March 24, which he did to give the Liberal party room to hold a leadership contest to replace him, after announcing on Jan. 6 he would step down as both party leader and prime minister. The Liberals will name their new leader on March 9. Singh on Thursday pointed out that Opposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also called on Parliament to be recalled, adding: ""Let's call it back and get something done to support these workers."" Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon, who was recently named government house leader, said Ottawa will be ready to act should the U.S. hit Canada with tariffs. ""One thing that you can be very sure about is that Government of Canada is prepared, the Government of Canada will retaliate, the Government of Canada will protect workers throughout this process,"" he said at an unrelated news conference in Gatineau, Que. Trudeau named MacKinnon as government house leader after Karina Gould left the role to campaign in the Liberal leadership race. His office has not yet said whether it has reached out to any opposition leaders. At a campaign stop in Ottawa, Gould said she would ""absolutely"" support reconvening Parliament to deal with the threat of tariffs if the need emerges. ""We have to make decisions based on the needs of the country at the time."" A spokeswoman for former finance minister and deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, another contender in the race, said that ""as a sitting Member of Parliament,"" the Toronto MP is ""ready to work with Parliament and all political parties to fight Donald Trump and to fight for Canada."" A response has not yet been returned from Mark Carney, the perceived front-runner in the race who does not hold a seat. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who is member of Trudeau's cabinet team assigned to Canada-U.S. relations, confirmed the government was looking at how it might be able to support people hit by Trump's potential tariffs through existing programs and resources. Should Parliament need to pass legislation to deliver any additional support and sees opposition parties are willing to work with them, the Liberals would consider recalling Parliament, the minister said, adding he believes those conversations were still premature. The federal Conservatives have not said whether they would support the government in passing any new legislation designed to deliver tariff-related financial support, as the party did when the COVID-19 pandemic first arrived in March 2020. That legislation saw the Liberals send tens of billions over two years to businesses shuttered by lockdowns and individuals who had lost their jobs. Both Singh and Poilievre have said the Liberals must be willing to retaliate should Trump make good on his threat of slapping 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, who is in Washington meeting with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with Trump officials, said she conveyed during a meeting on Wednesday with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that should Trump proceed, Canada would retaliate and ""everything was on the table."" During their meeting, she gifted him a copy of the book, 'The Good Allies,' about the Canada-U.S relationship during the Second World War. In it, she wrote a note that read: ""Marco, an example of what we can achieve when we work together."" On Thursday, she was set to be joined by Public Safety Minister David McGuinty who is trying to sell Trump officials on Canada's new plan to beef up border security, including by targeting the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl. Immigration Minister Marc Miller was also travelling to join him. On Friday, the trio of ministers were set to meet with Trump's border czar, Tom Homan. To showcase its efforts, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc also texted a three-minute video of the Canada-U.S. boundary to Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Commerce Department, It came after Lutnick said during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday mthat the Feb. 1 threat of tariffs is directly tied to concerns about fentanyl and immigration, saying the countries could avoid them if the U.S sees them taking action. ""As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff. And if they don't, then there will be,"" Lutnick said. MacKinnon said on Thursday that Canada was doing everything it could to avoid tariffs and that ministers were meeting with every official possible. Knowing how much of Trump's concerns lies with its northern border is also ""part of the problem,"" he said. ""Understanding what the motivation for tariffs might be is something that the government is trying to better understand.""

With all due respect to Janet Gasparini, my apologies for pouring a little bit of rain on her parade. I would refer her to the non-partisan website, 338 CANADA, to educate herself on all of the latest polls across the country showing party standings - nationally and riding by riding across the whole country. For starters, let's do away with her litany of falsehoods and misinformation: the most liked federal leader of the mainstream federal political parties today is - by a long shot - Conservative Pierre Poilievre, and dead last - our now dearly depart - ed, Justin Trudeau. According to 338 CANADA, Pierre Poilievre's conservatives have a 99 per cent chance of forming the next federal government - The Liberals, less than 1 per cent. Regionally, in the Sudbury riding, the PCs are polling 40 per cent, the NDP at 31 per cent and the Liberals at 22 per cent for third place. In the Nickel Belt riding, PCs are in first place with the Liberals again at the bottom at 20 per cent. So please, I would suggest Ms. Gasparini return to reality and seek the truth.

Poilievre rejects classified guidance on foreign meddling:   Conservative Leader says CSIS is free to brief caucus members directly if the top spy agency feels it’s warranted,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has for months refused to apply for a topsecret clearance to receive confidential briefings, has now rejected a CSIS offer of classified guidance on foreign interference. He said the Canadian Security Intelligence Service is free to brief any MP or senator in the Conservative caucus directly if the agency feels it’s warranted. This is the latest development in a tussle between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mr. Poilievre that began last June after the release of a report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which said some parliamentarians are collaborating with foreign governments such as China and India to advance their own interests. NSICOP also alleged Beijing and New Delhi interfered in Conservative leadership races. Mr. Poilievre has refused to apply for the security clearance necessary to read the unredacted report. He said the obligations of a clearance would restrict his ability to discuss and hold the government to account. In October, Mr. Trudeau, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Poilievre for refusing the clearance, said he would ask security services to find another way to brief his rival on foreign interference targeting the Conservatives. In December, Mr. Poilievre’s office announced he had agreed to receive a briefing on national-security matters from CSIS – without a special clearance. A “threat reduction measures” (TRM) briefing can be given to an individual “regardless of security clearance status,” the Conservatives said. But the Conservative Leader’s office said it was subsequently informed that even this CSIS briefing would come with restrictions on his ability to talk about or take action on what he had learned. “Under the terms of the briefing proposed, Mr. Poilievre would obtain information about foreign interference directed at a parliamentarian. But he would then be unable to speak with the parliamentarian about the briefing received unless the government provided consent to do so,” said Sebastian Skamski, the director of media relations for Mr. Poilievre’s office, in a statement. Mr. Skamski said the Conservatives consider these restrictions unacceptable and “entirely contrary to the government’s supposed objective of enabling the person briefed to reduce risk.” The Conservatives say they have been told the information CSIS intended to discuss with Mr. Poilievre was not about matters that would require the removal of individuals from the Conservative caucus or from the list of nominated party candidates but rather about the risks that some in the party may be targeted by foreign interference. The Conservatives noted that CSIS has already briefed MPs directly to warn them about risks. “Should any parliamentarian have foreign interference directed at them, the government could and should use TRMs to notify that parliamentarian directly of the specific threat. This has been done in the past such as in the cases of MPs Michael Chong and Jenny Kwan,” Mr. Skamski said, referring to the Conservative foreign affairs critic and the NDP’s immigration critic. In October, the Prime Minister appeared before a public inquiry to answer questions about his record in fighting foreign interference. During testimony, Mr. Trudeau redirected the focus to the Official Opposition and announced he had been given the names of past and present Conservative parliamentarians and candidates linked to foreign interference. He criticized Mr. Poilievre for not applying for clearance. Near the end of that month, Mr. Trudeau alleged that Mr. Poilievre’s refusal to obtain a security clearance was a dereliction of duty. In the final report of the public inquiry into foreign interference, released Tuesday, Justice Marie-Josée Hogue, the commissioner, played down the NSICOP report’s talk of collaborators. “Although a few cases involving things like attempts to curry favour with parliamentarians have come to light, the phenomenon remains marginal and largely ineffective,” she said. “While the states’ attempts are troubling and there is some concerning conduct by parliamentarians, there is no cause for widespread alarm.” But Justice Hogue urged all federal party leaders to obtain national-security clearances so they can view top-secret intelligence that may affect members of their parties. “I heard that it poses a challenge for the government if a party leader does not have a security clearance,” she said, noting the Prime Minister’s testimony in October. He told the inquiry he was informed about “explosive” intelligence about Conservative Party members involving “significant foreign interference.” Justice Hogue shed no further light on these allegations in her final report.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Chase, Steven; Fife, Robert",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 30, 2025",Conservatism; Public inquiries; Prime ministers; Security clearances; Political leadership,,2025-01-30,The Globe and Mail
'Coolest moment': Why Calgary's Cleeve Harper is on Canada's Davis Cup tennis team,2025.0,"Cleeve Harper hopes his is a match made in tennis heaven. Or at least, the Calgarian hopes any appearance he makes in Montreal this weekend is enough to help Canada move on in Davis Cup competition. The 24-year-old Harper - a tournament winner mere hours ago on the ATP Challenger Tour - received a first-ver call to arms earlier this week by Team Canada captain Frank Dancevic to replace injured star Denis Shapovalov in the high-profile international event. ""Super excited to be here and looking forward to the week ahead,"" said Harper, from Montreal, on the eve of what he hopes is his debut for Canada when it hosts Hungary in cup qualifying action. ""I don't know for sure yet if I'll be playing - that's probably more of a game-time decision,"" continued Harper, who trains - when he's in his home-town - out of Calgary's Osten & Victor Alberta Tennis Centre. ""The first practices were really good - it was nice to get out there and work with the guys and the coaches - and I'm just extremely happy to be here and be part of the team. ""If I get to play and help out the team, obviously that would be great. And if not, it's great to be here and support them, as well."" WHAT IS THE DAVIS CUP? The Davis Cup consists of the sport's top men competing for their nation in a quest to become the best tennis country on the planet. The International Tennis Federation tournament, which is now the world's largest annual international team competition in sport - with a record 157 nations involved in last year's event - pits countries against one another over four weekends of the calendar. The 18 best national teams are assigned to the World Group and compete annually for the Davis Cup. Each elimination round between competing nations is held in one of the countries and is played as best-of-five matches, consisting of four singles and one doubles. This year's edition continues in the coming days with the Qualifiers 1st Round, with the teams representing the 14 nations that competed in the 2024 finals plus the 12 World Group I winners from '24. Canada is one of those Group 1 winners, making it to the final eight last year, and was named a host country for this weekend's Qualifiers 1st Round, with Hungary in Montreal to play the third-seed Canadian team. The tie between Hungary and Canada takes place this weekend at Montreal's IGA Stadium ... . Saturday: Two singles matches @ 12:45 p.m. ET . Sunday: A doubles match @ 11 a.m. ET, followed by at least one singles match. If necessary, a second singles match will determine the final outcome. From there, winners advance to the Qualifiers 2nd round in September. The 2025 eight-team finals are set for Nov. 18-23 in Bologna, Italy, with the Italians hosting as the reigning Davis Cup champions. WHY HARPER IS IN THE MIX? With veteran Shapovalov sidelined by a back injury, Canada needed another player for the team, which also consists of B.C.'s Vasek Pospisil. Ontario's Liam Draxl and Quebeckers Gabriel Diallo and Alexis Galarneau. And Harper fits the bill, given his quick rise to success since graduating last April from the University of Texas, with whom he was an NCAA doubles champion. He's primarily competed on the ATP Challenger circuit, notably winning the doubles title at the Oeiras Open 3 alongside Draxl last weekend in Portugal. ""It'd be super cool to play doubles in the Davis Cup, especially alongside Liam,"" Harper said. ""We've been doing quite well on the tour, and we've played a lot together. We bring a lot of energy out there on the court, especially in team matches. If we are given that opportunity, I think we'll do well for the team and, hopefully, get a point on the board for Canada."" Over his career, Harper has racked up eight ITF doubles titles, including six during the 2024 season. ""I was just trying to take it one step at a time,"" Harper said. ""I started with the ITF Futures and worked my way out of those. And then it was onto the Challenger level. ""I kinda figured maybe at one point - I didn't know if it would be this year - I'd hopefully get the call up to play for Team Canada and join them. It's obviously super cool to have gotten it this year and get this experience for when I play at bigger other events on the ATP Tour."" With his win in the Portugal over the weekend, Harper moved up to now be ranked 126th on the ATP's doubles board. Climbing further up that ladder shouldn't be a problem, either, since he's always put in the effort to make his way upward wherever he's taken his game. ""I've put a lot of hard work and dedication into my tennis,"" Harper said. ""I was never one of the most talented or best players growing up throughout juniors. ""And I was never one of the best recruits coming into college, either. But I got some good opportunities from my coaches to help me get to UT. Even when was first there, I was one of the worst players on the team to start. But I kinda worked my way up through hard work and just being dedicated to it and loving the sport. ""I've got to keep working to - hopefully - move onto the next level, too."" His time at the Davis Cup, no matter if he plays or not, should help his future. ""We're obviously disappointed that Denis can't join us this week,"" Dancevic said. ""He's an exceptionally talented player who has always taken great pride in representing Canada ... That said, we still have a strong squad that can compete with anyone. We believe in our players and are thrilled to welcome Cleeve, who adds depth to our team."" Harper, who's made a few appearances at the ATC-hosted Calgary Challenger is more than happy to take up the challenge. ""It's really fun to be back in the team aspect of things,"" added Harper, who followed coaches in his career from Calgary's Rico Tennis Academy to South Carolina's Smith Stearns Tennis Academy and onward to the University of Texas. ""My college tennis years, probably my favourite thing I'd done while playing tennis was being a part of team matches and getting to play beside all your best friends. ""And the Davis Cup is probably one of the coolest moments you can get in tennis or just in sport, in general. Playing for your country and just being part of a team for your country is really cool."" tsaelhof@postmedia.com( tsaelhof@postmedia.com ) http://www.x.com/ToddSaelhofPM",Calgary Herald (Online); Calgary,Calgary,"Saelhof, Todd",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 29, 2025",Tennis; Teams,Nom: University of Texas; NAICS: 611310,2025-01-29,Calgary Herald

To get an early version sent directly to your inbox, sign up here TOP STORY As radical anti-Israel rallies continue to be a feature of Canadian downtowns even in the wake of a Gazan ceasefire, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre proposed on Monday to begin deporting non-citizens participating in hate activities. ""We see on our own streets antisemitism guided by obscene woke ideologies that have led to an explosion in hate crimes,"" Poilievre said in a brief address at the official Holocaust Memorial Day ceremony in Ottawa. He then added, ""we must not just condemn these things, we must take action against them."" ""We must deport from our country any temporary resident that is here on a permit or a visa that is carrying out violence or hate crimes on our soil."" Ever since the October 7 Hamas-led terrorist attacks against Israel, Canada has been hit by hundreds of anti-Israel rallies, blockades, and other actions - many of them organized by a handful of openly anti-Zionist groups including Toronto4Palestine, the Palestinian Youth Movement, and student groups such as McGill University's Students for Palestine's Honour and Resistance. Some of the rallies were initially celebratory, but they quickly shifted to calls for ""ceasefire,"" often with the claim that Israel was committing genocide. Now that a Gazan ceasefire has been in place since Jan. 19, rallies have continued unabated, often with calls for Palestinian ""resistance"" to continue until Israel's complete destruction. ""The fight isn't over. In fact, it has just begun,"" Toronto4Palestine said in a statement released in the wake of a ceasefire announcement. In a social media post on Monday, Poilievre said Canada was ""in a dark time of rampant antisemitism."" A Monday statement issued by the Conservative Party also vowed ""to restore a Canada where Jews are able to live fearlessly and unapologetically Jewish lives."" On Saturday, Toronto-based lawyer and protest watcher Caryma Sa'd posted video of one of her videographers being spit on by a woman in a keffiyeh and declaring, ""F-king Zionist little pig."" ""He has never taken any public position on Israel or Jewish nationalism, and this woman is a stranger,"" Sa'd wrote in a caption. The alleged assault occurred outside the context of an anti-Israel rally. But on Tuesday, Toronto4Palestine advertised a ""Ceasefire Today, Liberation Tomorrow"" event in Mississauga, where attendees were invited to ""strategize for the future of our liberation struggle in the far diaspora."" In the final hours of a ceasefire deal being finalized, on Jan. 16 Toronto4Palestine also organized a ""Gaza Will Rise"" event outside Toronto's Israeli consulate, which the group refers to as the ""Zionist consulate."" Attendees were urged to ""drive the struggle for liberation forward."" The Montreal chapter of Palestinian Youth Movement marked the ceasefire with a ""victory"" rally through the city's downtown behind a banner reading, ""Ceasefire Today. Liberation Tomorrow."" Video from a Montreal rally posted by the X account FactsMatter showed jubilant crowds blocking intersections, chanting in Arabic and lighting off smoke bombs, all under the gaze of police observers on bicycles. Montreal, Canada Despite a ceasefire being in place on January 19, demonstrations continue on Canadian streets - with covered faces, military fatigues and smoke bombs.

The event name is a call for Israel's annihilation; Gaza and Jenin being on western and eastern sides of the country, respectively. The X account Leviathan posted translated video of a Jan. 18 rally in Toronto where a speaker allegedly chanted in Arabic, ""We don't want to talk to Israel except with guns.""

""Toronto and Canada must be governed by rule of law. Not mob rule."" Multiculturalism is a bad fit for Quebec, immigration minister says Trudeau's EV subsidy racket is unravelling before his eyes IN OTHER NEWS The Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference released its final report today, and the main takeaway is that there are no ""traitors"" in the House of Commons as has been alleged. Treason is a very high bar in Canada: You have to cooperate in an armed insurrection against the Government of Canada, or you have to collaborate with an enemy at a time of war. So, the report does leave open the possibility that MPs had electoral assistance from foreign governments, or knowingly collaborated with foreign consulates. Nevertheless, Commissioner Marie-Josée Hogue stressed that whatever foreign interference there's been, Canadians should be careful not to have it ""overblown."" ""Although there are a very small number of isolated cases where foreign interference may have had some impact on the outcome of a nomination contest or the result of an election in a given riding, there is no evidence to suggest that our institutions have been seriously affected by such interference or that parliamentarians owe their successful election to foreign entities."" Last week, we covered the saga of Zain Haq, the serial road blockader who was asking for an intervention by the Trudeau government to save him from deportation. That never came, and he's back in Pakistan now. The NDP's Charlie Angus has called on Elections Canada to investigate billionaire and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk as a potential agent of foreign interference. In a letter to the elections agency, Angus said Musk ""serves as a pathway for Russian misinformation and the rise of hate and threats in Canada"" and ""could easily impact our electoral integrity."" There's just one problem: Musk has Canadian citizenship via his mother, Maye. So Angus effectively seems to be asking Elections Canada to investigate a Canadian for having opinions about an election. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh appears to be walking back his pledge to immediately bring down the Trudeau government at the next available opportunity. Singh has said several times that no matter what the outcome of the Liberal leadership race, he'd be pushing for a non-confidence motion as soon as the House of Commons reconvenes in late March. But this week, he said he might keep them in power if they tabled a bill filled with monetary supports offered to counter Trump tariffs. ""I will be voting against the government at the earliest opportunity. If the Liberals are serious, though, about a plan to support workers, call the opposition leaders together. Discuss that plan with us,"" he said at a press availability Get all of these insights and more into your inbox by signing up for the First Reading newsletter here",National Post (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Hopper, Tristin",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 29, 2025",Hate crimes; Diplomatic & consular services; Social networks; Antisemitism; Jewish people; Leadership; Zionism; Gun violence; Demonstrations & protests; Elections; Truces & cease fires,Nom: Elections Canada; NAICS: 921190; Nom: Hamas; NAICS: 813940,2025-01-29,National Post
Michael Higgins: A Senate stuffed with Liberal bagmen is Trudeau's gift to Poilievre,2025.0,"The problem with politicians is that they will insist on indulging in partisan politicking, the distasteful and grubby manipulation of affairs to advance their own, or party, fortunes. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the electorate who can see it for what it is - an odious form of political nepotism. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has always been politically rapacious, to the benefit of himself, his party and his friends. One might sigh, plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose, but Trudeau pledged to do politics differently. Turns out he's not so different after all. Are we surprised? CBC reported this week that Trudeau, before he leaves office on March 9, wants to fill the 10 vacant positions in the Senate. During his time in office, Trudeau has appointed 90 of the 105-seat chamber. (During his nine years in office, Stephen Harper appointed 59 senators.) Stacking the Senate with partisan appointments is one way Trudeau can leave a legacy of pain for the Conservatives. An upper chamber hostile to a Conservative government has the means to be a large legislative thorn in its side. And indeed, Trudeau will leave behind him a Senate steeped in Liberal partisanship and patronage - the very evils he promised to end eleven years ago. In January 2014, Trudeau issued a statement declaring: ""Major Announcement: Ending partisanship and patronage in the Senate."" ""The Senate is broken, and needs to be fixed,"" he said. Trudeau said partisanship meant senators were focused on what was good for their party and not the country. ""Under Mr. Harper we have seen it at its worst - it amplifies the Prime Minister's power."" He said he would end patronage so that the Senate was not ""run like the prime minister's private club."" Trudeau said Harper and the Conservatives could no longer tell the difference between party interest and public interest. ""That's poor judgment. More than that, it's just plain wrong,"" said Trudeau. To reform the Senate, Trudeau created an Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments. Senators appointed by the prime minister would sit as independents and not as Liberals. And yet despite these apparent reforms the Senate still appears to be the prime minister's private club as an examination of Trudeau's appointments show. There may well be 90 independent senators in the chamber of ""sober second thought"" but it is astonishing how many are affiliated with the Liberals. In his 2014 statement, Trudeau pledged that with regard to Senate appointments there would be ""no more announcements the week before Christmas, under the cover of darkness."" Last year, on December 19, the week before Christmas and two days before the darkest night of the year, Trudeau announced his latest Senate appointments. The new senators were Allister Surette (a former Liberal politician) and Nancy Karetak-Lindell (a former Liberal MP). In August 2024, Trudeau appointed two other senators, one being Daryl Fridhandler, a regular donor to the Liberals and a former fundraiser and political organizer for the party. So much for independence. Last year, Radio-Canada analyzed Trudeau's Senate appointments over the previous year and found 66 per cent had either donated money to the Liberals or had worked for the party. They included Victor Boudreau, a longtime Liberal, Rodger Cuzner, a former Cape Breton MP and John McNair, a former provincial Liberal chief of staff. Despite the advisory board being ""independent"" and Trudeau's picks sitting as ""independents"", the Senate has a remarkably heavy Liberal bias. Conservative senator Claude Carignan told the CBC, ""For someone who advocated an independent Senate, (Trudeau) will have ended up filling the Senate with a large majority of Liberals or people who support his policies."" But if the process to select senators really is independent then why the prime minister's sudden rush to fill the 10 vacancies before he quits? Could it be that Trudeau is determined to pack more partisan Liberals into the second chamber? Constitutionally, Trudeau may have announced his resignation but he is still prime minister with all the powers that the position entails. He would claim that it is within his rights to appoint the senators. But legitimately, Trudeau is a lame-duck prime minister and the Liberals a moribund party that may be weeks away from being kicked out of government. This is not a case of business as usual. The prorogation of Parliament has stopped business in the House and the Senate. If Parliament had not been prorogued, then Trudeau was facing a House where all the major opposition parties had promised to vote non confidence in the government and bring it down. Meanwhile, many cabinet ministers who should be focused on the threat of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump are out on the campaign trail for Liberal leadership contenders. Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister and Karina Gould, the Liberal House Leader, are spending their energies fighting for that top spot. A Canadian government right now should be laser focused on fighting off an aggressive Trump who threatens to ignite a trade war as well as ensuring our democracy is protected from the ""existential"" threat from foreign actors who, according to Justice Marie-Josée Hogue's final report on foreign interference, seek to undermine it. But no, the prime minister will spend his final lame-duck days packing the Senate with his acolytes, leaving us with, to use Trudeau's words from 2014, ""a hyper-political, hyper-partisan Senate that is, more than ever, the prime minister's private plaything.""

Poilievre rebuffs calls to obtain national-security clearance to view top-secret information on foreign meddling:   Conservative Leader says obligations of seeing top-secret documents would restrict his ability to discuss and hold the government to account on what he had learned,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has for months refused to apply for a top-secret clearance to receive confidential briefings, has now rejected a proposal by CSIS to offer him classified guidance on foreign interference. He said the Canadian Security Intelligence Service is free to brief any of the MPs or senators in the Conservative caucus directly if they feel it’s warranted. This is the latest development in a tussle between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mr. Poilievre that began last June after the release of a report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which said some parliamentarians are collaborating with foreign governments such as China and India to advance their own interests. NSICOP also said Beijing and New Delhi allegedly interfered in Conservative leadership races. Mr. Poilievre has refused to apply for the security clearance necessary to read the unredacted report. He said the obligations of this clearance would restrict his ability to discuss and hold the government to account on what he had learned. In October, Mr. Trudeau, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Poilievre for refusing top-level security clearance, announced he would ask security services to find another way to brief his rival on foreign interference targeting the Conservatives. In December, Mr. Poilievre’s office announced he had agreed to receive a briefing on national-security matters from CSIS, though without being required to obtain special clearance that he has said would constrain his ability to publicly hold the government to account. This would be a ""Threat Reduction Measures"" (TRM) briefing that can be given to an individual ""regardless of security clearance status,"" the Conservatives said. But the Conservative Leader’s office said it was subsequently informed even this CSIS briefing would come with restrictions on Mr. Poilievre’s ability to talk or take action on what he had learned. ""In subsequent discussions with the government regarding the offered TRM briefing, officials indicated that should Mr. Poilievre receive the TRM briefing, he would be legally prevented from speaking with anyone other than legal counsel about the briefing and would be able to take action only as expressly authorized by the Government, rendering him unable to effectively use any relevant information he received,"" Sebastian Skamski, director of media relations for Mr. Poilievre’s office, said in a statement. ""Under the terms of the briefing proposed, Mr. Poilievre would obtain information about foreign interference directed at a Parliamentarian. But he would then be unable to speak with the Parliamentarian about the briefing received unless the government provided consent to do so."" Mr. Skamski said the Conservatives consider these restrictions unacceptable and ""entirely contrary to the government’s supposed objective of enabling the person briefed to reduce risk."" The Conservatives say they have been told the information CSIS intended to discuss with Mr. Poilievre was not about matters that would require the removal of individuals from the Conservative caucus or from the list of nominated party candidates but about the risks that some in the party may be targeted by foreign interference. ""In exchanges between representatives of the Leader of the Opposition and the government, the government advised that the intended briefing did not implicate the suitability of any current Parliamentarian to remain in caucus, nor did the intended briefing touch on any individual nominated as a candidate for the Party or seeking to be nominated,"" Mr. Skamski said. ""Government officials advised that their proposed briefing concerns foreign interference ""directed at"" Parliamentarians. The Conservatives noted CSIS have already briefed MPs directly to warn them about risks. ""Should any Parliamentarian have foreign interference directed at them, the government could and should use TRMs to notify that Parliamentarian directly of the specific threat. This has been done in the past such as in the cases of MPs Michael Chong and Jenny Kwan,"" Mr. Skamski said, referring to the Conservative foreign affairs critic and the NDP’s immigration critic."" Under the terms of the briefing proposed, Mr. Poilievre would obtain information about foreign interference directed at a Parliamentarian. But he would then be unable to speak with the Parliamentarian about the briefing received unless the Government provided consent to do so. In October, the Prime Minister appeared before a public inquiry to answer questions about his record in fighting foreign interference. During testimony, Mr. Trudeau redirected the focus to the Official Opposition, and announced he had been given the names of past and present Conservative parliamentarians and candidates who are linked to foreign interference. He criticized Mr. Poilievre for not applying for clearance. Near the end of that month, Mr. Trudeau alleged that Mr. Poilievre’s refusal to obtain a security clearance was a dereliction of his duty. In the final report into foreign interference released Tuesday, Justice Marie-Josée Hogue, the commissioner, played down the NSICOP report’s talk of collaborators. ""Although a few cases involving things like attempts to curry favour with parliamentarians have come to light, the phenomenon remains marginal and largely ineffective,"" she said. ""While the states’ attempts are troubling and there is some concerning conduct by parliamentarians, there is no cause for widespread alarm."" But Justice Hogue urged all federal party leaders to obtain national-security clearances so they can view top secret intelligence that may impact members of their parties. ""I heard that it poses a challenge for the government if a party leader does not have a security clearance,"" she said, noting the Prime Minister testimony in October. He told the inquiry he was informed about ""explosive"" intelligence about Conservative Party members involving ""significant foreign interference.""

No further security briefings for Poilievre:   Move comes as foreign interference report is released,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will no longer receive a briefing from Canada's top spy agency because the special pathway through which he was approved to receive the information would still bar him from openly sharing the intelligence. In early December, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had determined that it could share classified information with the Conservative leader through what's known as a ""threat reduction measure,"" or a TRM. Such a measure can be used in cases where it is deemed appropriate to share classified intelligence with someone who does not possess the necessary security clearances. TRMs are aimed at reducing threats to Canada's security instead of collecting more intelligence to investigate the matter. Disclosing certain information to individuals who have not undergone the required screenings is one of the ways that can be accomplished, because they can take actions that would minimize the threat. Unlike other federal party leaders, Poilievre has resisted obtaining his security clearance because he refuses to be ""gagged"" by the information he receives. He has argued that being bound to secrecy, which is required at that level of clearance, would prevent him from discussing his findings with his caucus - and Canadians. He has long demanded that he receive the intelligence anyway through the TRM pathway, believing that would allow him to receive critical information that could be publicly shared. But that assumption did not last long. ""In subsequent discussions with the government regarding the offered TRM briefing, officials indicated that should Mr. Poilievre receive the TRM briefing, he would be legally prevented from speaking with anyone other than legal counsel about the briefing and would be able to take action only as expressly authorized by the government, rendering him unable to effectively use any relevant information he received,"" Poilievre's spokesperson, Sebastian Skamski, told the Star in a statement. ""This is clearly unacceptable, and entirely contrary to the government's supposed objective of enabling the person briefed to reduce risk."" Poilievre's office did not respond to further questions about which officials relayed that information to the Conservative leader, nor when he was told. The update comes as Justice Marie-Josée Hogue on Tuesday released her long-awaited final report on foreign interference in Canadian affairs, following more than a year of consultations and hearings that featured hours of testimony ranging from affected diaspora communities in Canada to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Among the 51 recommendations Hogue issued in the report, the Quebec judge noted that the leaders of all federal political parties represented in the House of Commons ""should be encouraged and given the opportunity to obtain top secret security clearances as soon as possible after they become leaders."" She wrote earlier in her report that party leaders have ""unique powers and responsibilities"" to act on foreign meddling threats, such as by removing an MP from certain roles or not promoting them in the first place. Hogue noted, however, that there are ""challenges for party leaders who receive intelligence, particularly if they are told that, due to secrecy concerns, there are limits"" to how they use the information. The NDP's Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet and the Green Party's Elizabeth May have each undergone the necessary screenings, while the prime minister typically automatically receives intelligence briefings.

"Ontario Liberals, labour groups criticize Ford over snap election call and misusing public funds:   The Premier, whose Progressive Conservative Party is already leading in the polls, has said he would campaign while continuing to conduct government business",2025.0,"The Ontario Liberal Party is warning about Premier Doug Ford’s potential misuse of public funds during the early election campaign he is set to trigger this week, saying his planned government-funded engagements to respond to potential U.S. tariffs could inappropriately reap political benefits. Labour groups, meanwhile, say the election call will distract from Ontario’s efforts to address U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened 25-per-cent tariffs, which could begin as early as Saturday. Mr. Ford confirmed last week that he will launch a snap election campaign on Wednesday, with voters expected to head to the polls on Feb. 27. The next election date under provincial legislation is June, 2026. The Premier, whose Progressive Conservative Party is already leading in the polls, has said he would campaign while continuing to conduct government business. That includes by travelling twice to Washington in February to lobby American lawmakers, and by continuing to serve as the head of the Council of the Federation (COF), representing the country’s provincial premiers in addressing U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat of tariffs. But Liberal MPP John Fraser, in a Friday letter sent to Ontario’s Secretary of Cabinet, the chief electoral officer and the integrity commissioner, said using public funds toward such engagements would violate the conventions of the “caretaker government,” which is formed ad hoc to perform some functions while elections are under way. During the caretaker period, elected officials are prohibited from using public funds for continuing political work or public engagement. Mr. Fraser said his Washington trips and COF participation would be inappropriate, as they could be “raised as a political issue during the election” and “in the context of an early election, this work would be explicitly partisan in nature.” The PC Party did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Another source of criticism of Mr. Ford ahead of his planned early election is the Ontario Federation of Labour, which represents 54 unions and one million workers in Ontario. It is leading the call for the Ford government to establish a tariff task force and create a unified strategy to address the economic threat facing the province, rather than send voters to the polls. “Doug Ford’s decision to shut down the legislature – destabilizing the province in favour of heading to the polls for his own political gain – is opportunistic, reckless, and irresponsible,” said Laura Walton, president of the OFL, in a press release Monday. Mr. Ford has argued that he needs a “strong mandate” to implement an aid package with “tens of billions” of dollars in spending to support workers and businesses affected by potential U.S. tariffs, which he has said could cost Ontario up to 500,000 jobs. Ms. Walton was joined by other labour leaders in condemning the Premier’s election decision. JP Hornick, president of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, said it was not a “bold move” to confront Mr. Trump’s threats but instead “a decision to do nothing for a month.” Fred Hahn, president of CUPE Ontario, accused the Premier of “trying to distract us from his record of failure as Premier.” And Erin Ariss, provincial president of the Ontario Nurses’ Association, said continuing issues such as the shortage of nurses were being overlooked in favour of political manoeuvring. Their statements lacked specifics on actionable solutions aside from creating a co-ordinated policy and pointing to examples of other provinces that have already brought together tariff roundtables.

Poilievre has his dream opponents,2025.0,"As the federal Liberal leadership race takes shape, it's looking increasingly like a two-way race between Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney. With the Liberals lagging significantly in the polls, the party is clearly looking for a saviour. But with a shared elite pedigree and apparent inability to defend anything resembling a coherent progressive vision, both Freeland and Carney are uniquely ill-suited for these populist times. Economic inequality is at a record high and home ownership is increasingly out of reach for most young Canadians. The public is searching for both answers and help. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has identified a culprit - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals, whom he portrays as the embodiment of ""globalist Davos elites,"" referring to the World Economic Forum (WEF). Echoing far-right conspiracy theories, Poilievre insists these elites harbour a ""socialist agenda"" that they seek to implement through a post-COVID ""Great Reset."" Whether Poilievre actually believes this or not, espousing these views hasn't hurt him at all in the polls, which he's consistently been leading by double digits for the past two years. Poilievre's assertion is, to be absolutely clear, nonsense. There is a global economic elite and their influence is pernicious. But the notion that a capitalist elite seek to overthrow the very capitalist system they benefit from is preposterous. The Great Reset is a real WEF initiative, which seeks to rebrand the inequities of global capitalism by creating, in the words of Canadian author and journalist Naomi Klein, ""a plausible impression that the huge winners in this system are on the verge of voluntarily setting greed aside to get serious about solving the raging crises that are radically destabilizing our world."" But, once firmly cemented in the public consciousness, political narratives matter. Poilievre couldn't have conjured a better embodiment of the global elite he disingenuously rails against than Freeland, the former deputy prime minister and finance minister, or Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. In her 2012 book ""Plutocrats,"" Freeland wrote about the ""new global rich"" with an insider's lens, often praising the ultra-wealthy she chronicled. Freeland did, however, acknowledge the problems posed by excessive economic inequality, proposing technocratic tax tinkering as a solution, which was essentially the path she and Trudeau pursued. But Freeland now hints that she will abandon the capital gains tax increase she staunchly defended from Poilievre's attacks last year if she becomes prime minister. Carney, Freeland's long-time friend and a godfather to one of her children, is described in ""Plutocrats"" as a ""protagonist in a central battle between the plutocracy and the rest of us."" It's a view even more unbelievable now than it was then. A self-described ""huge believer in markets,"" Carney used his Jan. 16 campaign kickoff as an opportunity to distance himself from ""the far left."" ""We can't redistribute what we don't have, and we can't support the vulnerable in our society or defend this great country if we have a weak economy,"" Carney said, reworking Conservative ex-Alberta premier Jason Kenney's neo-liberal mantra ""that in order to be a compassionate and generous society, you must be a prosperous one first."" While it's unlikely either Freeland or Carney can reverse the Liberals' long-sagging electoral fortunes, the positions they take will help shape the range of political possibilities going into the next election, which are looking increasingly narrow. Fleeing Poilievre's churlish taunts of ""Carbon Tax Carney"" and ""Carbon Tax Chrystia,"" both are expected to reverse the carbon tax, Trudeau's signature, albeit flawed climate policy. A market-based solution that as recently as 2014 had the endorsement of no less a Conservative luminary than Preston Manning as an alternative to directly regulating carbon emissions, taxing carbon is now seen as a bridge too far. Meanwhile, neither candidate appears interested in pursuing Trudeau's unfulfilled promise to get the federal government back in the housing business, which would play a much greater role in addressing legitimate cost of living concerns than another tax cut. With Freeland and Carney engaged in a battle of elites, it's hard not to conclude that Pierre Poilievre will likely emerge as the ultimate winner of the Liberal leadership race.

"Trump, Ford put stumbling blocks in Poilievre's path to power",2025.0,"It's starting to become clear why Pierre Poilievre was so keen to have an election last fall. Not only is Donald Trump raining on the Conservative leader's parade, but now Premier Doug Ford will be beating Poilievre to the campaign trail with the Feb. 27 Ontario election to be called within days. Poilievre is going to be hoping that Ontarians are in such an anti- Liberal mood that they will be happy to vote conservative twice this year. A federal election campaign is widely expected to be launched not long after Parliament resumes at the end of March. Ford has long signalled that he wanted a provincial election before that federal vote - and Poilievre is one of the reasons, my Queen's Park colleagues have reported. Back last June, when the Star first reported that a 2025 election was on the horizon for Ontario, the reasons cited included the damage that the federal Conservatives could do to Ford and their provincial counterparts. Ford and his team were worried that a Poilievre victory would usher in slashed spending, reduced transfer payments to the provinces and a scrapping of the electric vehicle strategy that Ford has been aggressively pursuing in concert with Justin Trudeau and his Liberals. Trump is wreaking chaos on that last score with his own rollback of electric vehicle incentives in the U.S., but the more Ontarians absorb what that's doing to the huge auto industry in the province, the less they may like a federal Conservative leader headed down the same path. There isn't a strict overlap between federal Conservatives and Ontario's Progressive Conservatives. Indeed, many of the same people who have voted for Ford have also voted for Trudeau's Liberals. The lines get a little more direct when it comes to volunteers and resources. Enthusiastic partisans, willing to sacrifice time and energy for a political cause, are precious to all political parties. Ford will be tapping into the same network that Poilievre is hoping to mobilize whenever Canadians do go to the polls. Maybe it will be good practice for the conservative troops on the ground in Ontario. They'll get a chance to see what's working - and what isn't - at the doorstep. The same will be true, too, for Ontario Liberals and New Democrats, whose supporters and resources also are shared with their federal counterparts. Ford has been asked - as recently as last week, again - whether he's trying to get around this quirk of the federation, in which Ontarians seem to be content with having one party in power federally and the opposite provincially. That phenomenon, known as the ""Underhill balance theory,"" has been the reality for 70 of the past 81 years. The premier says that's not it; he's just looking for a mandate to take on Trump. Trump, though, is another problem for Poilievre. It's early, but a new poll from Ekos suggests the Liberals here in Canada may be benefiting from what is happening south of the border. In what Ekos is calling a ""dramatic recovery,"" its latest polling shows the Liberals back in the realm of 30 per cent popularity, for the first time since 2022. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto has also been thinking that Poilievre may have a Trump problem. The U.S. president is not gaining any friends in Canada with all his belligerent talk and threats toward this country, but any Conservative leader here has to tread a fine line. ""He cannot appear too accommodating of Trump's threats, lest he alienate voters who view Trump as a destabilizing force, yet he cannot seem overly belligerent toward the new administration, given the need to safeguard cross-border economic ties and satisfy a sizable portion of his own base who likes Trump,"" Coletto wrote. The more that Trump dominates, even frames, the next federal election debate only highlights this conundrum for Poilievre. Meanwhile, the two campaigns that Poilievre intended to wage last fall, against the ""carbon tax"" and Justin Trudeau, are fizzling. The two leading contenders for the Liberal leadership, Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney, have already said they are backing off on the consumer price on carbon. Even Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, who is endorsing Carney, said he was forced to admit that policy is dead. So much for the ""carbon tax election"" - a phrase that was uttered more than 800 times in the Commons last year alone, according to the OpenParliament.ca website. The anti-Trudeau campaign now lacks a villain, given Trudeau's looming resignation. In politics, a week is a long time. By the time Poilievre goes to the polls, Trudeau will have been gone for many weeks. Poilievre was definitely in majority territory if an election had been held last fall. Thanks to Trump, Trudeau and not least of all Ford, the fates of 2025 don't seem to be aligning on the Conservative leader's side.

"NP View: The federal public service needs downsizing, and Poilievre's the man to do it",2025.0,"Like an untended lawn that's become encased in unpleasant brush, the Canadian public service is overgrown. It needs a lot more than a couple of passes with a lawnmower - it needs a chainsaw, and only Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has the guts to wield it. On Wednesday, the Tories set out clear benchmarks for the public service cleanup. The plan is to not replace employees when they leave, the party's deputy leader, Melissa Lantsman, told the National Post. Given that around 17,000 staff members end their service each year, that will reduce the size of the federal workforce by upwards of 68,000 positions over a four-year mandate. It's a good start to the great landscaping project that Poilievre will have if he wins the next election. Since the ascension of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the federal public service has grown by about 111,000 staff members - from about 257,000 during Prime Minister Stephen Harper's last year in government, to roughly 368,000 in the 2023-24 fiscal year. That's an increase of about 43 per cent. In the same period, the general population grew 15 per cent. The painfully inflated bureaucracy is a huge cost to taxpayers. But it also threatens to block much-needed reforms. Nearly a third of the federal workforce was hired under Trudeau-government values, and have worked under the Trudeau government's expectations. We can likely expect some reluctance to implement a new government's desired changes, as appears to be the case in the United States. After President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures within the U.S. government, some bureaucrats have been accused of trying to conceal DEI programs by couching them in different language. States that have banned DEI in universities face a similar challenges, with schools rebranding these initiatives instead of axing them. Conservatives should brace for a resistant bureaucracy in Canada. Preparing for a workforce cull is one way to deal with it. The majority - 60,000 - of Trudeau-era hires have gone to just six federal departments and agencies. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada is one mega beneficiary, which saw its staff double (the feds now plan to cut 3,300 jobs back). The others are the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Employment and Social Development Canada, as well as the fisheries, defence and procurement departments. Some of those hires might very well be justifiable. The CRA, for example, has notoriously struggled to do its job and perhaps needed a few more hands on deck: while peer countries were recovering owed taxes identified by the Panama Papers back in 2019, the Canadian taxman didn't figure out that it was owed $76 million until 2022. But pinning all the government's faults on a lack of manpower alone would require every department to be running at perfect efficiency, which we all know isn't happening. The immigration office is struggling with massive backlogs as it cobbles together anti-racism plans, while Employment and Social Development Canada now has more work to do in administering the Liberals' new daycare and dental programs - and dreaming up new plans to expand federal diversity quotas. Similar stories can no doubt be found in other departments that have curried favour with the current government. From 2021 to 2024, Indigenous Services Canada and Crown-Indigenous Relations grew from 8,742 employees to 10,725, an increase of 23 per cent. In 2015, these departments had just 4,684 staff members. The more-than-doubling of staff has no doubt contributed to the fact that, last year, the government spent double the amount on those two Indigenous portfolios than it did on national defence. Other big spikes include: Infrastructure Canada's headcount more than doubled from 2021 to 2024; from 2015 to 2024, the Privy Council Office saw its personnel numbers rise by 77 per cent; from 2017 to 2024, the Public Health Agency of Canada nearly doubled; the government IT department of Shared Services Canada has grown by 81 per cent since 2015; and Statistics Canada ballooned by 48 per cent. The most extreme case of bloat could be found in the bowels of Women and Gender Equality Canada, which more than quadrupled its workforce under Trudeau, expanding to 443 employees in 2024, from 92 in 2015. Now that's a department that could use the Javier Milei treatment. Waste and over-extension are endemic to the current government, which is why some serious belt-tightening over the next few years shouldn't be a problem. And it's clear that even Trudeau, the public-sector cheerleader that he is, doesn't think his current employees can do the work: every year, his spending on private consulting firms rises by another billion or so, reaching $15 billion in 2023. You'd think that having vastly overpopulated offices would at least alleviate the need to run to McKinsey & Company for help every step of the way, but we've received no such blessing. Liberal ministers are notoriously disinterested in actually governing, and that is reflected in the government they've created. Under Poilievre, and his plan to cut down on his future workforce, many public servants will stomp their feet in anger at the prospect of having their numbers reduced. Conservatives mustn't be deterred. When gardens go fallow, it takes a lot of weed-whacking to restore them to their proper glory.

Weaponization of 'woke':   Word born from Black empowerment movements has become Poilievre's tool for discrediting rivals,2025.0,"Wasteful. Weird. Wacko. Woke. It may seem strange how four letters strung together, nestled among a series of alliterative buzzwords, bearing a modern definition so amorphous so as to be nearly meaningless, can evoke such clear feelings of something bad, of something reaching into places it shouldn't. But the word, lifted from the oeuvres of Black political activists, singers and writers, has became one of the terms Pierre Poilievre has relied on most to discredit his political rivals in his relentless bid to end almost a decade of Liberal rule. In ""woke,"" the Conservative leader has found the perfect word, a term right-wing movements and politicians around the world have successfully captured to brand progressives as performative activists bent on government overreach. The word is so pervasive that U.S. President Donald Trump didn't even need to say it when he promised during his inaugural address this week to scrap any policy ""trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,"" something he said would restore America ""and the revolution of common sense."" Maybe that sounds a bit familiar. Newly published research has shown that Poilievre's Conservatives have excelled at using ""woke"" to try and delegitimize progressive parties, people and policies and frame them as a threat to Canada's democratic values. To chart how Poilievre arrived at this moment, however, you have to start in the early and mid-20th century, when the term was first used to call for awareness and vigilance about systemic injustices in a profoundly prejudiced America. One of its earliest recorded uses is tied to a 1938 song by American folk and blues singer Huddie Ledbetter, who went by the stage name Lead Belly. The song is called ""Scottsboro Boys,"" and tells the story of a landmark set of race cases that saw nine Black youths falsely accused of raping two white women near Scottsboro, Ala., in 1931. In a spoken recording after the song concludes, Lead Belly warns those listening to be ""a little careful"" when they pass through the area, and to ""stay woke, keep their eyes open."" Decades later, the phrase ""stay woke"" would re-enter the musical mainstream as a refrain in Erykah Badu's 2008 track ""Master Teacher,"" and surface again during the protests and racial reckonings that followed the police killings of Michael Brown in Missouri in 2014 and George Floyd in Minnesota in 2020. The use of the word ""woke,"" with that original meaning intact, has only shown up once in Canada's parliamentary record. Several years before he became the first Black Speaker of the House of Commons, Liberal MP Greg Fergus used it to mark the start of Black History Month in 2019. ""Whereas we once divided ourselves into narrow interests based on where we or our ancestors came from, more and more we are a woke community that is working together to achieve a common interest: to be equal and to be treated as equal, equal in business, studies, law, culture, innovation, politics, government and citizenship,"" Fergus told his fellow MPs. ""That was really the only instance,"" said Patrick McCurdy, a communications professor at the University of Ottawa who traced, with two other researchers, how Conservative MPs have wielded the word in parliamentary debates. ""Then we really see the entrance of this culture war."" McCurdy and his colleagues analyzed the use of the word ""woke"" in all House of Commons and committee records from 2001 until June 2023. They found 122 instances of the word and its variations being used in a ""non 'wake up' context"" from 2019 onwards, with most of those uses delivered by Conservative MPs - and mostly only after Poilievre took the party's helm in 2022. The data shows that Poilievre first used the word once in 2021 and again in 2022 - the year when the term's use climbed to 20 instances, 19 of which were uttered by Conservative MPs. In the first six months of 2023, the word was used 88 times: 63 of those stemming from Conservatives, 33 of which were attributed to Poilievre. A Star search of the parliamentary record showed that after McCurdy's data collection period, Poilievre only said ""woke"" on seven occasions, though other Conservative MPs used it more than 70 times. It's also a word the Conservative leader has used frequently on social media and in media interviews over the past year, most recently in a lengthy conversation with media personality Jordan Peterson, in which he said Canada had been stricken with ""horrendous utopian wokeism."" Conservatives have used ""woke"" to malign a peculiar jumble of issues: race and gender inclusivity in school curriculums and workplace hiring practices, attempts to modernize Canada's military, animal rights activism, the country's telecommunications regulator, the bail system, drug supply policies, reusable grocery bags, pro-Palestinian protests and the federal carbon pricing scheme. The party did not respond to the Star's requests for comment on this story. ""When you have a sort of vague and shifty term like this, it means that when you get criticized, you can always say, 'No, no, that's not what I meant by this,' and shift to another meaning. I think it can give rise to a kind of slipperiness that can be very useful in the cut and thrust of public debate,"" said Jennifer Saul, a chair in social and political philosophy of language at the University of Waterloo. That kind of ambiguity is the hallmark of political dog whistles, said Tari Ajadi, a political science professor at McGill University. ""If you replace the word 'woke' with a skin colour, if you replace the term 'woke' with a sexual orientation, if you replace the term 'woke' with a gender ... you get a very different response. It wouldn't be allowed to be said,"" Ajadi said. The myriad uses of the word prompted McCurdy and his colleagues to sort the examples they collected into seven different definitions of ""woke."" The ""authoritarian"" definition meant the word was used to characterize something as controlling or intolerant, for example, and the ""ineffective"" definition was applied when it was used to paint a policy as actively harmful. The researchers concluded that MPs, largely Conservative ones, had succeeded in shifting the term from its social justice roots and into an understanding associated with control, positioning Poilievre ""as the only political defender of freedom against this looming totalitarian threat."" The Conservative leader has previously said as much. ""It has plenty of pretexts but only one purpose: control. It is designed to divide people by race, gender, ethnicity, religion, vaccine status and any other way one can divide people into groups. Why? It is because then one can justify having a government to control all those groups,"" Poilievre told the Commons in 2023 when asked to define the word. ""No more woke. We need freedom."" How Poilievre arrived at that definition begins not with the right, but with the left. Ajadi said the word ""woke"" was first recast from ""a very in-group thing that's talking about being socially conscious and politically conscious ... to talking generically about social justice, which it was never intended to be."" He said the term was seized by the upper-middle class, corporations, universities, and politicians who claimed it as a trendy term that came to represent a ""poorly defined set of values."" ""This is how this kind of appropriation of language emerges and unfolds, and then very quickly gets appropriated once more by the right to mock what some might call performative activism,"" Ajadi said. Indeed, the word eventually became synonymous with inauthentic virtue signalling from progressives (think Justin Trudeau, who had publicly condemned racism before admitting he had previously worn blackface), and left-leaning policies that earnestly sought to correct historic inequities, but were spun by the right as infringements on their freedoms. The result? Laws like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's so-called Stop WOKE Act - or Stop Wrongs to our Kids and Employees. (The 2022 state law, which banned education and workplace initiatives that suggest people are oppressed or privileged based on their race, gender or nation of origin, has faced legal challenges.) Such heavily politicized uses of ""woke"" left progressive politicians in Canada floundering to respond, McCurdy said. His research showed that Liberal, NDP and Bloc Québécois MPs tried to ""challenge"" Conservative uses of ""woke"" on 22 occasions, and found that they largely wound up legitimizing the word's use as a pejorative in the process. In one case, then-Liberal Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen repeatedly characterized the term as something offensive after Poilievre referred to mayors whose housing policies he opposed as ""woke."" ""He stood up in this House and insulted and denigrated three of the leading mayors of Canada's largest cities, calling them 'woke,' "" Hussen said during a 2023 debate in the Commons. ""The idea (behind the word) has become sullied, and no one's prepared to try and defend it,"" McCurdy said. The word has also been effective for Poilievre because regular people also use it to convey dissatisfaction, said Mitch Heimpel, director of policy at Enterprise Canada and a former Conservative staffer. Heimpel said he's heard people in his neighbourhood of young families use ""woke"" to refer to topics like what children are learning in schools and news stories about someone released on bail committing another crime. ""It's a reflection of a change to a system that in the mind of the person listening, is causing it to not work,"" Heimpel said. ""So it becomes a good shorthand in that way."" Both Heimpel and Saul said it is not cause for alarm that words evolve, taking on new meanings over time. ""If you try to hold language in place, you're fighting a losing game,"" Saul said. But for Ajadi, the movement of political language is deliberate, something done with a motive in mind. ""Language evolves, but I think that removes agency from the equation,"" Ajadi said. ""People make language evolve."" CAPTION: In ""woke,"" Pierre Poilievre has found the perfect word, a term right-wing movements and politicians around the world have successfully captured to brand progressives as performative activists bent on government overreach, writes Raisa Patel.

"Ford defends bid for snap election:   Threat of Poilievre victory didn't spark call for early vote, premier insists",2025.0,"Doug Ford insists he's not rushing into a snap Feb. 27 Ontario election to get in front of a federal vote expected this spring. Ontarians traditionally prefer different parties in power at Queen's Park and in Ottawa at the same time, so some Progressive Conservative strategists have privately expressed concern about their provincial electoral prospects if, as polls suggest, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is triumphant. Asked Friday if he was ""scared"" of a Poilievre victory, Ford said: ""No, not whatsoever."" Pressed on whether he was scrambling to get ahead of potential federal spending cuts should the Conservatives succeed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals, the Ontario Tory leader shook his head. ""My job - when we hopefully get a big mandate - is going to be standing up to any federal government that wants to cut health care from Ontario, cut jobs from Ontario, to tax people from Ontario,"" Ford said in Brampton, where he announced the downtown section of the still-unfinished Hazel McCallion Line LRT would be tunnelled at an undisclosed cost. Last weekend in Mississauga, Poilievre bumped into provincial Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie at a community event where they had a constructive conversation after the federal Tory chief warmly greeted her. ""Pierre mentioned to Bonnie that he is a fan of her housing plan,"" said a senior Liberal strategist, speaking confidentially to the Star in order to recount details of the impromptu chat. That's a reference to Crombie's plan to make housing more affordable by scrapping the land transfer tax for first-time homebuyers and seniors who are downsizing, eliminating development charges on new homes, and offering interest-free loans for renters facing financial emergencies that could result in evictions. ""Look, these are two politicians who are focusing their plans on what people need - they couldn't be more different than Ford and Trudeau. Makes sense that they would be talking about it,"" said the provincial Liberal. Poilievre's office would not comment on the discussion. There is no love lost between the national Conservatives and the PCs, who work closely with Trudeau's Liberals. Poilievre's ""axe the tax"" mantra is one reason he is leading in polls against Trudeau. Crombie was one of the first prominent Liberals to distance herself from the consumer price on carbon, a stance now adopted by would-be federal Grit leaders like Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland. Ford stressed the main rationale for the early Ontario vote is U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened 25 per cent levies on Canadian products as of Feb. 1. ""I'll be seeing the lieutenant-governor on Tuesday (for the issuing of the writs Wednesday). We need a mandate from the people to fight against Donald Trump's tariffs, the attack he's coming against our families, our businesses, our communities,"" he said. The Tories already have a majority at Queen's Park and an election, which will cost between $150 million and $175 million, was not supposed to be held until June 2026. ""With a strong mandate, we will be able to fight with Donald Trump to make sure we stop the tariffs and make sure that we give certainty to the people of Ontario,"" said Ford, adding it may take ""tens of billions of dollars"" in stimulus funding to keep the province's economy afloat. Aside from the Trump tariffs and a Poilievre victory, the Tories are worried about the ongoing RCMP investigation into the $8.28-billion Greenbelt scandal and would like to strike the Liberals when they may be too busy with the March 9 federal leadership race to help Crombie. Even though he was at a government announcement in Brampton, Ford struck a fiercely partisan tone, repeatedly attacking Crombie and NDP Leader Marit Stiles. ""Imagine Bonnie Crombie or Marit Stiles sitting across from President Trump, negotiating a deal. It would be an absolute disaster, and God help us if that ever happens,"" he said dismissively, noting he will go to Washington twice during the campaign on previously planned trips to lobby U.S. officials. No meeting between Ford and Trump is expected and the PC campaign will have to foot the tab for his February jaunts stateside. Rival party leaders accused Ford of being a political opportunist by triggering an election at a time of uncertainty. ""He thinks he can con Ontarians with an early election to escape his record - but we won't let him,"" said Stiles. ""Doug Ford has been on the side of wealthy insiders while life for working people has gotten harder and more expensive. How can we trust him to stand up against Donald Trump and his billionaires when he can't deliver on making life more affordable, getting people a family doctor, or building more homes?"" said the New Democratic leader. Crombie, who has yet to disclose which Mississauga riding she will run in, said ""with the looming threat of tariffs and the challenges facing our province, Ford has chosen to prioritize his own political survival over the people he was elected to serve."" ""He's not a leader - he's a coward,"" said the Liberal leader, a former Mississauga mayor. ""Doug Ford can attack me all he wants. But as premier, I wouldn't run from my responsibilities. This snap election isn't about Trump or tariffs; it's about Doug Ford scrambling to outrun the RCMP investigation into his Greenbelt scandal,"" she added. Green Leader Mike Schreiner said ""Doug Ford is putting his job before your job"" when Trump tariffs could throw 500,000 Ontarians out of work. ""All the things that a provincial government should do - build affordable homes, make sure we have doctors and nurses, safe schools - Doug Ford has walked away from,"" said Schreiner. Ford bristled when reporters raised parallels to former Liberal premier David Peterson's ill-advised 1990 snap election that led to a surprise NDP victory at a time of angst over national unity due to the collapse of the Meech Lake accord that, if passed, would have seen Quebec sign the Constitution. ""I love you media. You guys are classic. But 35 years ago, he woke up and decided to call an election. He wasn't facing the largest attack in the history of our country, attack against our families, against what they do."" Peterson is currently chair of Torstar, the Star's parent company. But there is some other Ontario political history Ford may be abiding by. According to the ""Underhill balance theory,"" Ontarians tend to opt for different parties in office at the same time provincially and federally. The phenomenon has held true for about 71 of the past 82 years. Upon dissolution next Wednesday, there are 79 Tories, including Speaker Ted Arnott, 28 New Democrats, nine Liberals, six Independents and two Greens in the 124-member house.

MacDougall: Poilievre's cuts to the public service won't be easy,2025.0,"If Pierre Poilievre has any big plans to butcher the federal public service, he will need to be careful in how he approaches his cuts For while there is ample fat to trim in the bureaucracy, the public service is like an expensive slab of Wagyu, not a cheaper striploin. Like the expensive Japanese beef, federal departments are marbled with fat. Rare is the case when an entire departmental branch can be excised like the fat along the edge of the striploin. It's more likely each branch has deadweight and artefacts of defunct programs scattered throughout, making the trimming of waste a labour-intensive exercise. And just like the turkey who doesn't vote for Christmas, no bureaucracy welcomes reform, especially when that reform means shrinkage. Should they form government, the Conservatives will have to expend a lot of political energy on public service reform. This kind of knowledge and institutional memory will be at a premium in the new government, given how few former ministers remain from the Stephen Harper era. Managing a vast federal department is hard when you know the ropes; it is virtually impossible when you don't. The asymmetry of knowledge between politician and senior mandarin is never larger than on Day One of any new mandate. What's more, the bureaucracy is a master of offering up painful choices on cuts and portraying them as the only option. If Department X is asked for Y millions in cuts, you can be sure that Y will be found from the most essential service the department provides. I can recall the Ottawa-based RCMP Musical Ride being offered up as a cut when the Harper majority government began looking for savings in the wake of the global financial crisis. Thankfully for Poilievre, Justin Trudeau is starting the process on his way out. Recent changes to immigration programs made by the current Liberal government mean the job cuts are already here. Places like Ottawa won't like it that more than 3,000 positions will be cut at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, but those cuts are a sign of what's to come. And while the usual suspects - in this case, the Canadian Employment and Immigration Union - will complain, a strong mandate from the Canadian people should help a Poilievre government overcome any stakeholder opposition. There is always a reason why not to cut - i.e. potential border chaos if Donald Trump follows through on his rhetoric - but ifs, buts and maybes can be dealt with should they arise. What Poilievre will have to offer up in return in clarity and leadership by example. It is good that the Conservative leader is beginning to put down markers on the work of the public service and how it is to be delivered. A new prime minister doesn't need to pick any fights with the people who will actually deliver his promises. Poilievre isn't being dogmatic about coming to the office five days a week as long, he says, as the work is done. And if that hybrid structure requires a bit of monitoring to enforce, then so be it. A ban on social media use by public servants outside of the communications functions would be a boon for office productivity. Ultimately, Poilievre will need to offer more specificity on his plans. We know the CBC English service is for the chopping block. If Poilievre has more wholesale chops up his sleeve, the time to communicate them is now. The rest can probably wait, especially if the plan is to actually pick through the Wagyu fat in the public service. What the Conservatives could also do is lead by example with their ministerial offices. Part of the reason the public service got so big under Trudeau is because it took its cues from the man at the top. A prime minister dragging his RCMP detail to the Bahamas can't raise an objection to a bureaucracy asking for a little more here and a little more there. If Poilievre wants lean, he can begin by choosing the leanest cuts for his PMO.

Flames call up Wranglers captain Clark Bishop to inject energy into fourth line,2025.0,"There aren't many people who have watched Clark Bishop up close recently more than Rory Kerins. The two spent the first couple months of the 2024-25 season with the Calgary Wranglers in the AHL before getting called up by the Calgary Flames. That happened for Kerins a couple weeks ago, and Bishop got the call on Thursday morning. With that in mind, Kerins has a prediction for how Flames fans are going to react to watching the Wranglers captain play. ""The fans are going to love him,"" Kerins said. ""His motor just never stops going. He's flying out there every night, he gives it all every night. That's Clark Bishop for you."" Among the fans at the Saddledome on Thursday night will be Bishop's parents, who happened to be flying in from St. John's, N.L., to visit their son.

"'An unreal person, a great hockey player': Flames recall Wranglers captain Clark Bishop",2025.0,"There aren't many people who have watched Clark Bishop up close recently more than Rory Kerins. The two spent the first couple months of the 2024-25 season with the Calgary Wranglers in the AHL before getting called up by the Calgary Flames. That happened for Kerins a couple weeks ago, and Bishop got the call on Thursday morning. With that in mind, Kerins has a prediction for how Flames fans are going to react to watching the Wranglers captain play. ""The fans are going to love him,"" Kerins said. ""His motor just never stops going. He's flying out there every night, he gives it all every night. That's Clark Bishop for you.""

Young Liberals have a plan to win the youth vote back from Pierre Poilievre,2025.0,"OTTAWA - The president of the Liberal Party of Canada's youth wing says he believes it remains the party of youth, even as many appear to have left, flocking instead to the party's chief rival: federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. Liam Olsen, who has led the Young Liberals of Canada since 2023, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed he took young people and their issues seriously, from appointing himself to be the minister of youth and establishing youth councils, to prioritize fighting climate change and ending interest on federal student loans. Now, Olsen says, it is time the party considers what's next. ""We need to build a nation for our generation,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Too many young people feel like we're being left behind, like no matter how hard we're working, or how hard we're studying, that we can't get out of debt, but that's because of student debt we accumulated through university or college. We can't keep up with rent or rising grocery prices, and we need leaders who hear our voices."" With the contest to replace Trudeau underway, the Young Liberals are calling on candidates to commit to championing a new policy pledge. Released on Thursday, the one-page document highlights different priorities it wants them to advance. They include lowering the voting age to 16, restricting temporary foreign work in regions where young people don't have jobs, ensuring youth have ""debt-free"" access to post-secondary and halving green house gas emissions by 2035. Topping the list of priorities is one that reads: ""the housing affordability crisis is a national emergency."" Olsen said candidates ought to talk about it as such. Poilievre has made housing affordability a central plank of his pitch for why Canadians should elect him as their next prime minister, targeting those under 40, for whom owning a home feels impossible because of the price. While Liberals, New Democrats and others dismiss Poilievre's efforts as nothing more than social media soundbites and slogans, months of back-to-back polling suggests his message has worked. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator, 338Canada, says Conservative are leading among those aged 18 to 34, with the Liberals and NDP battling it out for a distant second. Not only is that significant because of how Trudeau rose to power in 2015 by appealing directly to young people, but because young Canadians have traditionally veered towards the NDP. Fournier says the Conservatives began rising in the polls around when housing prices were being hit hard by interest rate hikes coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Poilievre began pounding the message that people cannot afford homes under Trudeau and Conservatives would fix things. ""That I think resonated with a lot of young voters,"" Fournier says. Since winning the Conservative leadership in 2022, Poilievre has ushered in a social media savvy not seen from previous Conservative leaders, which has driven his success among younger Canadians. That, and his style of being able to speak casually, despite having been a career politician. In his most recent wide-ranging interview with right-wing commentator and host Jordan Peterson, Poilievre discussed how many of the young people he meets are ""exhausted."" He at one point says that all young people do now ""is work."" ""I am astonished when I meet university students how much they work outside of their studies just to scrape by,"" Poilievre told Peterson. ""These kids are working 20-30 hours a week in addition to a full course load."" Fournier says it appears voters have been migrating to the Conservatives from the Liberals. ""Obviously, it's not the same voters as five or 10 years ago, but we see that, yes, the Conservatives are first among young people in almost every poll."" Whether those trying to replace Trudeau can claw back any of that support remains an open question. The winner will likely have little time to do so, given how they may find themselves campaigning in a general election in only weeks. All opposition parties have vowed to bring down the minority Liberals as soon as Parliament resumes on Mar. 24. The Liberals pick their new leader on Mar. 9. Pointing to a newly released poll suggesting the Liberals may be experiencing a bump since U.S. President Donald Trump's election, Olsen expressed optimism. He added that he is not ""focused on the past"" and that life has become more expensive for everyone. ""I don't think it's just young people."" Fournier says it is still to early to tell whether Canadians feel differently about the Liberals following Trudeau's decision to resign. Olsen said he believes all leadership candidates take youth issues seriously, having spoken with the campaigns of frontrunners Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor, as well as former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Olsen also said he has been in touch with Karina Gould's campaign, the only one of the three making a direct appeal to the party's young Liberals. On Thursday, both Gould and Freeland announced that as part of their plans to renew the party they would reinstate the role of paid national director of the young Liberals group. In her proposal, Gould, who is herself a millennial said they need the support of young Canadians if they hope to win the next election. At her campaign launch last weekend, the 37-year-old talked about having been a Liberal since she was a teen and celebrated the youth wing has having been the first to champion matters that later became government policy, like Indigenous reconciliation. She also recently held an event with around 40 young Liberals. ""Young people are looking for a leader who will listen and represent their voices. I'm ready to bring that change,"" she recently posted to X. ""It's time for a new generation of leadership - one that's fresh, energetic, and focused on building a stronger, united Canada for today and tomorrow."" Housing Minister Nate Erskine-Smith told reporters on Wednesday that he was not yet sure how he was going to be involved in the race. Talking about Gould, he said she comes from ""the same generational lens"" as he does, and hopes ""she speaks to housing and child care."" ""I have every expectation that she will."" While Gould sees her age as an advantage, Ontario MP and former cabinet minister Helena Jaczek, who is endorsing Carney, suggested young people will not necessarily vote for someone just because they are around their age.

To get an early version sent directly to your inbox, sign up here TOP STORY As the Trump administration continues to muse about slapping ruinous tariffs on Canadian exports, it's put Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in the awkward situation of reacting to a U.S. government that would very clearly prefer him as Canadian leader. U.S. President Donald Trump is not known to have ever uttered the name ""Pierre Poilievre"" in public, but he is surrounded by cabinet members and allies who have openly expressed their desire to oust Canada's incumbent Liberal government in favour of one led by Poilievre. ""This guy is going to send Trudeau packing in 2025 (finally) and start digging Canada out of the progressive mess it's in,"" Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, wrote in a May social media post referring to Poilievre. Billionaire Elon Musk - the head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency - has even openly endorsed Poilievre and repeatedly praised the Conservative leader on X.com, the social media platform that Musk owns. Perfectly articulated - Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 7, 2025 Against all this, Poilievre has been promising to retaliate in any trade war started by Trump, and has begun using the slogan ""Canada First"" as an apparent counterweight to Trump's motto of ""America First."" ""Canada will never be the 51st state. Period. We are a great and independent country,"" wrote Poilievre in one of the most widely circulated responses to Trump's repeated suggestion that Canada be annexed as a U.S. state. The Tory leader has also been conspicuously avoiding any public contact with U.S. leadership. Conservatives say they could shrink federal workforce by 17,000 yearly by not replacing leavers Fearing a new 'Roxham' because of Trump, Quebec is not joking about the border It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for a Canadian opposition leader to have at least some communication with a U.S. administration. As Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney prepared to take the reins from Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the early 1980s, he made multiple contacts with the Reagan White House, and even travelled to Washington, D.C. But Poilievre did not join the stream of Canadian political leaders visiting Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and has seemed to scoff at the suggestion. At a November press conference, Poilievre was asked if we would be prepared to go to Mar-a-Lago if invited. ""I have not been invited to that so thank you very much,"" he replied before walking away Upon Trump's Nov. 5 election win, Poilievre issued a rote statement promising to ""work with the President to benefit both countries"" - before alleging that the U.S. has been a prime beneficiary of capital flight from Canada. ""The U.S. has already taken half a trillion dollars of investment and jobs from Canada under 9 years of Trudeau,"" he wrote. Former diplomats have even opined that Poilievre is being unusually chilly with the Trump White House. Deanna Horton, a veteran of Canada's U.S. Embassy, told The Hill Times in December that the Conservatives should properly have opened communication with the president-elect. ""No matter what happens with the election, Canada will still be dealing with the Trump administration for the next four years,"" she said. That same story also quoted Christopher Sands, director of the Canada Institute at the U.S.-based Wilson Center. ""I think he's let it go too long,"" said Sands. ""The sooner he's able to make the first connection, the better."" But Poilievre hasn't disclosed any public contact with the new White House. However, one of his MPs, Jamil Jivani, made a December visit to U.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance, a longtime friend. Rather, Poilievre's communication with the Trump administration has consisted mostly of hypothetically outlining what he would do as prime minister. In an podcast with Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson that received widespread circulation in the United States, Poilievre said he would negotiate a ""great deal"" with Trump that ""will make both countries safer, richer, and stronger."" ""If you look at the history of President Trump, he negotiates very aggressively and he likes to win, but in the end, he doesn't appear to have a problem if his counterparty also wins,"" Poilievre said. As the deadline for a potential imposition of 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian imports has ticked closer, Poilievre has also stated that he would endorse retaliation. ""We would unfortunately and reluctantly have to retaliate against tariffs applied to our businesses,"" he told CTV News on Wednesday morning. ""And then we would go to the grassroots American economic interests that are on our side - the union leaders and business owners in the Midwest that use Canadian energy."" He said much the same on an interview last week with B.C.'s CHEK News. ""I would say to President Trump, I will retaliate with trade tariffs against American goods that are necessary to discourage America attacking our industries,"" he said. Candidates for the Liberal leadership have criticized Poilievre's approach to the Trump administration, with former finance minister Chrystia Freeland making the case that she would be a better negotiator with the Americans, and that the Tory leader would ""sell out"" Canada A recent Ipsos poll finds that 77 per cent of Canadians favour an immediate election in order to give the federal government a mandate to deal with Trump. Although the poll didn't specifically ask respondents what kind of mandate they would prefer, every available poll for at least the last six months has indicated that any general election would likely result in a Conservative landslide. IN OTHER NEWS At the precise moment that security at the U.S./Canada border is under a microscope due to tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, a U.S. Border Patrol agent named David Maland was shot and killed in a Monday incident just south of the border between Vermont and Quebec. Although as of yet, it's not clear if the shooting's proximity to Canada was merely incidental. A suspect killed in the shootout was a German citizen who was legally in the United States. Chrystia Freeland's campaign for the Liberal leadership has avoided the allegations of logo plagiarism that have plagued Mark Carney, but the result is campaign signs that look like they're advertising ""free land."" Stewart Phillip, Grand Chief of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, was one of the most prominent figures in the effort to sink Northern Gateway, a proposed pipeline that would have connected Alberta to the West Coast port of Kitimat. Phillip seemed to reverse himself on the pipeline this week, saying that if Canada doesn't ""build that kind of infrastructure, Trump will."" He then reversed the reversal in a statement on Wednesday, saying he doesn't support ""resuscitating dead projects."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted this photo online last night, saying that his cabinet had spent all of Tuesday in meetings to protect ""Canadians from harmful U.S. tariffs."" If the surroundings look unfamiliar, it's because instead of meeting at their usual offices on Parliament Hill, the Liberals rented out much of a luxury resort at taxpayer expense. Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello is located an hour's drive east of Ottawa, and rooms start at around $400 per night, with meals at one of its three restaurants typically costing between $40 and $70 a plate.

Poilievre promises to shrink federal public service,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he will shrink the federal public service and wants to find ways to monitor bureaucrats'productivity, because ""work isn't getting done."" In an interview with a Radio-Canada radio station in Trois-Rivières, Que., Poilievre said the federal public service has grown by 110,000 workers under the Trudeau Liberals but has failed to deliver better services to Canadians. ""We ... need fewer bureaucrats. There are way too many bureaucrats in the federal public service,"" he said in French, Tuesday. ""I'm going to reduce the size of the bureaucracy and the state."" When asked if he would sign an order like U.S. President Donald Trump did ordering federal workers back to the office five days a week Poilievre did not say yes. ""The place of work is not important to me; it's about the result. I believe there needs to be proof that the work is done,"" Poilievre told interviewer Marie-Claude Julien. Federal employees have been fighting the Liberal government's attempts to order them back to the office part-time after the COVID pandemic ended. His answer was noteworthy because Poilievre - whose suburban Carleton riding in Ottawa contains a significant number of federal public servants - has so far declined to say what he would do with the federal government's return to office mandate. Surveys of employees ordered by both the federal government and public service unions have consistently shown very high support among bureaucrats for remote work. Most federal public servants have recently been required to work from the office three days per week, and four days for executives. Asked how a Conservative government would measure whether work was being done, Poilievre mentioned ""clear tasks"" for the public service and monitoring to ensure work is completed. ""Right now, I see that the work isn't getting done in the federal government. We must put in place methods to ensure the work is done,"" he said. Poilievre's spokespeople did not respond to Postmedia questions Tuesday asking for more detail about the methods. Poilievre also said during the interview that he is the only party leader who can deal with the new Trump administration effectively, and he argued for a ""Canada first"" strategy. ""Obviously, you have to be ready for everything because the signals change from one minute to the next"" from a Trump government, he said. He added that a Conservative government would not pull out of the World Health Organization, as Trump has ordered the U.S. to do. Poilievre took a swipe at Liberal leadership hopefuls Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney, saying they couldn't stand up to Trump. He said Freeland was ""very, very weak"" when she was foreign affairs minister negotiating with the Trump administration during its first mandate. Poilievre said Carney is ""even weaker."" During her leadership campaign launch on Sunday, Freeland accused Poilievre of being ""weak"" and ready to bow down and sell Canada out to the U.S. ""He will never stand up to Donald Trump,"" Freeland said about Poilievre. ""He can't even stand up to (Alberta Premier) Danielle Smith,"" who has been arguing that oil export taxes and other retaliatory measures are not the right approach to tariff threats from Trump. cnardi@postmedia.com","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.","Nardi, Christopher",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 23, 2025",Bureaucrats; Federal employees; Political campaigns; Leadership,,2025-01-23,Sudbury Star

Poilievre dismisses question on gender:   Conservative leader says he's 'aware of two' and the issue shouldn't be a concern for Ottawa,2025.0,"Days after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged that his administration would only recognize two genders, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he's not ""aware"" of any genders aside from ""men and women"" - but said Ottawa should steer clear of the issue. In a televised interview with CP24 on Wednesday, Poilievre was asked if he agreed with Trump's order that the U.S. government should recognize only males and females. ""I don't know. Do you have any other genders that you'd like to name?"" Poilievre responded, before stating that he was ""not aware of any other genders than men and women."" The Conservative leader again asked what other genders he should be considering, prompting CP24 anchor Phil Perkins to mention those who do not conform to either gender. ""I'm only aware of two, but if you come up with another list, then you're welcome to do that. But I'm aware of two,"" Poilievre said. ""And, as far as I'm concerned, we should have a government that just minds its own damn business and leaves people alone to make their own personal decisions. That's the kind of government I'm going to run."" Poilievre's comments landed two days after Trump, in his inauguration speech on Monday, declared ""it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."" He signed an executive order later that day that, among other actions, pledged to recognize that ""women are biologically female, and men are biologically male,"" ensure that government agencies and employees should use the term ""sex"" rather than ""gender"" in policies and documents, and that any forms requiring someone's sex to be noted should only list male or female and include no options for gender identity. While sex is understood to refer to biological characteristics, gender is a much more broad term that encompasses people's roles, identities, expressions and behaviours. The move sparked fears that the Trump administration was moving quickly to roll back LGBTQ rights and erase gender nonconforming identities, such as those who are non-binary and transgender. Poilievre was also asked, if he were to become prime minister, whether he would ask American officials to recognize Canadian passports that carry the ""X"" designation, which is for document-holders who identify as neither male nor female. Trump's edict also knocked down the Biden administration's 2022 decision to allow the same designation to be used on American passports. ""I have to be honest with you,"" Poilievre said. ""I just saw your segment on homeless encampments that are popping up all over Toronto. We've got 25 per cent of our population in poverty. Housing costs have doubled. Crime is rampaging through our streets. I just find it to be a strange priority to spend time talking about this."" Poilievre's office did not directly answer the Star's questions about whether the leader's remarks meant he did not believe non-binary and other gender nonconforming people exist, or whether he was officially committing to leaving untouched federal government policies like passport markers, initiatives focused on improving the representation of equity-seeking groups within the public service, and the construction of gender-neutral washrooms in places like Parliament Hill. ""If Liberals want to talk about different labels that they have for gender that they want to put on passports in the United States, they can do that. I'm going to talk about the things that will bring home Canada's promise,"" Poilievre said in the interview. According to the country's 2021 census, 100,815 Canadians are transgender or non-binary. Fae Johnstone, the executive director of national advocacy organization Queer Momentum, said Poilievre needs to be clear about what his comments mean. She said his language Wednesday signalled that the Conservative leader was not prepared to speak up for gender nonconforming Canadians and their rights at a dangerous time for those populations. ""He's speaking out of both sides of his mouth,"" said Johnstone, who said that while she fully agrees with Poilievre that Ottawa should not meddle in people's private lives, she did not ""trust"" the leader to live up to that promise. Johnstone pointed to the Conservative party's 2023 convention, which saw delegates pass a resolution that would ban medical interventions to treat those under 18 experiencing ""gender confusion or dysphoria."" Poilievre said at the time that he was not bound to adopt the convention's policy resolutions.

"Poilievre has axe, little to swing at",2025.0,"With populism now a must-have accessory in politics, there's nothing better to be these days than a populist running against a patrician. But, ever since that dream gig collapsed for Pierre Poilievre with the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Conservative leader has been struggling. The problem is that Liberal leadership front-runners Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney simply don't come across as patricians nearly as well. Unlike Trudeau, they weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths nor do they holiday with billionaires on private Caribbean islands. U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden belligerence toward Canada also throws a spanner into Poilievre's previously smoothly running election machinery. If nothing more, Trump's gunslinger swagger about annexing Canada takes the focus here off the Liberal government's carbon tax as the greatest danger that could befall Canadians. U.S. troops massing at the border could pose more of a problem. And with Freeland and Carney now both abandoning the carbon tax, Poilievre has lost the one thing he had resembling a policy position. He's left with an axe but nothing to wield it against. Besides, with Trump's threats to Canada now the central focus, Poilievre is at a disadvantage. He clearly has less knowledge and experience dealing with international trade wars and deranged economic hit men than Freeland or Carney. As for the possibility that Poilievre might have an advantage since Trump would regard him as a fellow right-wing climate denier - that didn't work out so well for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. Despite her outsized credentials as a right-winger, loopy conspiracy theorist and long-time supplicant to Big American Oil, her pilgrimage to Washington to win special treatment for Alberta appears to have been a dud. She managed to get no closer to the inauguration than to observe it from a party at the Canadian embassy. With so many right-wingers sucking up to the megalomaniac Trump, it's hard to stand out or even get noticed, let alone secure any favours. This could leave Poilievre back at square one, needing a fresh case for why Canadians should vote for a caustic, antagonistic man whose accomplishments would be hard to summarize. (Quick, name two, or even one.) Poilievre's lack of notable accomplishments (with the exception of being a finalist in an essay competition requiring contestants to explain what they would do as prime minister) hasn't been much noticedperhaps because it fits easily with his cultivated persona as just an ordinary guy. Ordinary or not, Poilievre has always lacked a common touch; his awkwardness in dealing with regular people was nicely captured by Globe and Mail columnist Shannon Proudfoot when she described Poilievre ""talking about normal people like zoo exhibits."" One suspects he's more at ease engaging with rich, elite men - as he did at the string of private Conservative fundraisers last year across the country. Of course, neither Carney nor Freeland exactly come across as populists (although Carney is more charming and relaxed). For genuine populism, we must look beyond Liberals and Conservative ranks - to someone like Charlie Angus, the fiery NDP MP who, sadly, has announced he won't run again. There's an authenticity about Angus when he passionately defends workers' rights. Maybe that's because he actually had a working-class upbringing in Scarborough. He looks like he could still dig a ditch or flip a hamburger - jobs he actually did in his youth, while Poilievre was organizing conservative youth clubs. It's too bad we can't have less of Poilievre's phoney right-wing populism, which only benefits the rich, and more of Angus's real working-class populism. Poilievre's disconnect with the working class is highlighted in a brief TV comedy sketch made 15 years ago by Rick Mercer. It depicts the stunned reactions of workers as they learn that Poilievre, who favoured restricting unemployment benefits, had managed to qualify for a full parliamentary pension by the age of 31. It's hard to imagine anyone who watches this brilliantly funny sketch reacting by saying, yeah, that's the guy I'm voting for.

"Terry Glavin: Listen to Poilievre, recall Parliament now",2025.0,"However you interpret the American president's threats to cripple the Canadian economy for whichever of the illogical reasons he cites, and whatever anyone makes of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre,he's dead right about this: Canada needs to quickly develop a plan for retaliatory tariffs, and that means Parliament has to be immediately reconvened. Unless and until that happens, all we have is a kind of extraparliamentary provisional government in the form of the Council of the Federation, which consists of 13 premiers of Canada's 10 provinces and the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Or rather 12 premiers, now that Alberta's Danielle Smith has struck out on her own to engage in freelance diplomacy on behalf of Alberta's oil companies. In any case, put them all together and they still have no constitutional authority to negotiate with a foreign power, which is Ottawa's business, and the council carries a national mandate every bit as tenuous as the hold Justin Trudeau maintains over the paralyzed federal government. As things stand, the House of Commons will remain effectively under lock and key until Justin Trudeau is replaced by his own party in a leadership race, Parliament is recalled and a failed confidence motion triggers a federal election. This rigmarole was precipitated by a prime minister whose own party and caucus wanted him gone even before Donald Trump decided to rampage onto the scene. It could end up prolonging Canada's democratic interregnum until early May. Faced with a rupture in Canada-U.S. relations that could cost 1.5 million Canadian jobs, a massive economic contraction and supply-chain mayhem, just for starters, recalling the House just to formally and officially defeat the minority Liberals in a confidence vote would be wholly insufficient in light of the crisis Canada is facing. For one thing, the $1.3-billion border-armouring plan Ottawa announced last week, which will merely address one of the concocted pretexts President Trump has cited for his belligerence, is technically unfunded because there's no sitting Parliament to authorize the expenditure. ""We also need retaliatory tariffs, something that requires urgent Parliamentary consideration,"" Poilievre said Tuesday. This stands in stark contrast to the clever talk in certain Conservative circles that we shouldn't be talking about tariffs at all, that we should be trying to persuade the Americans how helpful we can be in their delusions of grandeur and Trump can be appeased if we just slobber on his slippers and bend to his will. By all means, yes, the Americans should be made to understand how good a deal they're getting out of our $700-billion annual trading relationship, and yes, Canadian diplomats should make the case to American lawmakers that Trump's claims about Canada enjoying a $200-billion annual ""subsidy"" in the relationship is a jumble of falsehoods and illiteracy, but if it's a North American fortress they want we can help them build that, too, whatever it's supposed to mean. But all that is for Canadians to decide, through their own Parliament. And at the moment, we don't have one. ""Canada has never been so weak,"" Poilievre said, ""and things have never been so out of control. Liberals are putting themselves and their leadership politics ahead of the country."" That's a hard argument to beat. On Jan. 6, Governor General Mary Simon granted Trudeau his request to prorogue Parliament to allow the Liberals time to pick his successor - a move which may have been unconstitutional. On Jan. 7, Trump said he intended to apply ""economic force"" to carry out his intention of absorbing Canada as the 51st American state. Last week, ruling on an application filed by theJustice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms, the Federal Court of Canada's Chief Justice Paul S. Crampton granted an expedited hearing on an ""urgent"" basis to consider the legality of the Governor General's decision. In light of Trump's threats, Judge Crampton ruled against the Liberal government's lawyers: ""The fact remains that there would be no opportunity for Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions, including by availing itself of legislative tools at its disposal, for a significant period during which Canada will likely face a grave challenge."" Quite apart from the sloppy constitutional hygiene involved, to prorogue Parliament at a moment like this, and for the reasons Trudeau offered, was contemptuous of Canadian democracy. ""Open Parliament. Take back control,"" Poilievre said Tuesday. ""Put Canada First."" Ontario Premier Doug Ford seems to be ready to do just that. Wanting what he's called a ""clear mandate"" to ask for what could be painful sacrifices from Ontarians in the adoption of retaliatory actions against U.S. business interests, the Ontario Conservative leadership has alerted the party that a provincial election is likely imminent. ""I'm going to use every tool in the toolbox to protect the people of Ontario,"" Ford said. ""We need a clear mandate, not for tomorrow, not for the next day, for four years of dealing with our American friends."" So does the federal government. Trump did not follow through with his pledge to sign an executive order immediately after his inauguration on Monday to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. Instead, after affixing his signature to dozens of executive orders, Trump told reporters the 25 per cent tariffs will be in place Feb. 1, because Canada, like Mexico, is ""allowing vast numbers of people ... and fentanyl to come in."" Canada is not allowing vast numbers of people or significant amounts of fentanyl to enter the United States, especially when compared with Mexico. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials say 19.5 kilograms of fentanyl was seized at Canadian border points last year, compared to 9,570 kilograms seized on the U.S. Mexico border. U.S. officials recorded more than two million ""encounters"" on the Mexico border last year, about 10 times the number of encounters on the Canada-U.S. border, and ""encounters"" can mean all sorts of situations. Whatever the Feb. 1 deadline turns out to mean, Trump has given his officials until April 1 to prepare a report on migrants and fentanyl from Mexico, Canada and China. So there's time to talk sense to American lawmakers, and as chair of the Council of the Federation, Ontario's Ford will be leading a delegation to Washington, D.C. on Feb. 12 ""to advocate for maintaining strong Canada-U.S. relations."" On the agenda: employment, the economy, energy, critical mineral supply chains, border security and immigration. While American law grants the president tremendous leeway in foreign trade and in the executive application of tariffs, Congress can restrain the president if it wants to, and there are midterm elections two years down the road. The Republicans enjoy a small majority in the Senate, 53-47, and in the House their edge is paper thin: 218-215. So there's hope that if Trump means war, and Canada retaliates with tariffs or export restrictions that make key states and districts sting, we might be able to fight this thing. But we need a plan. Ottawa needs a mandate. And for that we need a Parliament, and we need it now.

Poilievre vows to shrink size of federal public service: 'Work isn't getting done',2025.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he will shrink the federal public service and wants to find ways to monitor bureaucrats' productivity, because ""work isn't getting done."" In an interview with a Radio-Canada radio station in Trois-Rivières, Que., Poilievre said the federal public service has grown by 110,000 workers under the Trudeau Liberals but has failed to deliver better services to Canadians. ""We... need fewer bureaucrats. There are way too many bureaucrats in the federal public service,"" he said in French, Tuesday. ""I'm going to reduce the size of the bureaucracy and the state."" When asked if he would sign an order like U.S. President Donald Trump did ordering federal workers back to the office five days a week Poilievre did not say yes. ""The place of work is not important to me; it's about the result. I believe there needs to be proof that the work is done,"" Poilievre told interviewer Marie-Claude Julien. Federal employees have been fighting the Liberal government's attempts to order them back to the office part-time after the COVID pandemic ended. His answer was noteworthy because Poilievre - whose suburban Carleton riding in Ottawa contains a significant number of federal public servants - has so far declined to say what he would do with the federal government's return to office mandate. 'Very cautious' optimism in Canada as Trump does not enforce tariffs 'for now' Trudeau, premiers unite against potential U.S. tariffs, while Smith withholds full support Surveys of employees ordered by both the federal government and public service unions have consistently shown very high support among bureaucrats for remote work. Most federal public servants have recently been required to work from the office three days per week, and four days for executives. Asked how a Conservative government would measure whether work was being done, Poilievre mentioned ""clear tasks"" for the public service and monitoring to ensure work is completed. ""Right now, I see that the work isn't getting done in the federal government. We must put in place methods to ensure the work is done,"" he said. Poilievre's spokespeople did not respond to National Post questions Tuesday asking for more detail about the methods. Poilievre also said during the interview that he is the only party leader who can deal with the new Trump administration effectively, and he argued for a ""Canada first"" strategy. ""Obviously, you have to be ready for everything because the signals change from one minute to the next"" from a Trump government, he said. He added that a Conservative government would not pull out of the World Health Organization, as Trump has ordered the U.S. to do. Poilievre took a swipe at Liberal leadership hopefuls Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney, saying they couldn't stand up to Trump. He said Freeland was ""very, very weak"" when she was foreign affairs minister negotiating with the Trump administration during its first mandate. Poilievre said Carney is ""even weaker."" During her leadership campaign launch on Sunday, Freeland accused Poilievre of being ""weak"" and ready to bow down and sell Canada out to the U.S. ""He will never stand up to Donald Trump,"" Freeland said about Poilievre. ""He can't even stand up to (Alberta Premier) Danielle Smith,"" who has been arguing that oil export taxes and other retaliatory measures are not the right approach to tariff threats from Trump. Poilievre on Tuesday issued a statement saying Canada needed to use retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. as he called on the prime minister to end his prorogation of Parliament to prepare the response.

"Why this money manager is buying Aritzia:   Parts of the market are overvalued, but the market can still grow into those higher valuations, Bruce Campbell says",2025.0,"THE MOVER While many investors see the market as overvalued and expect prices to drop significantly in the months ahead, money manager Bruce Campbell has a more nuanced view. “When we look at the markets, overall, we’re not looking at it from a valuation standpoint,” says the founder and portfolio manager at StoneCastle Investment Management Inc. in Kelowna, B.C., whose investing style includes technical and fundamental analysis. Mr. Campbell agrees parts of the market are overvalued, particularly some large- and megacap stocks, but says the market can still grow into those higher valuations. “Right now, everything we see is telling us we should be optimistic,” says Mr. Campbell, who oversees $55-million in assets. When the market eventually corrects, money can be made buying stocks at cheaper valuations, he says. And not every stock will be affected. “There will still be companies that can perform [in a down market],” Mr. Campbell says. His portfolio, which focuses on North American-based smalland mid-cap companies, has returned 3.5 per cent over the past year. Its annualized return since inception in September, 2009, is 4.7 per cent. The performance is as of Dec. 31, net of fees. The Globe spoke with Mr.Campbell recently about what he’s been buying and selling. NAME THREE STOCKS YOU OWN TODAY AND WHY. Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd. (HASH-X), a Calgarybased cannabis company, is a stock we started to buy in late December and into January. This company has built up revenue by selling cannabis products, such as vapes and dried flower, and is generating a profit. It recently moved into the cultivation space after buying a facility from Delta 9 Cannabis Inc. out of Delta 9’s CCAA [Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act] process. The company is taking advantage of the challenging environment in the cannabis space. It’s a risky, competitive, and highly regulatory business, but we believe opportunities remain as the market morphs and moves around. Zedcor Inc. (ZDC-X) is a stock we’ve owned since April, 2024. The Calgary-based firm started as an oilfield services company, renting equipment such as generators and mobile office structures. It has since expanded into security and surveillance in and beyond the energy sector, including big box retailers and construction sites in Canada and the U.S. Its business is growing dramatically in the U.S. The stock has risen by more than 500 per cent over the past year. The higher valuation is a risk. It also has a lot of competition in the security and surveillance space. There’s also the potential competitive impact of artificial intelligence. Zedcor shares were under pressure mid-week after it announced financing to raise money for its U.S. expansion. Many investors were concerned the company would need to take on more debt to have the cash to ramp up the number of towers built each month. They instead raised equity. I heard that the demand for the issue was very large. When these issues happen, the stock will often come under pressure, as it did. Looking out longer-term for the stock, we believe the issue is a net positive. Aritzia Inc. (ATZ-T), the Vancouver-based fashion retailer, is a stock we just started buying a few days ago. Its numbers have been strong, and it’s doing very well with its expansion into the U.S. We’ve been waiting for a pullback but it hasn’t [happened], so we’ve taken a small position. If it pulls back, we’ll add more. We owned it in the past and did well on it. The management team has done a good job growing the company in an industry in which trends come and go. The risk is that the valuation and sentiment are high, based on expectations for its expansion, so if things don’t go well that could impact the stock price. NAME A STOCK YOU SOLD RECENTLY. Carvana Co. (CVNA-N), the Tempe, Ariz.-based e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars, is a stock we started selling in November after owning it for about a year. Its business has been great, but its growth is slowing. It has gone from one of the bigger positions in our portfolio to one of the smaller ones. Hindenburg Research said in a recent report that it was shorting Carvana, which has put some pressure on the stock price. [Editor’s note: The report accused the retailer of insider trading and accounting manipulation. Carvana called the report “intentionally misleading and inaccurate. ”] It could be one we go back into at some point. We’re just sitting tight, watching it to decide what to do with our last little piece.

Lions' Campbell knows that change is a part of the game,2025.0,"It's one down for the Detroit Lions and likely another still to go. The long expected departure of Lions offensive co-ordinator Ben Johnson appears officials as his agency, Priority Sports, announced on social media that he would be the next head coach of the Chicago Bears. It's not the only staff loss the Lions are expecting this off-season with defensive co-ordinator Aaron Glenn set to do a second interview for the New York Jets' vacant head coach post on Tuesday and then a second meeting with the New Orleans Saints on Wednesday. ""I would expect to lose both, but I haven't been told anything,"" Lions' head coach Dan Campbell said hours before news of Johnson's departure became public. ""I just, I've got a feeling, but I'm prepared to lose both."" Johnson was hired as an offensive quality control coach in 2019 and promoted to tight ends coach in 2020. Campbell retained him when he was hired in 2021 after Matt Patricia was fired. In Campbell's first season, Johnson was promoted to pass game co-ordinator after Anthony Lynn was fired as offensive co-ordinator when the team started 0-8. Johnson was promoted to offensive co-ordinator after the season. Under the 38-year-old Johnson, Detroit has had a top 10 offence the past two seasons and the club's 28.2 offensive points per game from 2022 to 2024 in the most in the NFL. Like the club has all season in dealing with injuries, Campbell said in no way does the departure of one or both co-ordinators diminish the fact he still feels the club will remain a Super Bowl contender. ""Our window is open,"" Campbell said. ""That's my job, to replenish and find the next man up and the guy who's going to give us the best chance to have success on both sides of the ball. Absolutely, it would be a loss, but yet man, we move forward. This train rolls and I'll find the next best guys for us."" Detroit Lions' defensive co-ordinator Aaron Glenn is set to interview for a second time for the head coaching post with the New York Jets on Tuesday and the New Orleans Saints on Wednesday. As with promoting Johnson back in 2021, Campbell believes there are people currently on Detroit's staff that could be promoted to fill either role. ""I think we've got guys on staff that I think are more than qualified and would be outstanding in those roles, but that does not mean that I'm not looking outside either,"" Campbell said. ""So, I'm not going to be in a hurry. I'm not in a mad dash. ""No matter what happens, I want to do what's right by our team and what I believe is going to - those guys will be able to stand in front of that room and command respect and get everybody going in the same direction and will, ultimately, deliver the same message that I'm delivering."" When he was hired by the Lions, Campbell was a first-time head coach and hiring Lynn, who was a former head coach, seemed like the perfect fit to get experience on the staff. But, as Campbell has grown, and Johnson has shown, it's not always about experience being the key to success and the former NFL tight end has his own offensive ideas. ""What do you learn?"" Campbell said. ""OK man, I just need (to) make sure that I am heavily involved, however we go. Man, I am very offensive heavy, I think is the best way to say that. I'm going to be involved, no matter what, because I think that's best for our offence."" Despite Saturday's disappointing loss to the Washington Commanders in the divisional playoffs, Campbell said the philosophy of the team will not change, even if there are changes to the coaching staff. ""No, I don't see philosophy changing,"" Campbell said. ""What we are is what we are and we've been that way since I've been here. ""A couple of things will get tweaked, just the nature of new co-ordinators if that happens, because you want it to be kind of their flavour, their style with it, but yet what I want is what we're going to do and what we're about."" jpparker@postmedia.com twitter.com/winstarparker",The Windsor Star (Online); Windsor,Windsor,"Parker, Jim",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 21, 2025",Professional football,"Nom: Detroit Lions; NAICS: 711211; Nom: New York Jets; NAICS: 711211; Nom: National Football League--NFL; NAICS: 711211, 813990; Nom: New Orleans Saints; NAICS: 711211",2025-01-21,The Windsor Star
Your letters: Poilievre's lack of policies exposed without Trudeau to attack,2025.0,"All we have heard from the federal Conservative leader are shallow slogans, catchphrases and meaningless schoolyard taunts. His only policy was to attack Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which became a tired refrain bereft of any visionary qualities. ""Axe the tax, spike the hike, common-sense Conservatives"": is he in Grade 3? This is a man who chummed around with the freedom convoy people and is currently turning himself into a pretzel trying to cover up his love-in for Trump and somehow stand up for his own country. Yes, it was time for Trudeau to step down, but Pierre Poilievre is a lost soul without someone he can heap abuse on. Is this as good as it gets? Ian Wishart, Calgary Carney can't save Liberals The Liberal party strategy is still alive and well, to divide us as a nation and try to divert us from their 10 years of incompetence by seducing us into this Team Canada puffery, anti-Alberta oil and gas protectionism and propping up a new messiah in Mark Carney. He is a socialist in sheep's clothing. Don't be fooled for a minute with launching his campaign in Edmonton, pretending he embraces all Canadians. For all of his high-powered credentials as governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, he has no experience as a sitting MP who would know what it means to press the flesh of a common voter. He represents a desperate attempt by a failed party trying to stay in power. We need a change in government, and Pierre Poilievre and the Conservative Party need to be given the opportunity to govern. Murray Hunter, Calgary Smith damaged Alberta's reputation I am embarrassed to be an Albertan. When the whole country needs to unite against an economic threat from U.S. President Donald Trump, Premier Danielle Smith did not support the federal government's plan to deal with the potential of tariffs because she didn't want Alberta energy or products to be used as a retaliatory tool. While two other energy-producing provinces signed the joint communique, her refusal to sign significantly harms Canada's negotiation strategy. She has always been an apologist for Trump, as evidenced by the comments she made when she was a talk-show host. Although she went to Mar-a-Lago to kiss the ring, she did not attend the meeting with the other premiers in person. That sends an interesting message to where her allegiance lies. She needs to put away her continued battle with Ottawa and put Canada first. Leon Cygman, Airdrie Put Alberta before Canada I find it puzzling how premiers are suddenly finding uranium in Saskatchewan and oil in Alberta as important bargaining chips to prop up the industries in their provinces. Newfoundland Premier Andrew Furey even went so far as to call our oil industry a queen on the chess board. That's kind of saying the quiet part out loud. They don't care about our livelihood. We're just a chess piece for their game. I won't ever forget what other provinces did to Alberta's ambitions, just 10 years ago, landlocking our oil. Premier Danielle Smith is doing the right thing, putting our jobs and economy first. I am tired of other premiers spewing nonsense about national unity.

Why Quebec's No. 1 separatist is spoiling for a fight with Pierre Poilievre,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Pierre Poilievre's recent interview with Jordan Peterson was popular with a lot of people, judging by its nearly four million YouTube views. But Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon didn't like what he heard, and he's spoiling for a fight with the federal Conservative leader in what looks like a preview of what Poilievre can expect as he faces off against Quebec nationalists in an upcoming federal election. Appearing on Peterson's podcast earlier this month, Poilievre said that if the separatist PQ is comfortably leading in the polls provincially, it's because of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After all, he said, separatists ""had been completely obliterated in the Harper era."" ""Separatism was completely dead in Quebec and now it's making a resurgence and... the leader of the PQ has actually been making economic arguments in favour of separatism,"" Poilievre said. But because the Liberal government ""has been such a colossal disaster for our national economy, the separatists are now able to make the argument that they would be better off separating from that calamity."" For Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, known as PSPP, the remarks were too rich. He said Poilievre showed ""a contempt for Quebec in a context where the independence movement is only (perceived as) a threat."" ""That's all it comes down to. There is no will to understand. There is no will to give legitimacy to demands that are in fact identical in some respects to Canadian demands,"" he said at a Jan. 7 press conference. Le parti conservateur de Pierre Poilievre ne va pas gouverner en fonction des intérêts du Québec. Il se préoccupe des intérêts de sa base électorale qui est dans l'Ouest canadien. D'autant plus qu'il n'a même pas besoin du Québec pour former le prochain gouvernement. L'avenir... - Paul St-Pierre Plamondon (@PaulPlamondon) January 7, 2025 Poilievre always seems ready to advocate for Western Canada, St-Pierre Plamondon said. What, he demanded, would the Conservative leader, if elected prime minister, do for Quebec? ""The immediate future of Quebec in Canada, under a Pierre Poilievre government, does not bode well,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said. The two have been sparring back and forth ever since. ""I'm not here to defend the interests of one region over another. I'm here to restore Canada's promise so that everyone who works hard can earn a good living, buy an affordable home, and raise a family in a safe neighbourhood,"" Poilievre said in a social media post a few days later. The Tory leader then went on the offensive, attacking the PQ leader. ""You are afraid that a Conservative government will respect Quebec's autonomy because it would undermine your arguments in favour of sovereignty,"" he said. Quebecers, who are accustomed to being wooed by political leaders, are still waiting for Poilievre to tell them what he plans to offer their province. His predecessors had proposals specifically for Quebec, and former federal Tory leader Erin O'Toole presented a ""Quebec platform"" in the 2021 election. Stephen Harper's Conservative government even passed a motion in the House of Commons ""that Quebecers form a nation within a united Canada."" Poilievre says he believes in ""responsible federalism,"" while arguing that Harper's approach shows Quebec gets more respect from Conservatives than it has during nine years of Liberal government. As prime minister, he said, ""Quebecers will be winners."" At least some Quebecers, it seems, have yet to be convinced. ""This is an initial position, but when he talks about 'responsible federalism', it is a new expression that his Conservative predecessors did not necessarily use. He will have to clarify his thinking in relation to what this can mean concretely for Quebec,"" said Marc-André Leclerc, who was chief of staff for then Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. St-Pierre Plamondon's party won't be on the ballot in the upcoming federal election, but because it's polling as the most popular provincial party in Quebec, its leader has managed to get Poilievre's attention, and perhaps under his skin, too. He asked Poilievre if he would commit to legislating to prohibit federal spending power in areas of provincial jurisdiction, to stop challenging Quebec's controversial Bill 21 restricting religious symbols for some public employees, to give Quebec full power over immigration to the province and over cultural spending in the province. That wasn't all: St-Pierre Plamondon has challenged Poilievre to commit to increasing the federal health transfer to Quebec to $6 billion (Trudeau turned that same request down last year, offering $900 million instead). He's also calling on the Conservatives to promise never to let an oil pipeline pass through Quebec, and to cancel any federal financial incentives to the oil and gas industry. And he wants Poilievre to vow that he'll let Quebec have a single tax return and collect revenue on behalf of both governments, something Conservatives have backed in the past ""I also offer to debate these fundamental issues in person, to get to the heart of the matter,"" wrote St-Pierre Plamondon on social media Speak French, understand Quebec or don't run for party leadership, some Liberals say Poilievre would be a 'catastrophe' for Quebec, Trudeau's lieutenant warns Legault He hasn't yet got an answer. Conservatives did not respond when National Post asked. But that may work just fine for St-Pierre Plamondon, whose shadow boxing with Conservatives only improves his standing provincially, said Geneviève Tellier, political science professor at the University of Ottawa. ""It gives him an opponent against whom he knows he will score points because on certain issues Pierre Poilievre will have difficulty defending himself,"" she said. When the PQ dares the Conservative leader to stand with Quebec against multiculturalism, Poilievre can't really win, said Tellier. ""But it would be difficult for him to say 'oh no, no, I don't like that.' I mean, there is a consensus in Canada. So, there are certainly advantages for PSPP in asking to confront Poilievre,"" she said. St-Pierre Plamondon knows that separatist sentiment in Quebec isn't exactly boiling over: it's been stable for months at around 35 per cent. Yet the PQ hasn't been this popular in decades - in large part because of the sinking fortunes of Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec government. It may not last. Like Poilievre, PSPP is leading a popular opposition party that's salivating for an election, scheduled in Quebec for next year. By then, they could both find themselves in very different situations, said Leclerc. ""The two will have to work together, because even for Mr. St-Pierre Plamondon, if he wins the election, there will be no referendum two weeks later. He will have no choice but to work with the federal government, and he will have no choice but to gain things,"" he said. ""And that will involve collaborating with Pierre Poilievre.""

Jan. 12 Jamie Watt argues that our leaders need to step up and protect Canada's identity. He suggests that all of us have a part to play in this, though he doesn't provide specifics. Here are some things regular Canadians can do to send the right message to U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and his followers. If Americans wants to impose dramatic tariffs on Canadian products, then Canadians should stop buying American ones. We should cancel all vacations to the United States and visit other destinations instead, such as the Caribbean, Bermuda, or better still, somewhere in Canada. We should walk right past American retailers like Walmart and Costco when other options are available and look for ""Made in Canada"" tags, leaving those ""Made in USA"" products on store shelves. Finally, we should select the foods that our grandparents relied upon: apple juice rather than orange juice, blueberries and pears from Canada rather than from California. Garden-centre greenhouses need to move quickly to grow fresh vegetables such as lettuce and peas. These are just few ideas. I'm sure my fellow Canadians can develop other ways to bypass American goods in favour of supporting Canadian producers so that we can build a stronger, more resilient economy - even as Trump tries to destroy it. Brian Moore, Brantford, Ont. Canada is passing through difficult times because of a lack of leadership at the federal level and an absence of unity at the provincial level. The outcome of the first ministers meeting in Ottawa last Tuesday was disappointing and discouraging. There's disagreement in the nation's ranks and everyone is playing their own flute. Ontario Premier Doug Ford took a stand and emphasized the need for unity. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith took a different kind of stand: she appeared to care only for her province, not for Canada as a whole. A nation is more than just a geographical region: it is a complex union of cultures, histories and values. In a situation such as this, we should be focusing on the importance of unity, the role of the provinces in our federation and the factors that contribute to a nation's strength. Yet our first minsters failed to come together to form a common front against Donald Trump's tariff threats. Still, we have time. Canadian leaders need to take unified stand to face the challenges ahead. It needs courage, and courage is nothing more than an affirmative answer to the shocks of existence. Mehdi Rizvi, Pickering Let's remember that Justin Trudeau is still the prime minister. International relations is his bailiwick. He should be facing off with Donald Trump, flanked by the leaders of the opposition parties and the premiers of the provinces and territories. It must be made clear that regardless of the outcome of the federal election in Canada, Trump will face a united front. Instead, Doug Ford appears to be angling for the job of prime minister - a job that is not his to apply for - when he ought to be rallying the Ontario electorate. He ought to be reminding them that we've faced bullies in the past and won. Adolf Hitler was defeated by the Allied powers. That's how you deal with bullies, by forming defensive alliances. Moses Shuldiner, Toronto I have never voted for Doug Ford and probably never will, but I am 100 per cent behind him in his approach to Donald Trump. If you don't stand up to bullies, they will always pick on you. If you do - and if you can land a few punches of your own - they will think twice before messing with you again. Elliot Keller, Toronto Alberta's refusal to stand with the rest of Canada against Donald Trumps tariff threats is unacceptable but not surprising. Alberta's political leaders have been all about themselves for decades. Their only concern has appeared to be selling oil to American interests at Canadians' expense. They need to stop playing into Trump's hands for their own selfish purposes and start supporting the best country in the world. That country is Canada, and Alberta needs to realize as much. Rick Lockman, Orillia, Ont. Who will protect Toronto's owls? 'We have to act now': Deaths of two snowy owls at Tommy Thompson Park reignite calls for rodenticide ban, Jan. 5 I was disappointed that the Star went ahead with publishing this story before having determined whether rodenticide was, in fact, the cause of death for these birds. I can't stress enough how essential it is to wait for a pathologist to confirm the presence of rodenticide in an animal's tissues before jumping to conclusions. If you come across a sick or dead wild animal in Ontario, your first call should be to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative. Submitting samples to them lets us monitor rodenticides' effect on wildlife. Carly Davenport, Toronto TDSB paid-leave stats shocking The TDSB has spent tens of millions placing school staff on paid leave. It's working to change its practices, Jan. 16 The Toronto District School Board paid $35 million in salary to 621 teachers, principals and staff over a three-year period to stay home while under investigation for misconduct. The board calls it ""home assignment,"" but this a misnomer, as the word ""assignment"" suggests that the employee in question is working from home. It should be termed ""suspension with pay"" to reflect the reality that the employee is not allowed in the school while being investigated. I was shocked that the average length of a ""home assignment"" for the TDSB principals and vice-principals was eight months, while the provincial average was under four. Even more striking was the fact that some investigations take years to complete. I look forward to the upcoming report, which is expected to identify the specific types of misconduct that have allegedly been occurring within the TDSB. Mike Faye, Toronto Carney no fiscal conservative Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre say a lot about themselves with their choices of interviewers, Arthur, Jan. 16 Bruce Arthur was wrong to state that Mark Carney is ""likely a financially conservative"" politician. I am currently reading Carney's 2021 book, ""Value(s): Building a Better World for All."" His economic analysis offers a progressive perspective on how we can use the values of ""sustainability, solidarity and responsibility"" to deal with existential problems such as climate change, world hunger and the obscene and growing gap between rich and poor. He lays out a blueprint for building a just future for our children, our grandchildren and generations to come.

Halt of ‘Lost Canadians’ bill could mean citizenship for thousands born to parents with no ties to Canada:   The bill is meant to reverse a change by Stephen Harper’s Conservative government in 2009 that stripped children of a Canadian parent born outside Canada of their automatic right to citizenship,2025.0,"Ottawa’s failure to pass a bill granting citizenship to Lost Canadians – children born abroad to foreign-born Canadians – could lead to thousands of people whose parents have never been here automatically qualifying as citizens. Bill C-71 was one of 26 pieces of legislation stopped in its tracks this month by the proroguing of Parliament. It was introduced by the federal government last year after an Ontario court ruled that it is unconstitutional to deny citizenship to children born in another country to Canadians also born outside Canada. The bill is meant to reverse a change by Stephen Harper’s Conservative government in 2009 that stripped children of a Canadian parent born outside Canada of their automatic right to citizenship. The Parliamentary Budget Officer last month estimated that the bill could create around 115,000 new citizens in the next five years. But now experts warn that the figure could be much higher. If the bill dies, thousands more children of Canadians born abroad, to those who have never been to Canada, would qualify for citizenship when the court ruling comes into effect in March, without added restrictions on who can be a citizen. As well as restoring citizenship rights, Bill C-71 also limits who can pass on citizenship to ensure that Canadians born abroad, who have spent their entire lives outside Canada, would not be able to automatically confer the right to a Canadian passport onto their children. They would have to show, under the bill, that they were physically in Canada for at least 1,095 days (the equivalent of three years cumulatively) before their child’s birth. Lawyer Sujit Choudhry, head of Hāki Chambers, who successfully brought the court challenge on behalf of his Lost Canadian clients, said Bill C-71 would have not only ended the second-generation cutoff but would have brought in “a substantial connection test.“ NDP immigration critic Jenny Kwan said the death of the legislation, which she said was now likely, would mean that there are no safeguards requiring links to Canada. “In my view, the substantial connections test outlined in the bill is a fair way to ensure that Lost Canadian families still have ties to Canada,” she said. “The failure to have this safeguard in place is on both the Liberals, who failed to take expeditious action to pass Bill C-71, and the Conservatives for putting up endless roadblocks to ensure Canada’s immigration laws are Charter compliant and that’s just shameful.” Renée LeBlanc Proctor, spokeswoman for Immigration Minister Marc Miller, also blamed the Conservatives for obstructing the bill “which aimed to fix their own unconstitutional amendment to the Citizenship Act.” “Conservative gamesmanship, which held the House hostage for months, sadly stalled progress on Bill C-71 since September,” she said. “Minister Miller is confident that a Liberal government would reintroduce this important bill to the House once resumed.” However, the bill is unlikely to have enough time to complete its remaining parliamentary stages before the next election. In December, 2023, Justice Jasmine Akbarali of the Ontario Superior Court struck down part of the Citizenship Act concerning Lost Canadians as unconstitutional. The ruling was originally due to come into effect on June 19, 2023. But the judge granted the federal government three extensions to give it more time to get Bill C-71 through. In December, 2024, the judge “reluctantly” granted the federal government another three months to pass the legislation. It now comes into effect on March 19, 2024, unless the government applies for and is granted a further extension. Remarking on the federal government’s lack of “legislative diligence” in December, the judge said that allowing the court ruling “to take effect without replacement legislation would cause a legislative gap that would result in an unclear and inconsistent application of citizenship law and an unknowable number of people becoming automatic Canadian citizens, some of whom may not wish to become Canadians.” Don Chapman, a Lost Canadian advocate who has been calling for decades for the law to be changed, said the Conservatives “created an unconstitutional law and need to correct it” and should offer support for legislation restoring rights for Lost Canadians, including a test of ties to Canada. He said a substantial connection test to acquire citizenship is “fair.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Woolf, Marie",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 20, 2025",Immigration policy; Federal government; Citizenship; Canadians; Legislation,,2025-01-20,The Globe and Mail
Trudeau and Poilievre should stand as one against Trump,2025.0,"Re: Canada's fight with Donald Trump isn't just economic, it's existential Stewart Prest argues that Canada should be pushing back hard on Donald Trump's constant interference in Canadian internal politics. Unfortunately, Canada's business and political elite seem unwilling to do so. They are acting like frightened schoolboys as the bully keeps taunting and threatening them. Even the putative prime minister in waiting, Pierre Poilievre, seems content to continue as the school smart-aleck, rather than acting prime ministerial. Trudeau and Poilievre would be showing real leadership if they put aside their differences for the good of the country - which they both claim to love - and stood as one against Trump's threats.

PQ leader challenges Poilievre to debate; Riled by Remarks,2025.0,"Pierre Poilievre's recent interview with Jordan Peterson was popular with a lot of people, judging by its nearly four million YouTube views. But Parti Québécois Leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon didn't like what he heard, and he's spoiling for a fight with the federal Conservative leader in what looks like a preview of what Poilievre can expect as he faces off against Quebec nationalists in an upcoming federal election. Appearing on Peterson's podcast earlier this month, Poilievre said that if the separatist PQ is comfortably leading in the polls provincially, it's because of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. After all, he said, separatists ""had been completely obliterated in the Harper era."" ""Separatism was completely dead in Quebec and now it's making a resurgence and ... the leader of the PQ has actually been making economic arguments in favour of separatism,"" Poilievre said. But because the Liberal government ""has been such a colossal disaster for our national economy, the separatists are now able to make the argument that they would be better off separating from that calamity."" For Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, known as PSPP, the remarks were too rich. He said Poilievre showed ""a contempt for Quebec in a context where the independence movement is only (perceived as) a threat."" ""That's all it comes down to. There is no will to understand. There is no will to give legitimacy to demands that are in fact identical in some respects to Canadian demands,"" he said at a Jan. 7 press conference. Poilievre always seems ready to advocate for Western Canada, St-Pierre Plamondon said. What, he demanded, would the Conservative leader, if elected prime minister, do for Quebec? ""The immediate future of Quebec in Canada, under a Pierre Poilievre government, does not bode well,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said. The two have been sparring back and forth ever since. ""I'm not here to defend the interests of one region over another. I'm here to restore Canada's promise so that everyone who works hard can earn a good living, buy an affordable home, and raise a family in a safe neighbourhood,"" Poilievre said in a social media post a few days later. The Tory leader then went on the offensive, attacking the PQ leader. ""You are afraid that a Conservative government will respect Quebec's autonomy because it would undermine your arguments in favour of sovereignty,"" he said. Quebecers, who are accustomed to being wooed by political leaders, are still waiting for Poilievre to tell them what he plans to offer their province. His predecessors had proposals specifically for Quebec, and former federal Tory leader Erin O'Toole presented a ""Quebec platform"" in the 2021 election. Stephen Harper's Conservative government even passed a motion in the House of Commons ""that Quebecers form a nation within a united Canada."" Poilievre says he believes in ""responsible federalism,"" while arguing that Harper's approach shows Quebec gets more respect from Conservatives than it has during nine years of Liberal government. As prime minister, he said, ""Quebecers will be winners."" At least some Quebecers, it seems, have yet to be convinced. ""This is an initial position, but when he talks about 'responsible federalism', it is a new expression that his Conservative predecessors did not necessarily use. He will have to clarify his thinking in relation to what this can mean concretely for Quebec,"" said Marc-André Leclerc, who was chief of staff for then Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. St-Pierre Plamondon's party won't be on the ballot in the upcoming federal election, but because it's polling as the most popular provincial party in Quebec, its leader has managed to get Poilievre's attention, and perhaps under his skin, too. He asked Poilievre if he would commit to legislating to prohibit federal spending power in areas of provincial jurisdiction, to stop challenging Quebec's controversial Bill 21 restricting religious symbols for some public employees, to give Quebec full power over immigration to the province and over cultural spending in the province.

He's also calling on the Conservatives to promise never to let an oil pipeline pass through Quebec, and to cancel any federal financial incentives to the oil and gas industry. And he wants Poilievre to vow that he'll let Quebec have a single tax return and collect revenue on behalf of both governments, something Conservatives have backed in the past.

Yet the PQ hasn't been this popular in decades - in large part because of the sinking fortunes of Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec government. It may not last. Like Poilievre, PSPP is leading a popular opposition party that's salivating for an election, scheduled in Quebec for next year. By then, they could both find themselves in very different situations, said Leclerc. ""The two will have to work together, because even for Mr. St-Pierre Plamondon, if he wins the election, there will be no referendum two weeks later. He will have no choice but to work with the federal government, and he will have no choice but to gain things,"" he said. ""And that will involve collaborating with Pierre Poilievre.""

Campbell exudes confidence:   Kraken assistant coach never doubted she'd make it to the NHL,2025.0,"You can and you will. When Seattle Kraken assistant coach Jessica Campbell pens this powerful message on various examples of memorabilia she’s been asked to sign during her first season in the NHL, it’s meant to provide inspiration in its simplest form. Campbell, who became the first woman to be hired to a full-time role on an NHL bench last summer, never doubted that she’d achieve her goals and is optimistic that many will follow in her footsteps. “For me, I’ve always had this love for the game, this passion for the game and I’ve never seen myself not in this game,” Campbell said prior to the Kraken facing the Winnipeg Jets earlier this week. “A lot of the people have asked me the questions about barriers and breaking barriers and it’s never really been about that for me. It’s more about giving myself permission that this is possible. “I always believed that I could work at the highest level of hockey and I was aspiring to do that. So now, my message to younger kids is you can do it and you will do it. Have the belief that you can and you will. Anything is possible. With that attitude, regardless of what that journey looks like, it keeps your mind on the right goals and the right aspirations and that message is something that I try to pass along to others as I’m living it out.” Campbell, 32, grew up in rural Saskatchewan and it didn’t take her long to get the hockey bug. Her passion for the sport is evident as she moves around the ice during the morning skate and during a conversation that lasts nearly 10 minutes. “I was a small-town Saskatchewan kid and just fell in love with being on the ice and skating. I was a rink rat,” said Campbell, noting her mother played for the University of Saskatchewan Huskies women’s team. “Like many Prairie kids, my journey was very similar. Hockey was part of my DNA. I was the youngest of four kids and followed in my siblings footsteps. “I never really knew what my life would have been like without hockey.” Campbell started playing boys hockey before moving over to the women’s game, where she eventually played for the Canadian national team and the Cornell Big Red of the NCAA. After retiring from the national team in 2017, Campbell shifted her focus to coaching and opened her own business, with an emphasis on power skating. In 2021, Campbell was an assistant coach for the Nürnberg Ice Tigers in the DEL and also served as an assistant coach for the German national team at the men’s world championship. Campbell spent the prior two seasons as an assistant coach with the primary affiliate of the Kraken, the Coachella Valley Firebirds, working on a staff with Dan Bylsma and for a team that made consecutive trips to the Calder Cup final in the American Hockey League. Shortly after Bylsma was hired to replace Dave Hakstol last summer, Campbell was promoted to the parent club. The familiarity of working with Bylsma and forging relationships with several players in the AHL before they made the jump to the NHL helped with Campbell’s transition to a staff that includes ample experience with fellow assistant coaches Dave Lowry and Bob Woods. “For me, it’s been a really enjoyable process,” said Campbell. “It’s all positive from my end. I’m surrounded by a lot of great people who I can learn from every day. Very smart people, very experienced people in the organization.” Campbell values the importance of communication and says Kraken players have been very receptive to her coaching. “For me, it’s all hockey talk at the end of the day,” she said. “It’s more of a change for them. It doesn’t matter about gender at the end of the day. We’re talking the language of hockey and they’ve been nothing but respectful and open.” The opportunity to be a trailblazer wasn’t something Campbell thought much about before, but she understands the responsibility that comes with it. “It’s been a journey for me as a coach, of getting to this moment and always keeping my focus on the work and the job and trying to have the best impact I can. It’s about that,” said Campbell. “But then there’s moments where you see it with fans and young kids, girls and boys, it’s a spectacle and there’s moments where the magnitude for me is definitely real. It’s something I don’t take lightly, the privilege and the responsibility that I have within my role to make a statement for others.” The TV cameras for Thursday’s broadcast captured a pair of homemade signs that paid homage to Campbell: with both young girls writing it was their first NHL game and she was the main reason they were in attendance. “That visibility is really key, so to shine light on the visibility and not pass by the opportunities to connect with fans, to share messages with younger kids and especially aspiring female coaches as well, with the same goals and aspirations,” said Campbell. “I feel great pride and responsibility that I’m able to embody that image for them and hope to see more dreams unlocked as a result.” Campbell conceded there were a few pinch-me moments during this season’s Kraken home-opener, especially since so many of the people who helped her on this odyssey made it to Seattle to share in the monumental moment. “I really tried to take in every moment. There was never going to be another first opener for me,” said Campbell. “To have key people in my life that were part of my journey, from my parents, my family to my minor (hockey) coach, my best friends and former teammates from the national team, they all flew in from across Canada and the U.S. to be there. It was a very special moment for me. “Taking in the crowd and the response as I was welcomed to Seattle, it really hit me with what it means to others. Though I’m focused on coaching and shortly after, the puck was dropped and I was in the game, it definitely empowered me more to know that as I embark on my coaching journey that I’m part of a bigger change and I’m part of growth for the game.” That growth is still in the early stages, but this is an important step in the process. “Women are in every sport. It was only a matter of time before there was one in (NHL) hockey coaching,” said Kraken forward Jaden Schwartz. “It’s awesome for the younger generation to see, to keep their goals high and keep dreaming. Anything is possible, really.” Around the glass Ovi watch Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is up to 874 NHL goals after delivering the overtime winner in a 1-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Thursday night. The latest marker moved him within 20 goals of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record. Ovechkin has 21 goals and 33 points in 29 games this season for the Capitals, who are tied with the Winnipeg Jets for first overall in the NHL in points (65) — though Washington holds two games in hand. The Jets and Capitals meet for the first of two times this season Feb. 1 in Washington, with the return match set for Mar. 25 at Canada Life Centre. Might Ovechkin be within striking distance of the record by the time the rematch rolls around? Only time will tell. Leevi Meralainen became the 179th different goalie that Ovechkin has scored on during his NHL career. Meralinen was chosen by the Senators in the third round of the 2020 NHL Draft with the pick acquired in the deal with the Winnipeg Jets for defenceman Dylan DeMelo. Hitting new heights Manitoban Keegan Kolesar established a career-high for goals with nearly half a season left to go. The Vegas Golden Knights right-winger is up to 10 goals and 19 points in 44 games while averaging 13:33 of ice time per game — which is up nearly two minutes on his career average. During a trip to Winnipeg last month, Golden Knights head coach Bruce Cassidy singled out Kolesar and fellow Manitoban Brett Howden as two players who showed up for training camp in excellent shape and ready to take on a more significant role. Kolesar, 27, is well on his way to eclipsing his career-high for points (22), which he established during the 2021-22 season. ken.wiebe@freepress.mb.ca X and Bluesky: @WiebesWorld mike.mcyintyre@freepress.mb.ca X and Bluesky: @mikemcintyrewpg Credit: Ken Wiebe Mike McIntyre","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.",Ken Wiebe Mike McIntyre,FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 18, 2025",Coaching; Careers; Professional hockey,Nom: Winnipeg Jets; NAICS: 711211,2025-01-18,Winnipeg Free Press
Poilievre launches his campaign against the ghost of Justin Trudeau,2025.0,"This week may have been the first time since Pierre Poilievre became Leader of the Conservative Party back in September of 2022, that the Ottawa discourse was focused on the Liberals for neutral – bordering on positive – reasons. Mr. Poilievre assumed the helm of the Official Opposition long after the glow that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enjoyed during those early days of the COVID-19 pandemic had faded. By then, inflation was soaring and Mr. Trudeau’s approval rating was plummeting, and it’s been a steady flow of scandal, mismanagement and turmoil ever since. The Poilievre Conservatives have managed to remain on message throughout which, we should grant, is not terribly challenging when your opponents are sticking forks in sole-sourced toasters while lecturing the public about conserving electricity. This week was a little different; notably, with the entrance of Mark Carney into the Liberal leadership race. Mr. Carney chose to effectively announce his candidacy (though he was careful not to say the words) on The Daily Show with comedian Jon Stewart three days before he actually made it official, which might have seemed like a bizarre choice until you consider the advantages conferred by a softball interview with a jovial host whose energy will rub off even on a twotime central banker. Mr. Carney did well, and people noticed. Other than declaring himself an “outsider” (indeed, that should have gotten the loudest laugh of the night), there were no major missteps: he was quick, relaxed, kept up with the banter and also still managed to utter the words “CDO-squared.” For a guy that critics have been trying to label as the second coming of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, Mr. Carney proved that he was not, in fact, the human version of yellowing wallpaper – at least on TV. His official launch, however, was dull and uninspired, and gave credence to the opinion that he might have all the flair of an aged wall covering after all. But he nevertheless conveyed an air of maturity that has been decidedly absent in the leader he seeks to replace. The Conservatives’ response was that Mr. Carney was “Just Like Justin,” which has become their tag line for each of the contenders in the race. That might work against Liberal leadership hopeful Chrystia Freeland, who was “100 per cent” supportive of her boss until roughly five minutes ago, and whose communication style is of the same sort of tedious sanctimony and recycled talking points. But Mr. Carney sounds like an actual grown-up, with a proven record on serious economic matters to boot. The Conservatives will surely put plenty of money and effort into showing Canadians how Mr. Carney and Mr. Trudeau’s policies are aligned, but the impression Mr. Carney gives off is that he and “Justin” couldn’t be more different. And impression, as the Conservatives well know, often matters more in politics than reality. Mr. Poilievre will be tempted to continue to fight the election he never got against Mr. Trudeau: to campaign against “Carbon Tax Carney” and “Carbon Tax Chrystia,” even though both have said they will scrap the carbon tax if elected. (The Conservatives may try to borrow a tactic from their political adversaries and insist the next Liberal leader harbours a carbon tax “hidden agenda,” which is just as desperate a tactic as when the Liberals do it. Surely whichever candidate is successful will provide sufficient genuine opposition fodder.) Unfortunately for the Conservatives, the past two years of only bad news for the Liberals might be coming to an end; Mr. Poilievre can adapt, or keep campaigning against the ghost of Justin Trudeau. Of course, the stakes aren’t particularly high for the Conservative Party; according to projections, it has a 50-seat buffer just to maintain its majority. Mr. Poilievre could probably dress up as a toaster with a fork in it every day until election day, and he’d still be chosen to form the next government. But the way the Conservatives choose to campaign could mean the difference between a Liberal Party sent off to languish in political oblivion for perhaps the better part of a decade, or a Liberal Official Opposition with some sway in the House of Commons and the potential for political revival after just a few years. Polling in the coming weeks, and particularly after a new Liberal leader is selected, will give some indication as to what percentage of Mr. Poilievre’s support has been from soft Liberals who were fed up with Mr. Trudeau and who felt as though they had nowhere else to park their support. At least some Canadians might find the guy who talks like an adult, even if he is dreadfully boring, unexpectedly appealing, especially if we are in an economic recession, and especially if the other guy is still slinging around sophomoric nicknames that don’t really work any more.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Urback, Robyn",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 18, 2025",Political leadership; Carbon; Political parties; Environmental tax,,2025-01-18,The Globe and Mail
What you get when politics is all about agitating others:   Byrne’s icy response to O’Toole shows how very far we have to go in national dialogue,2025.0,"Last week, Transport Minister Anita Anand announced that she would not contend for the Liberal leadership and would also not run in the next federal election. Soon after, former Conservative leader Erin O’Toole posted a note on social media paying tribute to Ms. Anand’s time as defence minister. Mr. O’Toole was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces and was once veterans affairs minister, and his comments seemed rooted in those connections. “I saw the dedication @AnitaAnandMP brought to National Defence at a time it was desperately needed. She cared deeply about the CAF, their families and the need for Canada to do more,” he wrote. “I wish her fair winds and following seas.” That’s nice, right? Gracious, mature, a welcome moment of cross-partisan respect contained in the basic decency of thanking a colleague for their service. Well, no. In marched Jenni Byrne, a political strategist with her own eponymous firm and – more relevant to this conversation – one of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s closest advisers. She reposted Mr. O’Toole’s comments and then took an axe to him. “For anyone unsure why Erin is no longer Leader of the Conservative Party,” she wrote. Ms. Anand “supported DEI policies like name, rank and pronouns. Tampons in men’s rooms, etc.” Walied Soliman, a lawyer who chaired Mr. O’Toole’s leadership campaign and the Conservative campaign during the 2021 federal election, waded in. “To all the young people involved in @CPC_HQ, and politics in Canada generally, this is exactly how not to behave in those inevitable fleeting moments when you feel you are on top,” he wrote on social media. “Be humble in leadership. Jenni, as one of our party’s current leaders, you should take this down.” You could practically hear the tires screech as Ms. Byrne shot back, “Walied, were you not the Campaign Chair for Erin that came out publicly with 5 hours left to go in the polls in 2021 to say the CPC were losing AND it was not your fault. As volunteers and candidates across the country were pulling vote after an exhausting campaign. I need no lessons in leadership from you.” Oof. Where to begin? The first thing that jumps out is how wildly unnecessary and unhinged this was. Mr. O’Toole, in political terms, does not matter right now and presents zero threat to Mr. Poilievre’s incarnation of the Tories. The former leader is working for a consulting firm, the preferred halfway house of all who leave politics. And his comment wasn’t one of those cases where someone pretends to offer praise for one person, knowing that they’ll be making an under-their-breath swipe at someone else. Mr. O’Toole was simply acknowledging that someone on another partisan team had done good work on a file he cares about. What a loser, I guess? Think about what we end up with if Canadian politics slides fully into that mood in a bar when a patron has had too much to drink and the air around them vibrates as they scan the room, begging for eye contact so they can punch someone in the face. The United States is currently in an advanced stage of this, and each week feels like another sentence in a future history textbook about how one of the world’s extinct giants toppled into the sea. Who would run for public office, for any party, if this is what it means? The best and the brightest will stay far, far away from such an asinine thunderdome. Eventually, the only people who volunteer would be spineless toadies, hyperpartisan whack jobs or anger addicts, left to run the country like a ‘roided-out island of misfit toys. Pearl-clutching over a dystopian future aside, there’s a more immediate and pragmatic problem with spite-driven politics. Ms. Byrne has a well-established reputation for sending clear messages to anyone who crosses her; a 2015 Globe profile when she was Stephen Harper’s “enforcer” wrapped entirely around that quality. And Mr. Poilievre is in his own right a skilled and enthusiastic attack dog who has never passed up a chance to finish a fight or to start one. There is that quote – “Events, my dear boy, events” – ostensibly from British prime minister Harold Macmillan when asked what was the most difficult part of running a country. The fact that Macmillan probably didn’t say this matters less than the essential underlying truth. People who have worked in high-level politics talk about how the hardest thing is to follow through on your agenda while contending with the never-ending new problems flying at you. It requires a great deal of focus, prioritizing and a very tricky bifocal vision, where you somehow keep your eye on the distant horizon and what you want to accomplish before you get there, while not letting fast-approaching objects smash through your windshield. What would make that difficult balancing act impossible is creating a whole other to-do list of fights to pick. Kicking people in the shins eats up a lot of bandwidth, and running the country – as Mr. Poilievre with Ms. Byrne at his side seems well on his way to doing – doesn’t leave you with a lot of disposable income in that regard. Donald Trump’s constant threat of economic ruin; a housing shortage both chronic and acute; feeble productivity and business investment; health care shredding at the seams; the fiscal state of the country; a potential Quebec sovereignty resurgence – the list of problems to be confronted by an incoming government is not short or lightweight. Mr. Poilievre obviously knows this; he’s spent the past few years telling Canadians that their country is broken and promising that when Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are gone, everything will get better. Judging by the polls, a great many people believe him. If they hire him for the repair job, at a certain point they’ll start to wonder whether Prime Minister Poilievre doesn’t have anything more important to do than looking around the place for a fight.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Proudfoot, Shannon",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 18, 2025",Prime ministers; Social networks; Political leadership,,2025-01-18,The Globe and Mail
We need a leader stronger than Poilievre,2025.0,"On Pierre Poilievre's recent whistle-stop tour of Vancouver Island, I kept hearing the refrain from the same old song he has been singing for the past year, Axe the Tax. While Canadians are facing a serious threat to our economy (as if it isn't bad already) from south of border, Poilievre seems to be stuck in the same groove as an old vinyl record with too many scratches on it. OK, to be just, in passing he did mention that the economy and housing is a problem. He must have picked up a newspaper on his way to Nanaimo to get that gem of information. To educate myself, I watched as many interviews with Poilievre as possible (there aren't many) and tried hard as I could to try to grab something of substance that he might accidently let slip. All I keep hearing is lots of slogans, generalizations, and a rhetoric that leaves me scratching my head. The man is not only tone deaf about the current events about to overtake our country but hasn't a clue on how he would handle Donald Trump, the economy, housing, health care. The best we can expect from this guy, who never held a job in his entire life, is to Axe the Tax. Surely, we can do better. After all, we are proud Canadians, and we need someone who will stand up to the bully south of the border without causing an all-out war with the United States.","Times - Colonist; Victoria, B.C.","Victoria, B.C.","Marinow, Alla",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 17, 2025",,,2025-01-17,Times - Colonist
"Why this small- and mid-cap money manager is buying Aritzia and a Calgary-based cannabis company:   Bruce Campbell, founder and portfolio manager at StoneCastle Investment Management, says parts of the market are overvalued, but the market can still grow into those higher valuations",2025.0,"While many investors see the market as overvalued and expect prices to drop significantly in the months ahead, money manager Bruce Campbell has a more nuanced view. “When we look at the markets, overall, we’re not looking at it from a valuation standpoint,” says the founder and portfolio manager at StoneCastle Investment Management Inc. in Kelowna, B.C., whose investing style includes technical and fundamental analysis. Mr. Campbell agrees parts of the market are overvalued, particularly some large- and mega-cap stocks, but says the market can still grow into those higher valuations. “Right now, everything we see is telling us we should be optimistic,” says Mr. Campbell, who oversees $55-million in assets. When the market eventually corrects, money can be made buying stocks at cheaper valuations, he says. And not every stock will be affected. “There will still be companies that can perform [in a down market],” Mr. Campbell says. His portfolio, which focuses on North American-based small- and mid-cap companies, has returned 3.5 per cent over the past year. Its annualized return since inception in September, 2009 is 4.7 per cent. The performance is as of Dec. 31, net of fees. The Globe spoke with Mr. Campbell recently about what he’s been buying and selling. Name three stocks you own today and why. Simply Solventless Concentrates Ltd . HASH-X, a Calgary-based cannabis company, is a stock we started to buy in late December and into January. This company has built up revenue by selling cannabis products, such as vapes and dried flower, and is generating a profit. It recently moved into the cultivation space after buying a facility from Delta 9 Cannabis Inc. out of Delta 9′s CCAA [Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act] process. The company is taking advantage of the challenging environment in the cannabis space. It’s a risky, competitive, and highly regulatory business, but we believe opportunities remain as the market morphs and moves around. Zedcor Inc . ZDC-X is a stock we’ve owned since April, 2024. The Calgary-based firm started as an oilfield services company, renting equipment such as generators and mobile office structures. It has since expanded into security and surveillance in and beyond the energy sector, including big box retailers and construction sites in Canada and the U.S. Its business is growing dramatically in the U.S. The stock has risen by more than 500 per cent over the past year. The higher valuation is a risk. It also has a lot of competition in the security and surveillance space. There’s also the potential competitive impact of artificial intelligence. Zedcor shares were under pressure mid-week after it announced financing to raise money for its U.S. expansion. Many investors were concerned the company would need to take on more debt to have the cash to ramp up the number of towers built each month. They instead raised equity. I heard that the demand for the issue was very large. When these issues happen, the stock will often come under pressure, as it did. Looking out longer-term for the stock, we believe the issue is a net positive. Aritzia Inc . ATZ-T, the Vancouver-based fashion retailer, is a stock we just started buying a few days ago. Its numbers have been strong, and it’s doing very well with its expansion into the U.S. We’ve been waiting for a pullback but it hasn’t [happened], so we’ve taken a small position. If it pulls back, we’ll add more. We owned it in the past and did well on it. The management team has done a good job growing the company in an industry in which trends come and go. The risk is that the valuation and sentiment are high, based on expectations for its expansion, so if things don’t go well that could impact the stock price. Name a stock you sold recently. Carvana Co. CVNA-N, the Tempe, Ariz.-based e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars, is a stock we started selling in November after owning it for about a year. Its business has been great, but its growth is slowing. It has gone from one of the bigger positions in our portfolio to one of the smaller ones. Hindenburg Research said in a recent report that it was shorting Carvana, which has put some pressure on the stock price. [ Editor’s note: The report accused the retailer of insider trading and accounting manipulation. Carvana called the report “ intentionally misleading and inaccurate .” ] It could be one we go back into at some point. We’re just sitting tight, watching it to decide what to do with our last little piece.

Carney and Freeland are perfect foils for Poilievre’s populism:   The response to the Liberal leadership frontrunners will make or break the Conservatives’ path to the PMO,2025.0,"There is probably no one in Canada today more qualified for the job of prime minister than Mark Carney. At 59, his life up to now has been one of awe-inspiring achievement fuelled by the pursuit of excellence in his field of specialization, central banking. His stellar reputation and real-world experience in the roller coaster global financial sector precede him. Mr. Carney’s long-time friend, and now likely principal rival for the federal Liberal Party leadership, is similarly a woman of singular accomplishment. Chrystia Freeland rode a groundbreaking career in journalism covering the fall of the Soviet Union and rise of Vladimir Putin to insinuate herself among the upper echelons of the global financial establishment before charting a meteoric political career as Canada’s first female finance minister. After nine years of Justin Trudeau, it would be refreshing to see someone with the depth of either Mr. Carney or Ms. Freeland take the reins of the Liberal Party and federal government. Yet, Mr. Carney and Ms. Freeland also happen to be near-perfect foils for the populist Pierre Poilievre, whose anti-elite crusade against Mr. Trudeau’s big-government progressivism has led the Conservative Party to near-historic heights in the polls. Though both were bred in Alberta, the top contenders for the Liberal leadership scream elitism, from their Oxford educations to their first-name-basis relationships with the Davos who’s-who. It is still unclear how much of current Tory support is simply a function of Mr. Trudeau’s unpopularity and Canadians’ desire for new leadership. Ms. Freeland would have a harder time than Mr. Carney disassociating herself from a government in which she held senior cabinet posts to credibly claim to represent a change from Mr. Trudeau. And Mr. Carney has his own explaining to do about his role as a close, if mostly informal, adviser to the current government. But Canadians might not hold that against them if they are able to articulate a forward-looking vision for the country that also addresses their bread-and-butter concerns. For now, the odds favour Mr. Poilievre. As a career parliamentarian, and an uncommonly talented one at that, he revels in the cut and thrust of political debate. Ms. Freeland is a deliberate speaker who, after more than a decade in politics, still seems more comfortable in a room of big-syllable academics than in a Legion hall. Mr. Carney is still an unknown political quantity, though he surprised many by appearing spontaneous, and even funny, in an admittedly friendly interview this week with U.S. comedy-talk-show host Jon Stewart. Debating Mr. Poilievre would not be so easy. During a 2021 exchange between the now-Conservative Leader and Mr. Carney at the House of Commons Industry committee, Mr. Poilievre managed to turn most of the former central banker’s private-sector career at Brookfield Asset Management and role as a United Nations special envoy for climate action against him. He accused Mr. Carney, whose company had then just invested billions of dollars in natural-gas pipelines in Brazil and the United Arab Emirates, of “flagrant hypocrisy” for calling Mr. Trudeau’s veto of the Northern Gateway pipeline a “sensible” move. “You support your leader’s decision to kill a Western Canadian pipeline that ships the most ethical product in the world, yet you also support your company’s decision to invest billions of dollars in foreign pipelines in Brazil and in the UAE,” Mr. Poilievre charged. “It’s clear that this is not about the environment. If it were, you’d be consistent, and you would oppose fossil fuels everywhere, but you’re happy to profit off foreign fossil-fuel companies while killing jobs among our own people.” Mr. Carney provided a reply that, while objectively unreproachable, might be a tougher sell today. “I support Canadian jobs today and tomorrow. In order to have those jobs tomorrow, what we need … is an energy transition,” he told the committee. “We collectively, as Canadians – and we look to our Parliament to support this – need to be putting in place the energies and industries of the future.” Many of the climate-related regulatory changes that Mr. Carney championed then have not withstood the political backlash against carbon pricing and the environmental, social, governance (ESG) movement. The wheels have come off the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which Mr. Carney co-chaired until Thursday, as banks and asset managers withdraw from bodies GFANZ created to encourage the voluntary disclosure of their exposure to climate-related risks and chart their progress to becoming carbon-neutral. In 2015, as Bank of England governor, Mr. Carney warned that what he called the “tragedy of the horizon” threatened the global financial system as firms focused on short-term results rather than the long-term risks of climate change to their businesses. “Once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.” In 2025, amid surging insurance claims for natural disasters, Mr. Carney’s words seem prophetic. Whether that is a political asset or a liability remains to be seen.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Yakabuski, Konrad",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 17, 2025",Banking industry; Careers; International finance; Political leadership; Populism; Climate change,,2025-01-17,The Globe and Mail
"Carney pledges to 'fight back':   Former central banker takes aim at Poilievre, and Trudeau, in launching Liberal leadership bid",2025.0,"Former central bank governor Mark Carney announced a run for Liberal leader and prime minister Thursday, promising a centrist focus on the economy and distancing himself from Justin Trudeau. Pointing to the challenges Canada will face in a changing world, Carney said he wants to lead the country in that struggle. ""I'm here to earn your trust to lead that fight. I'm back home in Edmonton to declare my candidacy for leader of the Liberal party and prime minister of Canada,"" he said. Carney is the first major contender to officially confirm he will be a candidate. The Star has confirmed former finance minister Chrystia Freeland will officially launch her campaign at an event in Toronto on Sunday. Government House leader Karina Gould will announce in her home riding of Burlington this weekend. At his launch, surrounded by supporters and several Liberal MPs, Carney promised an economic focus in his campaigns for leader and for the general election. ""We can't redistribute what we don't have, and we can't support the vulnerable in our society or defend this great country if we have a weak economy,"" he said. Carney took a dig at Trudeau when he said the prime minister didn't have a close eye on Canada's economy. Carney pledged to do it differently. ""I know I'm not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often,"" he said. ""I won't lose focus."" Along with distancing himself from Trudeau, Carney attacked Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. ""Conservatives don't run around saying Canada is broken because they want to fix it. They want a licence to demolish and destroy, including many of the things on which we all regular people depend,"" he said. ""Their three-word sound bites won't solve problems, but they will hurt regular people."" Carney is seeking the leadership of a Liberal party that is currently trailing Poilievre's Conservatives by more than 25 points in many polls. But Carney insisted he can lead the party to victory. ""The fight back starts now,"" he said. ""We are going to win the general election."" Carney has never held any elected office and did not reveal where in the country he would seek a seat. Asked if he was committed to staying leader even if he didn't win the general election, he said he would be making a commitment to the people who vote for him. ""I need to become an MP and I will be making a commitment to those constituents, to serve them, whatever happens in the election."" Carney's entrance into the race to replace Trudeau has been expected since before the prime minister announced this month his plans to step down. Trudeau's news triggered the Liberal leadership race and saw Parliament prorogued - or suspended - until March 24. Once MPs return, opposition leaders plan to bring down the government, setting the stage for a spring election. Trudeau stepped down after former finance minister Freeland's shocking resignation sparked a wave of caucus dissent. She reportedly left in part because Trudeau planned to replace her in the finance portfolio with Carney. Carney wouldn't confirm what position he was offered, but said he was being asked to join a team to confront Donald Trump's tariffs. ""In the end, the team didn't come together for reasons that we know. We still have the crisis there's still a need to stand up and I'm standing up, because of that."" Freeland confirmed she is a candidate for the Liberal leadership in an exclusive op-ed in Friday's Star. Freeland laid out how she would respond to Trump's economic threats, arguing Canada should impose dollar-for-dollar tariffs that would be precisely targeted. ""Florida orange growers, Michigan dishwasher manufacturers, and Wisconsin dairy farmers: brace yourselves,"" she wrote. ""If pushed, our response will be the single largest trade blow the U.S. economy has ever endured."" Freeland estimated those tariffs would generate $150 billion in revenue to the government per year, which could be used to help Canadians and businesses weather the economic storm. Carney, 59, was born in Fort Smith, N.W.T., but grew up in Edmonton, in the same neighbourhood where he launched his campaign and attended high school. So far, the expected challengers in the race include Carney, Freeland and government House leader Karina Gould. Ottawa backbench MP Chandra Arya has announced his plans to run, as have former Quebec MP Frank Baylis and Nova Scotia MP Jaime Battiste. Carney had previously declined multiple invitations to run as a Liberal candidate. Carney attended Harvard and Oxford universities before working as an investment banker and at the Finance Department. He was chair of Brookfield Asset Management and Bloomberg, as well as the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, and a board member of payment processor Stripe. He said he was stepping back from all of those posts to run. ""I resigned all my roles, cut all my ties. I am all in. I am all in this fight because it is so fundamentally important."" Even before he formally entered the race, Carney had attracted endorsements from Liberal MPs. ""He has the economic experience we need to stand up to Donald Trump's tariff threats and protect Canadian jobs and Canadian sovereignty,"" said Scarborough MP Salma Zahid. ""Mark is globally respected, understands the challenging geopolitical landscape, and has the economic insight to steer us through the difficulties ahead,"" said B.C. MP Patrick Weiler. Carney also received endorsements from Calgary MP George Chahal, Quebec MP Sophie Chatel, New Brunswick MP Wayne Long and Vaughan MP Francesco Sorbara. The Conservatives have been attacking Carney for months, with Poilievre dubbing him ""Carbon Tax Carney,"" and tying him closely to the Liberal government's policies. Poilievre has accused him of holding the same views as the Trudeau government. The Liberal party has clarified some of the rules for its coming leadership race. Candidates can pay the $350,000 entrance fee in instalments, with the first $50,000 due on Jan. 23 and another $50,000 due by the end of the month, with two more payments of $125,000 each due in February. The party has also set an expense limit of $5 million for each campaign, and prohibited candidates from taking on more than $200,000 in debt. The winner will be announced on March 9, two weeks before Parliament is set to resume.

PM blasts Poilievre and Smith:   Trudeau and all but one premier agree to present a united front against Trump's tariff threat,2025.0,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith for not joining a common Canadian opposition to incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's threatened tariffs, just days before a potential trade war erupts. Trudeau and 12 of 13 premiers agreed on Wednesday to form a united front and get behind a pledge that ""everything"" is on the table in Ottawa's effort to fight a potential tariff war, including restrictions on, or higher costs for, Canadian oil and gas shipped to the U.S. But Poilievre, who polls suggest could become prime minister in the next federal election, repeatedly refused Thursday to say whether Canada's energy exports should be part of a Canadian retaliatory strategy. Poilievre's dodge came after Alberta's leader broke ranks with her provincial counterparts and Trudeau and refused to support any plan that did not have a carve-out for oil and gas. Trudeau, speaking in Windsor on Thursday, said he doesn't ""blame"" Smith for advocating for her province's interests, saying it's ""important"" that all premiers do. ""But,"" he said, ""every single premier other than Danielle Smith then chose to put Canada first and say ... we're all part of Team Canada."" ""All Canadians"" stood up for Alberta when Canadian taxpayers funded the purchase of Trans Mountain pipeline expansion to ""get Albertan oil to new markets,"" Trudeau said. ""So, yes, premiers should be advocating for their own industries ... their own communities, but they should also put their country first,"" Trudeau said. The Liberal leader said he has clashed with conservative premiers like Doug Ford, Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, and Nova Scotia's Tim Houston, or with New Democrats David Eby and Wab Kinew and others. ""But when push comes to shove, every single one of them are Canadians first,"" said Trudeau. He then pivoted to say it is up to Poilievre ""to say whether he is part of Team Canada, along with all premiers and the federal government, or whether he will stand with Danielle Smith, Kevin O'Leary and, of course, Donald Trump."" Trudeau touted an outside advisory council on Canada-U.S. relations that he named on Thursday and the efforts of other business and labour leaders who are making Canada's case. Trump's proposed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian products represent a ""declaration of economic war"" on Canada, said B.C. Premier David Eby, as provinces warned of massive impacts on jobs and sectors important to the economies of their regions. But in B.C., Poilievre repeatedly refused to answer direct questions on his stance about energy exports, and his office did not reply to an emailed request from the Star. At a news conference in Delta, Poilievre said the first thing Trump should do ""is to send a big bouquet of flowers to the Liberal government in Ottawa."" ""By blocking pipelines and LNG plants in Canada, the Liberals have forced Canadians to sell almost all of our energy to the United States, giving President Trump massive leverage in making these tariffs threats."" Poilievre blasted the outgoing Trudeau - and presumptive Liberal leadership front-runners Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney - saying they ""weakened and divided our country and have given (Trump) the upper hand."" ""I will quickly approve energy projects to send our energy to the rest of the world without relying on Americans, and we will make our country more self-reliant and independent,"" Poilievre said. He repeated that answer when asked what he made of Smith's decision to bail out of the hoped-for display of unity among the country's political leaders. ""We have, effectively, 10 different foreign affairs ministers, one from each province, trying to fight separately,"" Poilievre said. At one point, Poilievre challenged a question on energy tariffs, saying he didn't understand it because ""we don't import almost any oil and gas from the Americans, at least raw oil and gas. We mostly export it."" Canada's energy regulator says the U.S. remains the top destination for Canadian crude oil, but also says the U.S. is the largest source of Canada's imported crude oil, with 72.4 per cent of Canada's oil imports originating from the U.S. that same year. In Mississauga, Ford said he is taking ""a different approach"" than Smith. ""I respect Minister (sic) Smith, but I just believe Canada comes first,"" Ford said Thursday, noting he isn't putting Ontario's auto sector or agri-food businesses ahead of the national interest and neither are most other premiers. ""So everyone has something that they're saying, 'we may have to sacrifice a little bit,' "" he said. ""I'll just leave it at ... country comes first."" Smith pushed back at her critics on X, writing: ""How about this for building a 'Team Canada' approach?"" ""Stop threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Albertans & Canadians via an energy export tax or ban."" She listed four other demands: construction of pipelines to diversify exports to Europe, Asia and domestically; more aggressive marketing of Canadian oil and gas; repeal of federal laws that Smith has long argued kill jobs and resource projects; and respect for Alberta taxpayers ""that have been transferring hundreds of billions to Quebec, the Maritimes and even Ontario, for decades."" Former central banker Carney, who declared Thursday he is running to replace Trudeau as Liberal leader and prime minister, agreed in part with Poilievre when he was asked about Smith's rejection of Trudeau's strategy. Carney said it's important to build ""the strongest economy right here in Canada"" to counter Trump. But he also stressed that, ""All of us need to stand up for Canada. We need to be united. I've done a lot of negotiation over the years. I've dealt with President Trump in a different setting, when he was previously president. He's a negotiator. He's transactional."" Carney said he, too, would take nothing off the table: ""In a negotiation you don't show your cards,"" he said. ""You don't take cards off the table. You stay united.""

Is Pierre Poilievre Canada's Donald Trump? No.,2025.0,"The election of an unpredictable, autocratic, conservative Donald Trump threatening to annex Canada is alarming to most Canadians. The question for Canadians is what would happen under a Conservative Pierre Poilievre administration that might mimic the policies unfolding south of the border. Poilievre’s pre-election campaign has a Trump-like conspiratorial tone courting the anti-vaccine, climate-change-denial, anti-trans crowds and for good measure, anti-rich/elites. For proof of his sincerity, Poilievre tells us neither he nor any of his staff will be attending the Davos annual meetings of the World Economic Forum, an organization funded by its 1,000-member multinational corporations. Like-minded politicians are invited to the annual meeting. Poilievre’s former boss — former prime minister Stephen Harper — has been a guest and speaker at the conference, preaching to the converted promoting conservative economics policy. The question remains how Poilievre will differentiate himself from the attendees other than as an anti-elitist election ploy. Once in office, the evidence suggests a Poilievre government could turn out to be culturally rather benign and economically radically neoliberal, much like post-1980, pre-Trump U.S. Republican presidents. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush used racism to court the so-called white working class while acting as pitchmen for the corporate rich who prospered with tax cuts, deregulation, free trade and anti-union labour market policies with the resulting remarkable increase in U.S. inequality. Tariffs, along with rounding up and exporting immigrants, is bad for business and would likely not be on Poilievre’s agenda. Like Reagan and Bush, Poilievre is using the culture war to attract popular support for a party whose prime interest is to defend wealth inequality, in this case in the form of a petrostate. He and his wife Ana identify as “pro-choice.” While he visits Christian fundamentalist churches, he also shows up at mosques. He is just a conventional Canadian conservative who will introduce tax cuts for the rich, cuts to social spending, deregulation and free trade. Poilievre voted against environmental protection 400 times and identifies efforts to regulate the environmental as “government controlling our lives” and an assault on “our freedom and prosperity.” The one thing his government will do is support the building of pipelines in Canada: “south, north, east, and west.” While he claims to be representing the interests of the “working class” against “elites” like “politicians and bankers,” according to PressProgress, Poilievre — when serving as Harper’s jobs minister — pushed hard for U.S.-style anti-union “right to work” laws. Unions increase wages for themselves and others and defend the Canadian welfare system. His trade policy is free market, putting Canadian workers in competition with low-wage workers in developing countries. It is clear that he will end the Liberal/NDP tentative plan for a single-payer system for pharmaceuticals, complaining that it is inferior to the private plan that Canadians cherish. The fact is that all the sectors in the Canadian health-care system under the single payer system have been remarkably more effective at cost controls and equitable access than those still dominated by the for-profit private sector. Katrina Miller, the executive director of Canadians for Tax Fairness, identifies Poilievre’s anti-tax agenda as rooted in a fundamentally false narrative. He claims government collects too many taxes, spend the money poorly and we get inflation. The truth is taxes for middle to low-income Canadians are about the same rate as it was in Harper’s time. Poilievre wants to eliminate the carbon tax because of the burden it has on working families. The problem with this argument is that 80 per cent of Canadian families will get back more in rebates than they pay. Gas taxes are used to fund public infrastructure. The payroll taxes he wants to cut pay for the services that working families and seniors depend on for their quality of life. He will not follow through on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s plan to increase capital gains taxes. This kind of tax has served to enrich the top one per cent of Canadians without evidence of contributions to investment or growth. The Financial Post headline from March 13, 2013 reads ‘ Not much bang for the buck’: Harper’s $60-B corporate tax cuts under fire . According to the parliamentary budget office, the top one per cent of Canadian households hold a quarter of all the wealth, while the bottom 40 per cent hold about one per cent. Instead of antidemocratic chaos, Canadian institutions under Poilievre would be redirected away from social democracy and a government that takes responsibility for citizens economic welfare and environmental health and towards one that leaves them to their fate in the marketplace, resulting in inequality and a decline in their life chances. Like his predecessor Harper, he’s not an anti-establishment figure but one happy to serve its upper class. And like Harper, he would likely keep the socially conservative issues that might offend too many Canadians off the agenda in order to serve mammon.

"Letters: Trudeau, Poilievre duck real interviews with tough questions",2025.0,"In a typical example of politicians avoiding any difficult questions, Trudeau gave his year-end interview to Mark Critch, a CBC comedian, and Poilievre was interviewed on a podcast by Jordan Peterson. The days of political leaders having press conferences where their assertions might be challenged, seem to be over. Do we really want free speech to be defined by Elon Musk's X algorithm, Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook clickbait and editorial interference by newspaper owners like Jeff Bezos? ""You get what you pay for"" has long been a maxim that indicates that cheap means poor quality and ""no free lunch"" suggests that there is always a cost. What are people getting for free media? Freedom to avoid subscriptions as independent newspapers die across the country, and freedom from thinking about any viewpoints other than those expressed in their favourite social media sources. The cost? Disappearance of objective news and the loss of privacy, exemplified by Apple using Siri to listen in on living-room conversations. David Steele, Saskatoon Americans could adopt King Charles instead Murray Mandryk's column in the Friday, Jan. 10 edition got me thinking about Trump, Canada and related issues. I am sure that Mr Trump is very pleased with the impact that his stream-of-consciousness rambling has induced. Here are a few issues he might consider. The line on the map is indeed an arbitrary division negotiated a long time ago. Those of us who live on the Prairies know how little changes when we cross it, but he might want to consider the implications of its erasure. Negotiations similar to the goodwill ones that established the border line might lead to the Canadian provinces joining the ""Great Republic"" not as one state but based on population and area as about five states, each with two senators and a proportionate number of representatives. Of these states four (the ones who normally support the Liberal Party) would consistently vote Democrat. Another option is that incoming president Trump, who is half Scottish, and I believe is already entitled to a U.K. passport, could mend the error of 1776 (which was a much closer result than people remember) and swear allegiance to King Charles III on behalf of the American people. Then we could get together and sort out a new and greater British North America. Stuart Middleton, Saskatoon Canadian leaders need to show unity The response of our political leaders to the threats from incoming president Trump have been less than inspiring. Our political leaders, all of them, need to stop sowing divisiveness and show real leadership through unity. Particularly, stop the whining about how broken the country is and how much we need an election. Why not speak about the strengths of this country, how much better we did during the pandemic than a Trump-administered USA, how our culture values tolerance and understanding rather than authoritarianism? At least Doug Ford and, to a lesser extent David Eby, are setting an example and showing leadership. All our leaders, political, business and industry, can do this and stand up for their country.

Chris Gardner: Only one man can fix Canada - Pierre Poilievre,2025.0,"If you feel as though Canada is broken, you are not alone. Last year, a Leger poll found that 70 per cent of Canadians believe ""everything is broken in the country right now."" The social contract Canadians thought was in place - work hard, pay your fair share of taxes, buy a home, raise a family - is broken. It's becoming so difficult and expensive to support families and communities that widespread disenchantment, despondency and even discord is taking hold. At the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association (ICBA), we talk a lot about the hard work that construction professionals do to build our communities. We also celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit and risk-taking that is at the centre of every contracting business. Construction workers will tell you that the longer you ignore problems on a job site, the worse they become. And in Canada, the Trudeau government has ignored too many problems for far too long. That's why ICBA, Canada's largest construction association, has endorsed Pierre Poilievre and his commonsense Conservatives. There was a time when Canada was a nation of proud builders. No project was too big for the ambitions of a young country seeking to assert its place in the world. We built ports, pipelines, hydroelectric dams, mines, the St. Lawrence Seaway, roads, bridges and houses. We didn't just build with purpose - we built things fast. Sadly, those days are long gone. It took us over a decade to twin an existing pipeline from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C., and by the time we end up replacing the George Massey Tunnel on British Columbia's Highway 99, one of the busiest transportation corridors in Canada, it will have been a nearly 30-year endeavour. Virtually every major infrastructure project undertaken in Canada today is over budget and overdue. The cost overruns are in the billions and delays are measured in years and even decades. And we are failing to renew our aging infrastructure. In 2024, we had major infrastructure failures in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. For most Canadians, the inability to build reveals itself most sharply in the lack of affordable housing. We are building about the same number of homes in Canada today as we did in 1972, two generations ago. Overregulation, red tape, taxes and fees have added costs and slowed building to the point where there is little prospect of supply catching up to demand, which is the key to bringing housing markets back into balance. Meanwhile, our cities are being overwhelmed by levels of immigration that we simply cannot absorb. We're also getting poorer. The Fraser Institute recently compared median wages in Canadian provinces and U.S. states. All 10 provinces ranked at the bottom of the list, meaning that the average worker in every single U.S. state earns higher wages than their counterparts in every Canadian province. National Bank reports that since 2018, 15 of 18 manufacturing industries in Canada have experienced negative growth, while the sector as a whole shrunk by five per cent. That translates into businesses closing, lost investment and smaller paycheques. As the Liberals sat on its hands, unmoved by the smaller paycheques of workers and Canada's sharp economic decline, one area they succeeded in growing beyond every expectation has been government itself. Since Justin Trudeau became prime minister, the federal workforce has expanded by an eye-watering 43 per cent, and the government's appetite for new programs and deficit spending knows no limits. The most blatant example of the disconnect between a government that is out of touch with the daily struggles of Canadians is the carbon tax. It continues to ratchet up, punishing Canadians who are struggling to pay for rent, mortgages, gas and groceries. Other policy failures include our collapsing health-care system, which now has a median wait time of 30 weeks to get treatment after being referred by a GP, and increased street crime, due to Ottawa's experiment with legalizing the possession of hard drugs and its catch-and-release bail policies. As a nation, the Trudeau government has made us less bold, less determined, less certain and less ambitious. So, yes, a large majority of Canadians rightly feel that the country is broken. We are in desperate need of renewal in Canada, with a prime minister who has fresh ideas, a commonsense approach to charting a path to prosperity and who governs with a focus on making paycheques go further, communities safer and government less pervasive. Pierre Poilievre is that leader, and the best opportunity for Canada to once again live up to its potential.

"Carney staked out ground but his first day didn’t dazzle:   It’s no surprise that the former central banker is running on economic management, but his launch made it clear that he intends to lean heavily into Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s central issue",2025.0,"There were going to be hockey clichés. Mark Carney launched his campaign for the Liberal leadership in an Edmonton hockey arena. He talked about leading Liberals to a third-period comeback. But somebody should have given the starting centre a shake. Mr. Carney had a slow start. There were the usual trappings for a rah-rah event – a giant big flag, a bunch of ordinary folks as the backdrop. But Mr. Carney didn’t pump energy into the place. He spoke slowly, pausing, in a listless cadence that poured out like molasses, and even slower in French. It looked like his teleprompter might have gone on the fritz, as he kept glancing at his papers. That’s all superficial vibes stuff, of course, and in his speech, the former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor spoke about making politics about more than slogans and soundbites. But the launch, and the speech itself, was mostly about vibes. It was a day to paint a picture of Mr. Carney, the kid who grew up playing up hockey in Edmonton and grew into someone with extensive economic experience who has a serious plan to deal with the country’s economic challenges. This was Mr. Carney’s first day in electoral politics, and the question many Liberals were asking about the candidate with the impressive résumé was how he’d perform as a politician. He didn’t dazzle. But he didn’t flop. He was more lively in the less-scripted answers during a postspeech press conference, including fending off questions about potential conflicts of interest by declaring he has resigned from all his corporate posts. What he didn’t do was make a splash with a trenchant position on the hot opening issues of the campaign. The unofficial campaign of former finance minister Chrystia Freeland had let it be known that she will propose killing the consumer carbon tax, but Mr. Carney wasn’t quite so clear – saying that eliminating the levy would require replacing it, and he would reveal his plan in coming weeks. And for those Liberals judging his bilingualism, he answered queries in a bureaucrat’s French: He was able to speak about climate change with a proper policy vocabulary but struggled to communicate to a reporter to stay tuned for a plan to come in a few weeks. Yet the speech Mr. Carney delivered in Edmonton allowed him to set out a few basic markers to distance himself from Justin Trudeau, and to declare himself to be the economy candidate – and argue he is the best person to face Donald Trump’s tariff threats. His pointed criticism of Mr. Trudeau’s economic management of a government that “spends too much but invests too little,” was both an effort to signal that he represents change and a shot at Ms. Freeland. “I know I’m not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the Prime Minister and his team wander from the economy too often,” Mr. Carney said. “I won’t lose focus.” It’s no surprise that the former central banker is running on economic management, but his launch made it clear that he intends to lean heavily into the issue that has become the Liberal government’s biggest weakness – and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s central issue. Mr. Carney’s speech made many of the same points Mr. Poilievre might make – that growth is too slow, wages are too low, groceries and rent are too expensive and middle-class taxes are too high – but he insisted he would offer “bold” ideas to fix them, while the Conservative Leader deals in “slogans and soundbites.” “Let me tell you one other thing in these times, sending Pierre Poilievre to negotiate with Donald Trump is the worst possible idea I can think of,” he said. It was, on paper, a leadership-launch message to position Mr. Carney as the non-Trudeau Liberal for troubling times. But it was also supposed to be the script for the political performance many Liberals were really tuning in to see: They wanted to judge the central banker’s political chops. They didn’t need to be persuaded by Mr. Carney’s seriousness, or his acumen. They’d want to see if he’s likely to win over a crowd. And on his first day, his performance didn’t have that energy.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Campbell, Clark",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 16, 2025",Political campaigns; Leadership,,2025-01-16,The Globe and Mail
Pierre Poilievre launches his campaign against the ghost of Justin Trudeau:   Will the entrance of Mark Carney into the Liberal leadership race force the Conservatives to adopt a new approach?,2025.0,"This week may have been the first time since Pierre Poilievre became leader of the Conservative Party back in September of 2022, that the Ottawa discourse was focused on the Liberals for neutral – bordering on positive – reasons. Mr. Poilievre assumed the helm of the Official Opposition long after the glow that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enjoyed during those early days of the COVID-19 pandemic had faded. By then, inflation was soaring and Mr. Trudeau’s approval rating was plummeting, and it’s been a steady flow of scandal, mismanagement and turmoil ever since. The Poilievre Conservatives have managed to remain on message throughout which, we should grant, is not terribly challenging when your opponents are sticking forks in sole-sourced toasters while lecturing the public about conserving electricity. This week was a little different; notably, with the entrance of Mark Carney into the Liberal leadership race. Mr. Carney chose to effectively announce his candidacy (though he was careful not to say the words) on The Daily Show with comedian Jon Stewart three days before he actually made it official, which might have seemed like a bizarre choice until you consider the advantages conferred by a softball interview with a jovial host whose energy will rub off even on a two-time central banker. Mr. Carney did well, and people noticed. Other than declaring himself an “outsider” (indeed, that should have gotten the loudest laugh of the night), there were no major missteps: he was quick, relaxed, kept up with the banter and also still managed to utter the words “CDO-squared.” For a guy that critics have been trying to label as the second coming of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, Mr. Carney proved that he was not, in fact, the human version of yellowing wallpaper – at least on TV. His official launch, however, was dull and uninspired, and gave credence to the opinion that he might have all the flair of an aged wall covering after all. But he nevertheless conveyed an air of maturity that has been decidedly absent in the leader he seeks to replace. The Conservatives’ response was that Mr. Carney was “Just Like Justin,” which has become their tag line for each of the contenders in the race. That might work against Liberal leadership hopeful Chrystia Freeland, who was “100 per cent” supportive of her boss until roughly five minutes ago, and whose communication style is of the same sort of tedious sanctimony and recycled talking points. But Mr. Carney sounds like an actual grown-up, with a proven record on serious economic matters to boot. The Conservatives will surely put plenty of money and effort into showing Canadians how Mr. Carney and Mr. Trudeau’s policies are aligned, but the impression Mr. Carney gives off is that he and “Justin” couldn’t be more different. And impression, as the Conservatives well know, often matters more in politics than reality. Mr. Poilievre will be tempted to continue to fight the election he never got against Mr. Trudeau: to campaign against “Carbon Tax Carney” and “Carbon Tax Chrystia,” even though both have said they will scrap the carbon tax if elected. (The Conservatives may try to borrow a tactic from their political adversaries and insist the next Liberal leader harbours a carbon tax “hidden agenda,” which is just as desperate a tactic as when the Liberals do it. Surely whichever candidate is successful will provide sufficient genuine opposition fodder.) Unfortunately for the Conservatives, the past two years of only bad news for the Liberals might be coming to an end; Mr. Poilievre can adapt, or keep campaigning against the ghost of Justin Trudeau. Of course, the stakes aren’t particularly high for the Conservative Party; according to projections, it has a 50-seat buffer just to maintain its majority. Mr. Poilievre could probably dress up as a toaster with a fork in it every day until election day, and he’d still be chosen to form the next government. But the way the Conservatives choose to campaign could mean the difference between a Liberal Party sent off to languish in political oblivion for perhaps the better part of a decade, or a Liberal Official Opposition with some sway in the House of Commons and the potential for political revival after just a few years. Polling in the coming weeks, and particularly after a new Liberal leader is selected, will give some indication as to what percentage of Mr. Poilievre’s support has been from soft Liberals who were fed up with Mr. Trudeau and who felt as though they had nowhere else to park their support. At least some Canadians might find the guy who talks like an adult, even if he is dreadfully boring, unexpectedly appealing, especially if we are in an economic recession, and especially if the other guy is still slinging around sophomoric nicknames that don’t really work any more.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Urback, Robyn",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 16, 2025",Political leadership; Carbon; Political parties; Environmental tax,,2025-01-16,The Globe and Mail
"Poilievre, Carney and their interviewers",2025.0,"The race to lead the country is on, and we do need leadership, it's true. Canada is mired in a housing crisis, an opioid crisis, the climate crisis and the Trump crisis, which could swamp them all. Trump's fall-of-the-Roman-empire-style madness could, frankly, swamp everything. So it's the season of friendly, soft-focus interviews. Last week, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre sat down with conservative influencer Jordan Peterson, who was last seen posing with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and Canada-U.S. merger enthusiast Kevin O'Leary at Mar-a-Lago. Monday night, former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney sat down with liberal icon Jon Stewart on ""The Daily Show,"" who was last seen ... uh, hosting ""The Daily Show."" Both would-be PMs were going for vibes, because in a world where information pollution and information scarcity are both somehow endemic, vibes are politics. Poilievre chose the outlet with the greater reach; Carney chose the American outlet that middle-aged Canadian liberals are more likely to be excited about. Former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, who is said to not be a favourite of caucus, is expected to declare some time before Trump's inauguration on Monday; given her lack of skill as a retail politician, she should choose her opening number carefully. But beyond vibes lie plans, and that should be how Canada views potential PMs, because what's going to make your life better: vibes, or policies? Carney, for his part, hasn't offered much in terms of plans; he hasn't even officially declared yet. But he is clearly an institutionalist, and likely a financially conservative and socially liberal politician. He understands crises: he helped navigate Canada (and, uh, Ireland) through the 2008 financial crisis, and was governor of the Bank of England when that country's reckless vandals handed him Brexit, and the Brits still haven't recovered. And with Stewart, Carney was short on policy, but at least correctly analyzed problems. Yes, insurance companies will pull policies due to climate change risks whether you personally believe in man-made climate change or not; yes, Canada has indeed lost control of housing, which, combined with the effects of inflation, makes many people feel like they are falling behind. Carney also said, ""truth be told, the (Trudeau) government has not been as focused on those issues as it could be,"" and said that was what the coming election will be about. In those 19 minutes, Carney came across as genial, capable, charming. Stewart conferred a decent amount of that charm, sure, but there appeared to be a human being in Carney's suit rather than a starched Laurentian banker, and Carney didn't sound much like Justin Trudeau. So mission accomplished, presumably. Poilievre's appearance with Peterson - nearly two hours long - featured a similarly comfortable Poilievre discussing his vision of Canada. And stripped down, it seems to amount to a more radical version of free-market Reform-style libertarianism with a new coat of paint. Slash regulations, slash taxes, slash spending and therefore services, and crack down further on bail (and presumably wind up back at the Supreme Court). Oh, and a decent enough housing plan, though flawed, too. Poilievre is resolute in his beliefs, probably because he grew up in the church of western Canadian conservatism, and has been part of the rightward drift of the Conservative Party of Canada. Being a right-wing attack dog is almost all he's ever done, and perhaps the most revealing part of the Peterson interview was when Poilievre said he used some of the language from an essay on freedom he wrote at age 20 in his leadership launch speech. Maybe that's why no matter the crisis - a pandemic, or Trump - his solution includes tax cuts. Really, it was Poilievre's analysis of the problems that was probably the most worrisome part. The bizarre idea, introduced by Peterson and agreed to by Poilievre, that wokeism had introduced racism to Canada and was responsible for a rise in hate crime, which a 2024 RCMP report noted began in 2016, and, ""coincided with the rise of populist politics and inflammatory rhetoric directed toward immigrant, racialized, and religious minority groups."" The strange assertion that Trudeau's government was radical, authoritarian socialism, which you only believe if you're fairly far to the right. The aspirational assessment that the way young people have switched to Conservatives because they believe in their ideas and comportment, rather than not being able to afford to rent an apartment or buy as many groceries. Sure, maybe. But for now, maybe the biggest gap between these two can be found in their chosen interviewers. Stewart is funny, and has real humane principles: one of his notable achievements was fighting for health benefits for 9/11 first responders. Peterson is a spitting cobra who thinks the pandemic and climate change are both fake, among other real things. In the race to lead Canada, these were the respective safe spaces of the leader of the federal Conservatives, and the possible front-runner for the Liberals. One of those spaces should make people feel something closer to safe.

"Poilievre pledges to roll back capital gains tax hike, retaliate against Trump tariffs:   The Conservative Party leader tells The Globe and Mail Canada must respond with tariffs of it s own to counter Trump’s promise to levy 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian goods",2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will soon lay out his own strategy to confront U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada as part of a broader economic agenda that, if he becomes prime minister, will include a promise to roll back the capital-gains tax increase. Mr. Poilievre told The Globe and Mail in an interview that he believes Canada must respond with tariffs of its own to counter Mr. Trump’s promise that he’ll levy 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian goods. “The Canadian government must retaliate with highly targeted tariffs against American goods coming into Canada. That I can say right now,” he said. A meeting involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and provincial leaders ended Wednesday with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith refusing to sign off on a joint statement on Canada’s response plan. She blamed Ottawa’s unwillingness to rule out export levies or restrictions on energy exports as part of possible retaliatory measures. The premiers are also calling on Ottawa to prepare a bailout package for affected sectors. When asked for his thoughts on both issues, Mr. Poilievre said he had no specific announcements to make – yet. “Over the next couple of weeks, I’ll be laying out more of my agenda and my strategy to confront President Trump’s unjust threat against the Canadian economy,” he said. But, he told The Globe that he made the decision to announce his promise to rollback the capital gains tax increase this week because of Mr. Trump’s manoeuvring. Then-finance minister Chrystia Freeland announced changes to the capital-gains tax regime in the past federal budget, raising the portion of gains subject to income tax. She framed the move as an effort at generational fairness, but it met with pushback from small businesses and entrepreneurs who said it unfairly punished them. The opposition Conservatives voted against the increase, but Mr. Poilievre had yet to say directly that he would repeal it. Mr. Poilievre said he was concerned that if investors didn’t know for certain that the tax increase would be cancelled should he form government, Canada could lose billions of dollars in investments. “With President Trump potentially imposing tariffs within weeks, that is absolutely unacceptable and reckless,” he said. “So I wanted to signal to the market now that they should not pull the money out of Canada.” Polls currently suggest Mr. Poilievre’s Conservatives will form government in the next election. While that’s not scheduled until October, 2025. Mr. Trudeau’s decision to prorogue Parliament and announce that he’ll resign as leader upon the election of his replacement, however, has sped up the likelihood Canadians will go to the polls as early as this spring. Ms. Freeland is expected to be among the leadership contenders. The Globe has previously reported that she may renounce the capital-gains changes as part of her efforts to distinguish herself from Mr. Trudeau. She quit as finance minister on Dec. 16. Mr. Poilievre said he also waited to announce that he would commit to a rollback because he wanted to cost out the implications of doing that against the new measures he wants to promise to Canadians. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated that the changes would bring in about $17.4-billion over five years for government – money the Liberals and provincial governments were counting on. However, the legislation required to make the changes died when Mr. Trudeau prorogued Parliament, creating uncertainty as to whether the move – which the Canada Revenue Agency is already implementing – is in fact going to go ahead. Mr. Poilievre said that he intends to put forward a costed platform in the next election, and will not promise any new measures that will increase the deficit, currently pegged at $61.9-billion for the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2024. “So I wasn’t about to make a commitment until I was sure that I had a costed plan to bring down the deficit while eliminating this tax increase, and I have now done that homework,” he said.

John Ivison: How Carney plans to win the Liberal leadership and hold Poilievre to a minority,2025.0,"The Liberal party has unravelled in two ways: gradually, then remarkably suddenly. The received wisdom is now obsolete by the time it has been received. So far, none of the contenders touted to replace Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader and prime minister have come forward. That will change Thursday with the announcement in Edmonton by Mark Carney that he will reluctantly offer himself to the service of his country. The former bank governor is likely to be self-effacing about his stated ambition but, in truth, he sees politics as a remedy for decades of frustration where, as he says in his book Value(s), he ""could see much but do relatively little."" The truth is many, many Liberals are saying that if Carney isn't the new leader by late March, the party will be able to hold its next convention in a bus shelter. (Disclaimer: I am a family friend of the Carneys, but retweets are not endorsements. I remain a firm adherent of Mark Twain's maxim: ""Loyalty to country, ALWAYS. Loyalty to government, when it deserves it."") Carney's appearance on Jon Stewart's Daily Show this week has ignited hope that the furniture can be saved under his leadership. Stewart had apparently read Value(s), and was keen to have him as a guest. In the event, it appeared the host was more interested in lining up his next wisecrack than listening to what Carney had to say, but it provided the former governor with a platform to show a more playful side to his character. Carney registered at least one genuine chuckle, when he talked about Canada's antipathy to a closer relationship with the U.S. ""It's not you, it's us,"" he said. He hinted at his leadership campaign strategy when Stewart suggested it will be difficult for any Liberal candidate, given they will be saddled with Justin Trudeau's policies. Carney pushed back, touting the chances of a hypothetical candidate who had not been part of the government; who had plenty of economic experience; and, who had a plan to deal with the challenges ahead. ""You're running as an outsider?"" asked Stewart. ""I am an outsider,"" said Carney. The online onslaught has already started. Canada Proud is running an ad portraying Carney as an out-of-touch elitist: a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, an adviser to Trudeau and a member of the World Economic Forum. Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney and The Daily Show host Jon Stewart on Jan. 13. Carney will try to convince Canadians that such broad experience is a positive. With the threat of Donald Trump's tariffs looming, it may not hurt to remind voters that he has experience in international crisis management. After all, in October 2008, Carney and the late Conservative finance minister Jim Flaherty were in the U.S. Treasury Cash Room with other G7 finance ministers and central bankers when the consensus was reached to backstop the banking system with liquidity to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression. The momentum gathering behind him is such that there is speculation Chrystia Freeland, his presumed closest contender, may decide not to run after all. Many Liberals believe the time is long overdue for their party to return to its traditional position straddling the centre of the political spectrum and that is where Carney would take them. Francesco Sorbara is one of a growing number of Liberal MPs who are publicly proclaiming their support for Carney. In a statement on X, he said Canada needs ""experienced, decisive and ambitious"" leadership and it is imperative for ""centrist Liberals ... to grasp the seriousness of the moment."" The Canadian political landscape is changing in other ways. It appears we are not going to have a ""carbon tax election,"" as Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been suggesting. If Carney wins, he will kill the consumer carbon tax. He said as much in an appearance at the Senate banking committee last year, when he said, ""it has served a purpose up until now"". He reiterated his position on the Daily Show, when he said Canada has to ""do our bit (on fighting climate change) but in a way that Canadians today are not paying the price."" Carney's position, repeated in various speeches, is that the world needs low-risk, low-cost and low-emission energy as it transitions from fossil fuels. Carney believes Canada has low-risk and relatively low-cost oil but needs to do more work on the emissions side through technology like the Pathways Alliance carbon capture and storage project While he does not support a cap on fossil fuel production, he is committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 (as are the 50 oil and gas companies who signed the decarbonization charter at COP28 in Dubai in 2023). Yet, he remains a proponent of ESG (environment, social and governance) investing that has become an anathema to many people. John Ivison: Bureaucrats try stopping Trudeau from going out in a spending spree John Ivison: Trudeau left Canadians feeling like strangers in their own land And he is certainly not as enthusiastic in his support of Alberta's oil and gas industry as is Poilievre, who is specifically proposing to build energy infrastructure like LNG plants, pipelines and refineries Carney's launch in Edmonton is symbolic because he grew up in Laurier Heights, in what is part of the Edmonton Centre riding. It is the city where his father once ran for the Liberals. But it does not mean he is committed to running in a province that has not been fertile ground for the Liberal party. Conservatives have already pivoted from talking about ""Carbon tax Carney"" to attacking him as ""a man with Trudeau's politics and (Michael) Ignatieff's personality."" ""Not an outsider. Not change. He's just like Justin,"" ran one online attack That is going to be a challenge for Carney when it (or a variation of it) is the subject of a multi-million-dollar ad spend. But the idea that Carney has offered unwavering support for Trudeau's agenda is not quite right. He told Stewart that ""the (Trudeau) government has not been as focused on those issues (housing and the cost of living) as it might have been"". While the current prime minister admitted he doesn't give much thought to monetary policy during the 2021 election, and has often been more focused on redistribution than economic growth, Carney has been touting a very different public policy path. Post-pandemic, he talked about economies being brought back into balance, with tests of debt servicing costs to revenue used so that the government of the day is not seduced by low interest rates. In a speech last year, Carney talked about a ""hinge"" moment in history, with three possible responses: the first that was being followed by the Trudeau government of ""spend, support, subsidize""; the second, which he suggested was being proposed by Poilievre, of ""demolish, destroy, deny""; and a third, which he advocated, of using public money to catalyze private investment. He has called for a new era of fiscal discipline and a focus on improving long-term productive capacity, rather than ""reflex"" spending to treat the symptoms but not the disease. We are likely to hear variations of this speech, with some specifics on his ""build, build, build"" theme, along with echoes of the criticism levelled by Ignatieff at Stéphane Dion during the 2006 party leadership campaign that former Liberal governments ""didn't get it done."" Carney's biggest challenge is going to be how to convince everyday Canadians that he is in it for them, not himself, and that his policies will offer them some relief. One intriguing comment he made to Stewart was that the timing of the next election ""will likely be the choice of the governing party."" That suggests another difference with Trudeau if Carney is elected Liberal leader: He is not going to grub around seeking a deal with the NDP's Jagmeet Singh. If the Liberals are going off a cliff, Carney is going to be in the driver's seat, with this foot on the accelerator. It is a good bet that he will soon at least briefly be Canada's next prime minister, and that the polls will start to narrow as we move into a general election. Realistically, his best hope is to hold the Conservatives to a minority government. The Liberal brand is probably too toxic for any Lazarus-like resurrection. But a minority Poilievre government would offer the prospect of a rematch within a year or two. The alternative to running now would have been to try to rebuild the smouldering ashes of the Liberal party after a historic loss. Carney himself remains a work in progress as a politician. Apparently, he did not appreciate the irony when he accused Poilievre of ""seeing opportunity in tragedy"" on the Daily Show, just before invoking the California wildfires as a justification for climate action. But for many Liberals, he represents a feeling that they had forsaken: hope. Take all of the above for what it's worth. It is the received wisdom and it may well be out of date by the time you read this. jivison@criffel.ca( mailto:jivison@criffel.ca ) Get more deep-dive National Post political coverage and analysis in your inbox with the Political Hack newsletter, where Ottawa bureau chief Stuart Thomson and political analyst Tasha Kheiriddin get at what's really going on behind the scenes on Parliament Hill every Wednesday and Friday, exclusively for subscribers.

"FIRST READING: Harper unloads on Trudeau, Trump in uncharacteristic interview",2025.0,"TOP STORY In his most explicit critique of his successor to date, former prime minister Stephen Harper said the government of Justin Trudeau has failed on basically every possible metric and has ""denigrated"" the country. ""All of the results of that government are bad; I mean virtually everything has been bad,"" Harper told Florida-based podcaster Gabe Groisman this week On economics, Harper said ""the damage is undeniable,"" and he also accused Trudeau of pursuing a ""woke agenda that has really denigrated the country's culture and history and institutions."" ""I think Canadians have reacted more strongly against that than even the economic results,"" said Harper. Harper has made fewer than half-a-dozen media appearances since stepping down as prime minister in 2015 - almost all of them on U.S. conservative podcasts. In 2018, Harper sat down for an hour with U.S. conservative broadcaster Ben Shapiro. In 2021, he was a featured guest on the podcast American Optimist hosted by tech investor Joe Lonsdale (who had hired Harper as a consultant). In both of those, Harper delivered only veiled criticisms of the Trudeau government, saying he made it a point to avoid weighing in on the actions of his ""successor government."" In Harper's 2021 interview with Lonsdale, he said only that Canada's procurement of COVID vaccines would have happened much earlier under a Conservative government. ""When we were in government, we never had any problem making sure we had vaccines well in advance,"" he said. Even in a 2023 keynote appearance at the Canada Strong & Free Conference, Harper's only real critique of the Trudeau government was to say that it was on a ""pretty poor course."" But Harper's interview with Groisman was different. Right off the top, he accused Trudeau of misrepresenting himself as a centrist in the 2015 election that ousted Harper from power. ""He didn't run as a far leftist; (he) tried to convince everybody that all the things they liked about our government would be maintained and a few things would be changed,"" Harper said, adding ""of course, the government then went to the far left almost immediately."" He said Trudeau was never a particularly skilled politician, but clung to power thanks to a ""media conglomerate"" that ""erased his every error"" and ""misrepresented his opposition."" ""It was literally propaganda ... and that's not going to be good enough anymore,"" he said. Clark and Champagne bow out of Liberal leadership race, as Gould prepares to launch John Ivison: Bureaucrats try stopping Trudeau from going out in a spending blaze of glory When Groisman asked if Trudeau's downfall was a symptom of a global populist shift against left-wing incumbents, Harper said Canadians were turning on Trudeau for very specific reasons, rather than any kind of generalized distaste for progressivism. Harper expressed his belief that ""governments defeat themselves,"" and that Trudeau had brought ""totally dysfunctional government"" to Canada. ""It isn't just the economy, it isn't just the anti-Canadian culture, but it's also just that Canadian public services are not functioning properly,"" he said. While Harper gave credit to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre for leading the charge against the Liberal government, he added ""Trudeau largely did it to himself."" Harper also speculated on how the next few months would play out. He predicted that the new Liberal leader would be prime minister for ""only a few weeks"" before being forced to call an election that the party is virtually guaranteed to lose. A Liberal victory ""would require a miracle on their part, and some kind of disaster on (the Conservatives') part,"" he said. Harper said Trudeau's successor would be faced with the ""Kamala Harris problem"" - but worse. Harris, of course, was the Democratic nominee for U.S. president who attempted to run as a ""change"" candidate despite being an incumbent member of the Biden administration. Instead, voters picked her opponent, Republican nominee Donald Trump. The next Liberal leader will have to go through a leadership race that will see them affirm their loyalty to the party and the record of the current government, only to immediately turn around and face an electorate that is unsatisfied with the status quo. ""The person's in an impossible situation,"" said Harper. The interview also featured Harper being critical of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. Specifically, Trump's repeated public threats to annex Canada as the ""51st state."" At the start of the interview, Groisman framed Trump's bluster as being a bid to destabilize the Canadian government and renegotiate the U.S. trade relationship with its northern neighbour from a ""position of strength."" Harper was far less sanguine, saying that Trump was wildly misrepresenting one of the United States' closest friends and ""shared comrade in the propagation of the values of the free and democratic world everywhere."" ""I must admit to being shocked by some of the things that (Trump) said; they're just not so,"" said Harper. He focused in particular on Trump's frequent claim that Canada's trade surplus with the United States represents a subsidy. Harper said the surplus exists because of large quantities of Canadian oil purchased by the United States at a significant discount due to Canada's lack of alternative export options. ""It's actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard,"" said Harper. On the issue of border security, Harper said there's no real migrant crisis on the U.S. northern border, and that far more ""guns, drugs, crime"" were entering Canada from the other direction. He also expressed bafflement with the notion that Canada needs to step up its defence of the North American continent. Harper said the U.S. participates in alliances such as NORAD to ensure the ""defence of the United States."" ""Do you want Canada to be a neutral country?"" he said. ""I have a real problem with a lot of the things that Donald Trump is saying; it doesn't sound to me like the pronouncements of somebody who's a friend, a partner and an ally,"" he said. IN OTHER NEWS The race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader has only just begun, and it's already yielded one catastrophic faceplant. On Tuesday, former B.C. premier Christy Clark officially announced that - after months of learning French and declaring herself a ""lifelong Liberal"" - she had actually decided not to run for Liberal leader It might be related to the fact that the first major act of Clark's prime ministerial bid went down in flames last week. In an interview with CBC, she laughed at claims that she'd ever been a member of the Conservative Party - only for the Conservatives to immediately confirm that she became a member in 2022. This was the public letter put out by Rachel Bendayan, the Associate Minister of Public Safety, in response to plans by the radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir to hold a conference in Hamilton, Ont. Advertised as the Khilafah Conference, its aim was to discuss plans on how to conquer Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East and transform it into an authoritarian Islamic empire governed by sharia law. Early Tuesday morning, Hizb ut-Tahrir announced they'd scrapped the idea. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said this week that if the Trump administration hits Canada with tariffs while he's prime minister, he would retaliate. ""I would say to President Trump 'I will retaliate with trade tariffs against American goods that are necessary to discourage America attacking our industries,"" Poilievre told Victoria, B.C.'s CHEK News Poilievre also said that Trump's repeated threats against Canada were a signal that Canada should export its oil to more non-U.S. markets, and increase interprovincial trade to reduce reliance on cross-border trade. Former central banker Mark Carney kind-of, sort-of announced his official candidacy for the Liberal leadership this week - and he did it in front of a New York City TV audience. ""I am an outsider,"" Carney said in an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Stewart, in turn, compared Carney's prime ministerial bid to the campaign of failed U.S. presidential candidate Kamala Harris. ""Run. When I say run, I mean not for office. I mean f-king run, the other way,"" said the host.

Colby Cosh: Christy Clark should have doubled down on being a conservative,2025.0,"On Tuesday, former B.C. premier Christy Clark plopped out of the federal Liberal leadership race with the usual brusque announcement on Twitter. It is not too much to say that Clark became something of a national laughingstock last week after insisting on her perfect federal-Liberal bona fides. After announcing her prospective candidacy, she insisted that she had never been a member of the federal Conservative party. Thousands of people immediately flashed back to years of close co-operation between her B.C. Liberals and the federal Conservatives. Others recollected that she was a very public supporter of Jean Charest in the 2022 CPC leadership race, and that she had specifically declared her intention to join the CPC and cast a vote for Charest. She tried to weasel out by telling a CBC journalist that she had never actually followed through and bought a membership, and if you turned one ear to the west, you could actually hear British Columbians snickering and saying, ""Yup, that's our Christy."" Present-day CPC officials hastened to publish documentation showing that she had joined the Conservatives, receiving a sky-high quantitative ranking in the CPC database for political reliability, and that she had voted in their race. In her valediction, Clark didn't say anything about having commenced her campaign by insisting, almost to the point of getting a little shirty about it, on an easily refuted lie. She instead complained that Liberal candidates like her hadn't been given enough time to mount a proper national campaign, adding, ""I have worked hard at improving my French but it's not where it needs to be today."" As a result, she added, the Liberal party is incapable of appealing to ""a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of (Conservative Leader) Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" It's this last claim that fascinates me. Even in Conservative circles there's something of an argument over whether the woeful state of Liberal polling reflects extreme fatigue with Justin Trudeau personally or a popular revolt against the Liberal party per se. (A few weirdos may even think it possible that Poilievre is an outstanding political communicator who has successfully left his attack-dog reputation behind, and who enjoys legitimate personal popularity.) The Liberal race will be, in part, a test of these folk theories: even before the vote we'll learn just how much, to the nearest ounce, Trudeau was weighing the party down. But there are certainly some voters who, broadly speaking, would like small-c conservative policies delivered by someone other than a Conservative, or by someone other than Pierre Poilievre. So why couldn't Clark just have run explicitly as what she is: a longtime Conservative fellow-traveller, one with a pretty impressive electoral and economic track record in B.C., who thinks Poilievre needs to be challenged? Are the Liberals completely doomed to choose someone from the Trudeau rogue's gallery, someone who has the imprimatur of the same political machine operators who have been running the Prime Minister's Office for a decade? Clark has been stealthily flashing her dimples as a potential Trudeau successor for years, and had in fact been working hard in recent months to build support. Why did a well-placed and experienced change candidate refuse to go ahead and be that? Does anyone really think her loyalty to the federal Liberal gang was a legitimate, important issue?

What Ontarians can expect from federal climate program:   Levy has been focus of Poilievre's pre-election pitch,2025.0,"Canada Carbon Rebate payments will go out on Wednesday across Canada. But with Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre promising to ""Axe the Tax"" should he be elected, the future of the payments remains uncertain. Canadians will receive anywhere between $95 to $225 per quarter from the carbon price rebate, with most Ontarians receiving at least $140 per quarter, up from $122 last year thanks to a boost to the rebate in April 2024. The rebate is delivered every three months through deposits as a direct refund for the Liberal government's carbon levy - a program, often referred to by the opposition Conservatives as a ""carbon tax,"" that has two components. The program includes a pricing system for carbon-emitting heavy industries and a fuel charge on gasoline and home heating. The credit is meant to help individuals and families offset the extra costs from the federal government's pollution pricing, according to the Canada Revenue Agency. In a review of the program, the parliamentary budget officer found in July 2023 that most Canadians in 2021 got more from the Canada Carbon Rebate (CCR) than they paid through the carbon levy. But, the budget watchdog, in a more expansive analysis, found that Canadians would see a ""net loss"" in the coming years from the carbon pricing scheme and rebate. In Ontario, the carbon pricing program is administered at a federal level, with Ottawa returning 90 per cent of proceeds from those charges to eligible residents. The CCR has gained attention not only for its rebrand - which the government implemented in an attempt to make its contentious climate policy more palatable - but also for its resistance from provincial leaders. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, in February, said his province would not submit the money it owed for the carbon price on natural gas, leading to the federal government responding by threatening to deny payment of the rebate to Saskatchewan residents. Several premiers across the country, including Ontario Premier Doug Ford, called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to pause the carbon price increase on April 1. Trudeau did not oblige, accusing conservative premiers of ""(making) political hay"" out of the carbon price and challenging them to develop an alternative policy to reduce emissions. Residents of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario were eligible when the program first rolled out and the program was expanded in July 2023 to include Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. To receive the benefit, you must be a resident of a CCR-eligible province on the first day of the payment month. You must also be at least 19 years old. If you are under that age, you must either have (or previously had) a spouse or common-law partner, or are (or previously were) a parent and live (or previously lived) with your child. Ontarians eligible for the rebate will receive a base rebate of $140, with an additional $70 for a second adult in the family and $35 for each child under 19. A family of four in Ontario, according to the federal government, would receive $280. The payments are universal and not dependent on income levels. Here's how it breaks down by province, for an individual, per quarter: Alberta: $225 Manitoba: $150 New Brunswick: $95 Newfoundland/Labrador: $149 Nova Scotia: $103 Ontario: $140 Prince Edward Island: $110 Saskatchewan: $188 The CCR also includes a 20 per cent supplemental bump for residents in small and rural communities, which includes all eligible P.E.I. residents, according to the government. However, some rural communities have spoken out about the rules demarcating rural towns, saying the government has unfairly looped them in with nearby cities. Eligible CCR recipients should see the credit in the form of a cheque or direct deposit automatically, without needing to apply. If you have a spouse or common-law partner, the person whose tax return was assessed first will receive the total credit for the family. It doesn't matter which person receives the rebate as the total amount will be the same.

"Field narrows in race to lead Liberals:   House leader Gould will join contest while Champagne, Clark decline to run",2025.0,"The race to replace Justin Trudeau winnowed to just a few major contenders Tuesday, as more and more Liberals decide to stay on the sidelines in their party's coming leadership contest. The two most anticipated candidates - former finance minister Chrystia Freeland and former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney - are expected to launch their campaigns later this week. A source close to the Carney campaign, speaking confidentially to discuss deliberations, said his announcement would come on Thursday, but the former central banker came very close to revealing his intentions Monday evening during an appearance on the U.S. television talk show ""The Daily Show."" In an interview with host Jon Stewart, Carney described a ""wild hypothetical"" of a Liberal leader who could take on a populist right-wing opponent like Pierre Poilievre. ""Let's say the candidate wasn't part of the government. Let's say the candidate did have a lot of economic experience. Let's say the candidate did deal with crises. Let's say the candidate had a plan to deal with the challenges in the here and now,"" he said. Sources close to Freeland said she intends to announce her candidacy before U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, and will pledge to impose ""dollar-for-dollar"" matching tariffs for any tariffs the new U.S. president brings in. The other candidate who sources confirmed will enter the leadership race this week is House leader Karina Gould. Unlike Carney and Freeland, who have long been rumoured as potential successors to Trudeau, Gould's name has only come up recently. Gould was first elected in 2015 when the Trudeau government came to power. She has previously served as the minister of democratic institutions, international development and families, and children and social development. At 37, Gould would likely be the youngest candidate in the leadership race. She made history as the first person to give birth and take maternity leave while serving as a federal cabinet minister. Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said last week he was ""seriously considering"" a leadership run, but has issued no further updates since. Since Trudeau announced his pending resignation, several Liberal cabinet ministers who had been considered potential successors have declined to enter the leadership race - and, in at least one case, said they would bow out of politics entirely. On Tuesday, former B.C. premier Christy Clark, who was widely expected to run and had assembled a significant organization, said the timing of Trudeau's resignation did not leave her enough time to mount a viable campaign. ""While we have come a long way in a short time, there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with Francophone Canadians in their language,"" she said. ""I have worked hard at improving my French but it's not where it needs to be today."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne also said Tuesday he would not enter the race. Speaking to a Canadian Club luncheon in Toronto, Champagne said he would stay focused on his current job, and on Trump's threats to the Canadian economy. ""I came to the conclusion that I will not be seeking to be the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada for the upcoming race. I will dedicate my energy to defending Canada, to defending Canadians, to defending Canadian businesses,"" he said. Pressed if he would run again in the next general election, Champagne didn't answer. ""Can I take one decision at a time?"" he replied. ""Because this is already a big day for me."" Like Champagne, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly have said they won't join the contest because they need to focus on their current jobs as Trump threatens to impose tariffs on Canadian goods when he becomes president next week. Like Clark, Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon cited the tight timeline in his announcement over the weekend that he would not seek the leadership. Treasury Board President Anita Anand has also dropped out of contention after years of speculation that she would seek the leadership. Anand also announced she won't run again in the next general election, adding to the large number of Liberal MPs who have said they would not seek another term. The Liberal Party of Canada set the rules for the leadership race last week, which require candidates to provide a $350,000 entrance fee and give them just 13 days to sign up new members. The new leader will be announced on March 9 after party members vote in a preferential ballot. The details of how voting will take place have not been announced, nor has a convention location. Clark was premier of British Columbia from 2011 to 2017, leading the B.C. Liberals through election campaigns in 2013 and 2017. While the Liberals won the most seats in the 2017 election, they did not have a majority, and their government was toppled by the New Democrats with the support of the B.C. Greens. Clark had urged the federal Liberals to move back toward the centre of the political spectrum and to focus on the economy. ""We must redefine the Liberal party as a big-tent party again - one that will fight for jobs, workers, investment and growth,"" she said. Apart from federal Liberals, Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey is also considering whether to run, according to two party sources. Furey had planned to support LeBlanc. However, since the finance minister said he would not seek the leadership, Furey has fielded calls from what one insider described as ""Chrétien Liberals"" and ""strategically centre Liberals"" who don't like the options being presented to them. Furey is one of two Liberal premiers in Canada. He speaks a little French but is not bilingual. So far, only three people have formally declared their candidacies for the Liberal leadership: Ottawa MP Chandra Arya, former MP Frank Baylis and Nova Scotia MP Jaime Battiste.

Who pushed Trudeau to resign? Harper says 'Trump will like to believe' it was him but it wasn't,2025.0,"Stephen Harper said it was Canadians, not economic pressure from U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, that led Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to say he will resign. Canada's last Conservative prime minister set the record straight during an interview for an upcoming episode of Standpoint, a podcast by U.S.-based political commentator Gabe Groisman. While there's clear animosity between the world leaders, which he chalks up to Trudeau's lack of ""professional"" conduct while the two were in office, Trump needn't claim a victory in this regard. ""I know Donald Trump will like to believe that he's pushed Mr. Trudeau out of office, but let me assure you, it was Canadian public opinion and ultimately Mr. Trudeau's own party that pushed him out of office."" Did Stephen Harper just respond to Donald Trump's 51st U.S. state threat? Canada 'is not for sale': Ford has 'a better deal for Trump' instead of becoming 51st U.S. state Harper said the prime minister was in a ""no-win"" situation when he travelled to Trump's compound in Florida after Trump's initial threat of 25 per cent tariff on Canadian imports. While his attendance made it ""look like he was grovelling,"" Harper believes choosing to ignore an invitation would have been seen as not addressing an international relationship in need of repair. Canada's 22nd prime minister also doesn't have much hope for whoever picks up the mantle of new Liberal leader in late March. Likening their plight to that of U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris, who had to carry forth the Democratic party's record when she became its presidential candidate in July, Harper said a new Grit boss would quickly be faced with an election ""where nobody wants that record to continue."" ""It's hard for me to imagine how they could reframe the government that's so unpopular and make themselves electable in the space of a few weeks,"" he said. Harper 'shocked' at Trump's 51st U.S. state idea Harper said he has a ""real problem"" with some of the things Trump has been suggesting about that country's relationship with its northern neighbours. The Albertan said he was surprised and ""shocked"" at the incoming president's insistence that the U.S. subsidizes the Canadian economy and his tariff threats. ""It doesn't sound to me like the pronouncements of somebody who's a friend, a partner and an ally, which is what I've always thought the United States is for our country,"" Harper said during the 31-minute interview titled ""Canada: the 51st State?!"" BREAKING: Former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper pushes back on President Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state. ""We want to be friends, not annex."" - Gabriel Groisman (@GabeGroisman) January 13, 2025 Trump has also claimed that Canadians want to see it happen. Harper said that's not true. ""We have our own culture, our own history. We're very proud of it and very proud of our relationship with the United States. But we are Canadian, not American, and we want to be friends, not, as they say, annexed."" Last week, Harper appeared to respond to Trump's most recent threat of using ""economic force"" with an X post featuring a 2011 speech set over various images and videos portraying the country and its people. ""True when I said it, true today,"" he wrote. Harper counters Trump's Canadian claims Describing himself as ""probably the most pro-American prime minister"" in Canada's history, in his view the relationship with the U.S. is one of ""Canada's greatest assets."" But he countered Trump's assertions that the U.S. does not need Canadian exports, pointing specifically to oil and gas sold at a discounted price compared to global markets. ""It's actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard,"" Harper said. ""Maybe Canadians, if Mr. Trump feels this way, should be looking at selling their oil and gas to other people. We certainly have always wanted to do some of that. Maybe now's the time to do it."" On defence subsidy, Harper doesn't understand Trump's subsidy argument and wonders if the U.S. wants ""Canada to become a neutral country."" And while he's ""sympathetic"" to Trump's position on the influx of illegal migrants across U.S. borders, calling President Joe Biden's open borders policy a ""violation of his fundamental duties to the country,"" Canada is not their biggest problem. ""There is no migrant flow happening from Canada to the United States at any significant numbers, and I'm going to tell you right now, drugs, guns, crime, most of those things flow north, not south,"" Harper emphasized. ""A lot more flows into Canada from the United States than flows out of it.""",National Post (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Oliver, Kenn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 14, 2025",Presidential elections; Subsidies; Prime ministers; Tariffs,,2025-01-14,National Post
"Clark and Champagne bow out of Liberal leadership race, as Gould prepares to launch",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Former B.C. premier Christy Clark and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne both announced on Tuesday they won't run to become leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Meanwhile, Liberal House leader Karina Gould is expected to launch her leadership campaign later this week. Clark, who was one of the most prominent potential candidates, announced to supporters that morning that ""there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with Francophone Canadians in their language."" ""I have worked hard at improving my French, but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she wrote in an email sent to supporters. Many prominent Liberals, including Champagne, recently said the next leader must speak French and understand Quebec. In that email, Clark wrote that despite the fact she has been able to assemble a team of ""hundreds"" of organizers from across the country, she has ""made the difficult decision to step back."" She first broke the news to them over a Zoom call with about 40 organizers roughly 20 minutes before her news went public. She has spent months laying the groundwork for a potential bid before making Tuesday's decision. As late as Sunday evening, she was sending emails to supporters and meeting with organizers. Clark's decision comes after she claimed to have misspoken to the CBC Radio show The House when she repeatedly denied ever having been a member of the federal Conservative party and voting in its 2022 leadership race, despite having declared so in previous speeches and media interviews. Clark didn't mention the CBC interview which aired over the weekend in her email to supporters and instead pointed to the short time frame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left for prospective contenders, given his decision to announce on Jan. 6 he was stepping down. ""The timing of the prime minister's resignation just did not leave enough time for the party to build a process that will renew and grow our party,"" said Clark. ""Our party must still find a way to generate new momentum and energy. To open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" Hours later, Champagne told a group of Toronto business people that he would not run to become Canada's next prime minister. ""I thought about it carefully. I came to the conclusion that I will not be seeking the leadership in this race. It was probably the most difficult decision in my life, but I think it is the right one at this time,"" Champagne told journalist Amanda Lang at the Canadian Club. That means no francophones or prominent Quebec candidates will run to succeed Trudeau, himself a Quebecer. Champagne was considered the Quebec Liberals' last great hope in the race, and he was seriously considering running. Even former prime minister Jean Chrétien recently said he would personally support a Champagne candidacy. Champagne represents Chrétien's former riding of Saint-Maurice-Champlain. ""He would be very good, but it's a personal choice,"" Chrétien told Radio-Canada. The historical tradition of alternating between an anglophone and a Francophone leader at the head of the party will prevail. ""There is no message to Quebecers here. The only thing we can see in this is that those who hoped that the principle of alternation would be a thing of the past have their answer. It is not a thing of the past,"" said Jeremy Ghio, a former political staffer to Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a director at the communication firm Tact in Montreal. Earlier on Tuesday, a source close to Government House Leader Karina Gould said she plans to launch her campaign to become the next leader of the Liberal Party of Canada this week. Prospective candidates have until Jan. 23 to register to run and until Jan. 27 to sign up new members. The winner will be announced on March 9. Speaking at an unrelated news conference in her Burlington, Ont., riding, Gould declined to confirm her intentions, saying only: ""I'll have more to say in the coming days."" The tight constraints of the race, which includes the requirement to raise $350,000, has meant other potential successors to Trudeau have bowed out of the contest, such as Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon. More prominent cabinet ministers such as, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc cited the need to dedicate his energy to bracing for the incoming president of U.S-president elect Donald Trump, who is threatening to slap 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods. Gould, who was first elected when the party came to power back in 2015, would be the youngest candidate in the race at 37 and the only Millennial. She made history as the country's youngest woman appointed to cabinet and the first minister to take maternity leave. Her plan to enter the race comes amid growing anxieties about the ability to own a home for those under 40 and a time when many of the young progressives who first voted for Trudeau back in 2015 have turned away from the party. ""I think it is extremely important that we have a younger voice in the race who can relate to people where they are and the struggles that they're facing today,"" she told reporters in Burlington, Ont. Other expected contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who one source has said is expected to launch his campaign this week, and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland ,whose team has not been as definitive on timing. Gould serves as the government's House Leader in the House of Commons and before that was the minister responsible for shepherding the signing of national child care deals with provinces and territories, which was a signature policy of the Trudeau government. She is also Jewish and has two young children. As Liberals begin to line up behind their picks for leader, former cabinet minister Shelia Copps told CBC News she was throwing her support to Gould, saying she is young, speaks four languages and is a skilled communicator, which the party needs. A source close to Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who is in Washington ahead of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next week, is still mulling a potential bid, with hopes to arrive at a decision by the end of the week.

Former B.C. premier Christy Clark announces she won't run for Liberal leadership,2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark, who was considering a run for the federal Liberal leadership, says she's made the difficult decision to step back. ""There are vitally important issues that need to be addressed - confronting an aggressive U.S. trade threat, fighting for a strong, united Canada, and restoring faith in our institutions. But, most important of all, getting Canada's economy firing on all cylinders again,"" Clark said Tuesday in a message to supporters. Although Clark said she has been working on her French, she hasn't become fluent. ""While we have come a long way, in a short time, there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with francophone Canadians in their language. I have worked hard at improving my French but it's not where it needs to be, today,"" she said. Clark said the Liberal party must find a way to generate new momentum and energy, and open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out. ""I won't be in this leadership race, but I won't stop fighting. Pierre Poilievre would rather attack Canadians than call out Donald Trump. He's a bully when he's here at home and a pathetic pushover for the MAGA Republicans. We don't need Governor Poilievre. We need the Liberal party at the top of its game,"" said Clark. Last week, Clark backtracked on her claim that she'd never been a member of the Conservative party. She told CBC Radio's The House that she was ""very seriously"" considering a leadership bid, but expressed disappointment with the short timeline for the race. She also denied she voted for former Quebec premier Jean Charest in his bid to become Conservative leader in 2022, a race that was won by Poilievre. Clark, who has called herself a ""lifelong Liberal,"" said in the interview that despite publicly supporting Charest's leadership run she never joined the party and never received a ballot for the race. The Liberal party said the new leader will be named March 9 to replace outgoing leader Justin Trudeau. Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney has suggested he will launch a leadership bid this week. Former Montreal MP Frank Baylis and Nepean, Ont., MP Chandra Arya have also said they plan to run. A source told The Canadian Press Monday that former finance minister Chrystia Freeland will also announce her intention to run for the leadership just before the U.S. presidential inauguration. ticrawford@postmedia.com With files from The Canadian Press Related Ex-B.

"BREAKING: Christy Clark bows out of Liberal leadership race, as Gould prepares to launch",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Former B.C. premier Christy Clark announced to supporters Tuesday morning that she won't run in the Liberal leadership race. In an email sent to supporters, Clark wrote that despite the fact she has been able to assemble a team of ""hundreds"" of organizers from across the country, she has ""made the difficult decision to step back."" She broke the news to them over a Zoom call with about 40 organizers roughly 20 minutes before the news went public. ""We have come a long way, in a short time, there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with Francophone Canadians in their language,"" Clark wrote. ""I have worked hard at improving my French but it's not where it needs to be, today."" Clark's decision comes after she claimed to have misspoken to CBC's radio show The House when she repeatedly denied ever having been a member of the federal Conservative party and voting in its 2022 leadership race, despite having declared so in previous speeches and media interviews. Clark didn't mention the CBC interview in her email to supporters and instead pointed to the short time frame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left for prospective contenders, after he announced he was stepping down on Jan. 6. ""The timing of the prime minister's resignation just did not leave enough time for the party to build a process that will renew and grow our party,"" said Clark. ""Our party must still find a way to generate new momentum and energy. To open itself up to a broader group of Canadians who have felt left out, but who can't abide the snarling, sneering politics of (Conservative Leader) Pierre Poilievre or the unrealistic approach of the NDP."" The former B.C. premier had spent months laying the groundwork for a potential leadership, including by travelling to Quebec to learn French. As late as Sunday evening, she was emailing the more than ""250"" people who she says had volunteered to organize her campaign, saying the Liberals needed to square their focus on ""Paycheques. Jobs. The cost of groceries. Gas."" Earlier on Tuesday, a source close to Government House Leader Karina Gould said she plans to launch her campaign to become the next leader of the Liberal Party of Canada this week. Prospective candidates have until Jan. 23 to register to run and until Jan. 27 to sign up new members. The tight constraints of the race, which includes the requirement to fundraise $350,000, has meant other potential successors to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have bowed out of the contest, which was triggered by the prime minister's resignation on Jan. 6 Gould, who was first elected when the party came to power back in 2015, would be the youngest candidate in the race and the only millennial. Other expected contenders include former Bank of Canada and Bank governor Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. She currently serves as the government's House Leader in the House of Commons and before that was the minister responsible for shepherding the signing of national child care deals with provinces and territories, which was a signature policy of the Trudeau government. She is also Jewish and has two young children.

"'I am an outsider': Carney rips Poilievre, makes Liberal leadership case on The Daily Show",2025.0,"OTTAWA - Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney used an interview on U.S. late-night television on Monday to attack Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and make his case for the Liberal leadership. In an interview with The Daily Show host Jon Stewart, Carney didn't definitively say he would launch a campaign for the leadership in the wake of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau but he did say that a ""hypothetical"" outsider candidate was better positioned to run for the job while U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on Canadian goods. National Post has reported last week that Carney is likely to launch his campaign later this week, along with former B.C. Premier Christy Clark. Carney wasn't shy about attacking Poilievre after Stewart said Poilievre seemed ""very off-putting"" and ""like a villain in a Karate Kid movie."" ""There is a type of politician - you have a few of them here in the United States and they had a lot in and around Brexit and we have Mr. Poilievre in Canada - a type of politician who tend to be lifelong politician, really tend to worship the market but they've never actually worked in the private sector,"" said Carney. ""And they see opportunity in tragedy, like you just had with the fires, these horrible fires, and they see opportunity in tragedy to push an agenda...,"" said Carney, who accused Poilievre of wanting to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to cut taxes and government workers. Carney also told Stewart that the race for Liberal leadership was short on candidates because so many ministers believe they have to focus on the ""crisis"" caused by the threat of tariffs being imposed on Canadian goods, rather than party politics or personal ambition. By not being part of the government, Carney argued he was better positioned to run for Trudeau's job. ""Wild hypothetical. Let's say the candidate wasn't part of the government. Let's say the candidate did have a lot of economic experience. Let's say the candidate did deal with prices. Let's say the candidate had a plan to deal with the challenges in the here and now,"" said Carney. ""You sneaky... you're running as an outsider,"" said Stewart. ""I am an outsider,"" said Carney. The baggage Mark Carney is bringing to his prime ministerial bid All eyes are on Champagne as Quebec waits for a Liberal leadership candidate The Conservatives pushed back on Carney's characterization of himself, saying he is the ""furthest thing possible from an outsider,"" after being a long-time Liberal ""insider, advisor"" and the chair of the party's economic growth task force. Carney also criticized Trudeau's government for taking its eye off the ball while inflation soared and housing became unaffordable in Canada. ""Canadians have been very hard-pressed the last few years. Wages have not kept up with inflation. People are are falling behind, not getting ahead. Housing is very expensive, and there's this broader concern - again, exclamation point put on by the Trump tariffs - about what the future brings,"" said Carney. ""Truth be told, the government has been not as focused on those issues as it could be. We need to focus on them immediately. That can happen now, and that's what this election will be about it,"" said Carney. In response, Stewart warned Carney that it reminded him of the U.S. election, which Democratic candidate Kamala Harris lost to Trump after replacing U.S. President Joe Biden as the candidate. ""Can I tell you something? I feel like I'm looking in a mirror. We just had that election. Run. When I say run, I mean not for office. I mean f-king run, the other way,"" said Stewart. ""It's so hard, when the headwinds are like that. It's really difficult for a candidate to come in who is saddled with the policies,"" said Stewart. In response to a question about how Carney would be ""left holding the carbon tax bag,"" which Stewart argued was ""not politically feasible,"" Carney hinted that he would target the oil and gas industry with climate policy. ""Almost 30 per cent of our emissions from Canada come from the production and shipment of oil to the United States,"" said Carney. ""So part of it is cleaning that up, getting those emissions down, more than changing, in a very short period of time, the way Canadians live.""

"Christy Clark bows out of Liberal leadership race while Karina Gould is expected to launch bid this week:   Meanwhile, likely front-runners Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland have not formally announced their bids but are expected to this week",2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark has decided not to enter the Liberal leadership race while cabinet minister Karina Gould is expected to launch her own bid by the end of the week. In an email obtained by The Globe and Mail on Tuesday, Ms. Clark told her supporters she was taking a “step back.” “While we have come a long way, in a short time, there is simply not enough time to mount a successful campaign and for me to effectively connect with Francophone Canadians in their language,” Ms. Clark said in the email to supporters. “I have worked hard at improving my French but it’s not where it needs to be, today.” Her decision narrows the front-runner race down to former central banker Mark Carney and ex-finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Neither has formally announced their bids but are expected to this week. Sources close to Ms. Gould’s campaign meantime said she will launch her own race by Sunday. Ms. Gould is expected to aim for the party’s progressive wing, according to two other sources familiar with her campaign planning. The 37-year-old government house leader is the youngest leadership hopeful, with two small children. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources because they were not permitted to disclose the plans which are still being finalized.

"B.C. Insider: Christy Clark’s scrappy bid for Liberal leadership as an outsider:   The deadline for contenders for the Liberal leadership is Jan. 23, and the entry fee is $350,000",2025.0,"Good morning. Former B.C. premier Christy Clark has finely honed her political instincts her entire adult life and has a proven ability to be scrappy when warranted, charming when needed. Her come-from-behind win in B.C. in 2013 shocked even members of her own caucus. Even when the winning ran out by 2017 on a B.C. Liberal brand that had worn out its welcome after 16 years, Clark still had the most seats in a minority government before it fell. So her badly botched entry into a narrowing group of people considering a run to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader, one she’s clearly been noodling for years, is a head-scratcher for someone so well versed in the street fight that is politics. Last week, Clark had to admit that she had “misspoke” when she told CBC radio’s The House that she had “never” had a membership in the Conservative party, despite having told reporters numerous times in 2022 that she was a member and was voting in that contest to support former Quebec premier Jean Charest. “I’m a lifelong Liberal, but I joined the Conservative party so I could vote, because I felt like it was my civic duty to make sure that we were supporting candidates who care about the things we hold in common,” Ms. Clark told CTV just a week before the Conservative leadership vote in 2022. As The Globe and Mail reported last week from Ottawa, when Ms. Cullen told Clark that the Conservatives confirmed she held a membership, Clark said she never received the card nor a ballot, and said she wouldn’t put it past the party to “manufacture” one of them. After the Conservatives produced a copy of her membership record, Clark walked back her comments: “I misspoke,” she said in a statement posted to social media. “I have always been clear that I supported Jean Charest to stop Pierre Poilievre. Not backing away from that.” Clark then pivoted to what she really wants Liberal party members to hear: “He [Poilievre] still needs to be stopped. But if we want to do that, our party has to accept change. Sticking with the status quo is a losing strategy.” She then found herself pounded by criticism from all sides. Jenni Byrne, a senior adviser to Poilievre, posted Clark’s membership online, without caustic comment; Byrne hardly needed to rub it in further. Former Liberal environment minister Catherine McKenna, who is backing former central banker Mark Carney for the Liberal leadership, was more derisive. “Dear Liberals: I can confirm that Christy Clark is a Conservative. Worse: She thinks politics is saying whatever is required to win,” she wrote on social media. “The worst kind of politics.” While Clark’s effort to hide her dalliance with the Conservatives is inexplicable and no doubt damaging, her original reason for signing up with the party to vote for Charest is entirely in keeping with her history as a centrist. Clark worked on Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien’s 1990 leadership campaign, and again on his 1993 election. She then joined his government as a staffer. She was elected as a BC Liberal MLA in 1996 and was key to the party’s hounding and eventual trouncing of NDP premier Glen Clark. In 2001, when the BC Liberals swept all but two seats in the legislature, she sat among a coalition of MLAs who had been active as federal Liberals and federal Conservatives. MLAs were instructed to leave their federal proclivities at the caucus door. When her minority government fell in 2017, she joined law firm Bennett Jones as an adviser, but never really left politics. In 2022, she was the keynote speaker at a gathering of supporters of Centre-Ice Conservatives, talking about the moderate middle. Panelists included former Conservative senator Marjory LeBreton. Clark told Globe reporter Ian Bailey at the time – in another display of misjudgment – that she thought Poilievre would likely pivot to the political centre after winning the Conservative leadership. “I think that most politicians, when they finish their leadership race, change a little bit,” Clark said in an interview. “He’s a smart guy … he’s going to have a choice to make about how he wants to speak to Canadians about the things we share in common.” Last spring, after the federal Liberals lost a by-election for the Toronto-St. Paul’s riding, a seat it had held for three decades, Clark said it was time for Trudeau to go. Beyond the leadership change, the former premier said the party needs to change its focus and lay out an economic agenda. The deadline for contenders for the Liberal leadership is Jan. 23, and the entry fee is $350,000. Clark was expected to run as an outsider.

Harper pushes back on Trump's comments:   Former PM critical of claim that U.S. is subsidizing Canada,2025.0,"Former prime minister Stephen Harper says he has ""a real problem"" with some of Donald Trump's recent statements about Canada, describing them as incorrect and out-of-sync with the long-standing friendship between this country and the United States. His comments come after former prime minister Jean Chrétien wrote an op-ed in the Globe and Mail calling on Trump to ""give your head a shake,"" after the U.S. president-elect spoke of using ""economic force"" to annex Canada. Trump has also repeatedly taunted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the ""governor"" of a fictional ""51st"" American state. Harper, the leader who helped found the modern Conservative party now dominating in national opinion polls, made his comments in an interview on a podcast with conservative commentator Gabriel Groisman. ""I must admit to being shocked by some of the things he said,"" Harper said in the interview posted online Monday. Describing himself as probably ""the most pro-American prime minister in the history of our country,"" Harper pushed back on a series of Trump's recent claims about Canada. He questioned Trump's insistence that the U.S. is subsidizing Canada to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, which Trump has raised when discussing the need for punishing 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imports. Echoing recent comments from current Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, Harper said the ""modest"" trade deficit that the U.S. has with Canada is largely because the country buys so much oil and gas from Western Canada - fossil fuels sold at a ""discount"" because the Canadian market relies so much on the sole customer of the U.S. ""It's actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard,"" Harper said. ""Maybe Canadians, if Mr. Trump feels this way, should be looking at selling their oil and gas to other people."" Harper also said he doesn't understand how Trump can argue the U.S. is paying for Canadian defence, stating that the two countries have a partnership to defend North America. ""The United States does that because it's in the vital interest of the United States. Do you want Canada to be a neutral country?"" Harper said.

"Trump’s threats and complaints not the words of an ally: Harper:   Canada sells oil and gas to U.S. at a discount, but should consider selling to other countries instead, former PM says",2025.0,"Former prime minister Stephen Harper says some of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s threats and complaints about Canada do not sound like the words of a “friend, a partner and an ally.” Mr. Harper said in a podcast interview released Monday that Canada is currently subsidizing Americans by selling them petroleum at a discount and should consider selling its oil and gas to other countries instead. Mr. Trump’s thoughts about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should have no bearing on Canada, Mr. Harper told U.S. internet talk show host Gabe Groisman, adding that whether the Liberal Leader remained in power or departed is none of the presidentelect’s business. Mr. Harper, who described himself as probably the most “pro-American prime minister in Canada’s history,” said he was still shocked by some of Mr. Trump’s comments. The president-elect, who is set to take office next Monday, has threatened 25-per-cent tariffs on all Canadian goods until Canada stops illegal migration and drug smuggling into American territory. He’s also repeatedly referred to Canada as the “51st state” and called Mr. Trudeau its “governor,” and said he plans to try to use “economic force” to coax Canadians into annexation by the U.S. Mr. Trump has also complained repeatedly about a trade deficit with Canada, where Canadians sell roughly $100-billion more annually to Americans than they buy from the U.S. Mr. Harper dismissed this concern, saying it’s largely because of Canada’s big oil and gas sales to Americans at a price that tends to be lower than what the petroleum could fetch on world markets. Canada lacks sufficient capacity to export oil and gas overseas. “It is true that Canada presently has a modest trade surplus with the United States. The reason we do is because you buy so much of our oil and gas,” he said on Standpoint with Gabe Groisman. “In fact, you buy it at a discount to world markets. It’s actually Canada that subsidizes the United States in this regard.” He said Canada should be seeking other customers: “Maybe Canadians, if Mr. Trump feels this way, should be looking at selling their oil and gas to other people. We certainly have always wanted to do some of that – maybe now’s the time to do it.” Mr. Trump last week also disparaged Canada’s military and said Canadians rely on the U.S. for defence: “They don’t essentially have a military. They have a very small military. They rely on our military. It’s all fine, but they’ve got to pay for that.” Mr. Harper challenged that position: “When we talk about subsidizing Canadian defence, I don’t know what he’s talking about. We have a shared defence of North America, and the United States does that because it’s in the vital interest of the United States.” He also rejected Mr. Trump’s characterization of illegal migration into the U.S. from Canada as a major problem. “There is no migrant flow happening from Canada the United States of any significant numbers. And I’m going to tell you right now, drugs, guns, crime – most of those things flow north, not south,” he said. “I have a real problem with some of the things Donald Trump is saying,” he said, adding that “it doesn’t sound to me like the pronouncements of somebody who’s a friend, a partner and an ally, which is what I’ve always thought the United States is for our country.” He also criticized Mr. Trudeau for what he called unprofessional behaviour toward Mr. Trump during the American leader’s last term in office. But when his interviewer suggested that some of Mr. Trump’s attacks on Canada were intended to “push Mr. Trudeau out the door,” Mr. Harper said that’s not the president-elect’s call. “Look, whether or not we have Mr. Trudeau as our prime minister is our choice as Canadians. You know, we don’t tell you whom to elect as president of the United States,” Mr. Harper said. “And so, as much as I’m glad to see Mr. Trudeau leaving, this is not Mr. Trump’s decision. It’s the decision of Canadians. Ultimately, it was the decision of Mr. Trudeau’s own party.” Mr. Trump, speaking to media last Tuesday, made the case for annexing Canada: “Canada and the United States: That would be really something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like.” The president-elect also tried to make the case that Canada has little leverage over the U.S. He listed off all the Canadian imports that he felt Americans could do without, from automobiles to lumber to dairy products. Mr. Harper said Canadians hope Mr. Trump is joking about annexation, and that Canada’s strong and abiding alliance and partnership with the U.S. is “hinged on us believing that the United States is a friend, not that the United States wants to conquer or annex Canada.” He noted that polls suggest Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will win the next federal election, and that “if the United States actually threatens the sovereignty and independence of Canada, Mr. Poilievre will be forced to take a very different approach to Canada’s place in the world.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Chase, Steven",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 14, 2025",Canadians; Presidents; Prime ministers; Canada-US relations; International trade; Trade policy; Annexation; Tariffs,,2025-01-14,The Globe and Mail
Poilievre needs to think 'bigly'; Negotiating with Trump,2025.0,"Donald Trump will become U.S. president on Jan. 20. He's already given some indication of what he's thinking of doing when he returns to the White House. It may be bluster, and it may never materialize, but the next Liberal prime minister - and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who seems destined to become PM - must be prepared to deal with it. The president-elect went on a tear at a press conference last week. He mused about changing the Gulf of Mexico's name to Gulf of America, which he suggested had a ""beautiful ring"" to it. He didn't discount military action to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal, believing the U.S. needs them ""for economic security."" Trump's belief that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state was also addressed. Even though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is finally on his way out, and the endless jokes about him becoming ""governor"" are nearly done, Trump's position seems to be the same. Trump was asked about Poilievre's post on X, in which he called the U.S. our country's ""best friend"" but noted ""Canada will never be the 51st state. Period."" He scoffed at this and said, ""That's all right. Maybe he won't win, but maybe he will. I don't care."" When asked if he was going to use military force to annex Canada, he replied, ""No, economic force. Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security. Again, we basically protect Canada."" Trudeau, a lame duck prime minister, remains at the helm. He's already pushed back, but it's completely meaningless. Trump has no time, interest or respect for Trudeau. The next Liberal PM will be in the same boat, tainted by the foul stench of Trudeau's feeble leadership. He or she will try to put a fresh coat of paint on the weathered Liberal government, but it's going to quickly peel away. Poilievre needs to focus on both points. Unlike Trudeau, who didn't have the ability to deal with Trump, the Conservative leader is a far superior politician with exceptional communications skills. He has a strong personality, intelligent ideas, and clear direction for Canada in the present and future. What about Trump's dismissive attitude? It's just political trash-talking. He privately knows, or has been advised, that Poilievre has been way ahead in the polls for years. In spite of what he said, he's aware that Poilievre is a different political animal who's likely going to win, and he'll have to work around him. What does Poilievre have to do to successfully work with an unconventional leader like Trump? To negotiate with Trump, you have to negotiate like Trump. The president-elect will reportedly implement the 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian products after he's been inaugurated. Hence, Poilievre needs to craft a similar formula about business deals and strategies that Trump and Tony Schwartz posited in The Art of the Deal. ""I like thinking big. I always have,"" Trump wrote in one chapter. ""To me it's very simple: If you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big."" Here's how Poilievre can think big. He needs to keep defending and protecting Canadian sovereignty and independence, but work with Trump to improve border security and safety. That's always been Trump's main beef with Canada and Mexico. ""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!,"" he wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 25, 2024. Poilievre, like Trump, also believes in stronger border safety and security. That's a way to find common ground without him giving up an inch of political ground. Poilievre shouldn't get too worked up about the Canada-51st U.S. state taunt. It's a tactic to get under people's skin, and Trump is a master of it. Instead, propose sensible ways to improve economic relations between our two countries and suggest appealing free market-oriented ideas. Some possibilities include eliminating supply management in the dairy industry, reducing foreign ownership restrictions and working toward a strong economic union. He also needs to show good faith and a willingness to work hand-in-hand with Trump. Not by giving in to every demand, but recognizing there are gaps that need to be addressed with a common-sense approach. This will hopefully lead to either a gradual reduction or complete elimination of the tariff rate for agreeing to move forward and much further than Trudeau ever proposed. Above all, Poilievre can't lose patience with Trump. Some Canadian pundits and commentators believe we should tell Trump to take a hike. That's the worst tactic he can take. Poilievre is a passionate and determined individual, which are good personality traits, but he must stay focused on the task at hand. Trump will keep pushing his buttons to find a breaking point like he did with Trudeau. Poilievre can't ever give him the opportunity to believe he's achieved this. Otherwise, it could lead to a years-long trade war that could wreck the Canadian economy. Poilievre's key to success will be being proactive rather than reactive in dealing with Trump. If he becomes prime minister, I strongly believe he can achieve this.

Poilievre's public payroll hypocrisy,2025.0,"I'd like to comment on federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's response to Justin Trudeau stepping down as federal Liberal leader. Poilievre posted an online video of his response and at one point basically said that Liberal MPs pushed Trudeau out ""to protect their pensions and paycheque."" Seriously, Pierre? You've spent nearly your whole adult life on the public payroll! You've been an MP for 20 years and were first elected to Parliament at age 25. Before that, you were a political staffer. You've hardly ever worked outside of politics. Do you have any idea what your comments sound like? Are you really that lacking in self-awareness? If you're so righteous, why couldn't you be bothered to have a proper news conference and face reporters'questions? Oh, yeah, right. The news media is part of the Liberal-left elite which always treats conservatives so unfairly. If you and your Tory colleagues object so much to MPs'generous paycheques and pensions, why don't you put your money where your mouths are, step down from your seats and go out and get ""real jobs""? Oh, but no! Tory MPs are there to serve their constituents; it's the MPs from other parties who are there for the paycheques and pensions.

Liberal leadership hopeful Christy Clark says she “misspoke” about voting for Conservatives:   Clark falsely claimed she was never a member of the federal Conservative party,2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark’s prospects of a successful bid for the federal Liberal leadership race took a hit after she falsely claimed she was never a member of the federal Conservative party. Ms. Clark, whose B.C. Liberal party was a mix of Liberals and Conservatives, was asked about her past relationship with the Conservatives in an interview with CBC’s radio program The House, which aired Saturday. She told host Catherine Cullen that she’d “never” had a membership in the Conservative party, despite having told reporters numerous times in 2022 that she was a member and was voting in that contest to support former Quebec premier Jean Charest. “I’m a lifelong Liberal but I joined the Conservative party so I could vote, because I felt like it was my civic duty to make sure that we were supporting candidates who care about the things we hold in common,” Ms. Clark told CTV just a week before the Conservative leadership vote in 2022. When Ms. Cullen told Ms. Clark the Conservatives confirmed she held a membership, Ms. Clark said she never received the card nor a ballot, and said she wouldn’t put it past the party to “manufacture” one of them. After the Conservatives produced a copy of her membership record — also circulated online by Jenni Byrne, a senior adviser to Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre — Ms. Clark walked back her comments. “I misspoke,” she said in a statement posted to social media. “I have always been clear that I supported Jean Charest to stop Pierre Poilievre. Not backing away from that. “I’m thinking carefully about running because he still needs to be stopped. But if we want to do that, our party has to accept change. Sticking with the status quo is a losing strategy.” Ms. Clark had emerged as an early potential front-runner in the Liberal leadership contest to replace departing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, with other front-runners including former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney and former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Former Liberal environment minister Catherine McKenna, who is backing Mr. Carney, criticized Ms. Clark. “Dear Liberals: I can confirm that Christy Clark is a Conservative. Worse: She thinks politics is saying whatever is required to win,” Ms. McKenna wrote on social media. “The worst kind of politics.” In addition to her past political allegiances, Ms. Clark’s ability to speak French has also been scrutinized, with numerous senior Liberals noting that bilingualism is crucial for the job. The field of candidates is expected to narrow considerably in the coming days. Two high-profile potential contenders, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, said this week they won’t run, citing a desire to remain focused on their jobs and prepare Canada to manage the economic threats of the incoming U.S. president, Donald Trump. Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne is expected to announce his intentions within the next two days. The rules the Liberal party set could also winnow down the list of qualifiers: candidates must pay a $350,000 entry fee, a sum which could be prohibitive for some would-be candidates. Only two people have stated publicly they will try to mount a campaign: former Liberal MP and businessman Frank Baylis, and current Liberal MP Chandra Arya. Others considering a run: House Leader Karina Gould, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon.

"With an election approaching fast, developers worry about losing Liberal housing initiatives:   Developers hope for the continuation of several Liberal housing policies as Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has yet to put forward many specific ideas",2025.0,"Vancouver developer Beau Jarvis has intently studied a two-hour podcast interview given by federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, watching it twice through looking for clues as to what the would-be future prime minister might do for the housing industry. Mr. Jarvis is far from the only one. The federal Liberal government’s push in recent years to turbocharge new housing led to policies developers such as Mr. Jarvis, president and chief executive officer of Wesgroup Properties, have come to rely on: low-cost financing for building market rental apartments and social housing, the goods and services tax rebate on new rentals, and breaks for landlords on allowable tax writeoffs, among others. What the future of those programs is will be determined by a new government, but Mr. Poilievre has put forward few specific ideas so far beyond a suggestion that he’d eliminate the GST on homes costing less than $1-million. That’s left people who build condos, rental apartments and social housing wondering what will happen after a federal election that could be called within months. In the decade of then prime minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government between 2006 to 2015, Ottawa spent a yearly average of $2.3-billion on housing. Last year alone, it spent $11-billion, according to statistics from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. The figures indicate the speed with which the issue went from what housing analyst Steve Pomeroy described as Mr. Harper’s “mild disinterest” to one that now tops voters’ lists of urgent issues. Builders and housing analysts are hoping for a continuation of some of the Justin Trudeau-era housing policies they think worked, including direct grants for social housing and breaks for landlords on allowable capital-cost tax writeoffs. They’re mixed on whether the recent Liberal program that gave millions to cities to speed up permit processing and encourage more densification is worth saving. And they are advocating for more changes, ones that would reduce or eliminate the fees and taxes charged on new housing by cities and provinces and offer more cheap financing to build rental apartments. They also want a loosening of the rules to encourage more foreign investors to put their money into construction. As Toronto condo developer Brad Lamb puts it: “We just need them (governments) to stay out of the way and stop interfering in the marketplace.” In Vancouver, Wesgroup’s Mr. Jarvis, who’s also the president of the provincial Urban Development Institute, said he wants the next federal government to expand a program to provide apartment builders with more low-cost financing. The Liberals recently increased the amount available for what is now named the Apartment Loan Construction Program from $40-billion to $55-billion between 2017 and 2023. That financing has saved West Coast developers millions on projects and encouraged many of them to switch from condo projects to building rentals. B.C. developers have received a third of the $20-billion that has been allocated so far. In Toronto, the country’s largest developer of purpose-built rentals is also a fan of the financing loan program. Adrian Rocca, CEO of Fitzrovia Real Estate, said the major problem with the current apartment financing program is that it’s so popular, every year’s allotment gets taken within months. “It’s maxed out,” Mr. Rocca said. The Liberals’ elimination of the GST on rental projects also had an impact, he said. “It was a bold move,” said Mr. Rocca, whose company has 9,000 units under construction in the Toronto and Montreal metropolitan areas. But Mr. Rocca said there needs to be more. The presale condo market in Toronto is almost non-existent and rental construction is down by 70 to 80 per cent compared to three years ago, he said. Mr. Lamb added that the harmonized sales tax in Ontario is an impediment to faster, cheaper housing. The HST now amounts to 13 per cent of the purchase price of any house or condo. He noted it’s nearly impossible to make rentals work, since it costs $1,600 per square foot to build them, but top rents in standard new apartments are about $4 per square foot per month. “We need the HST to go away or the rebate to be greatly increased.” Development fees are another obstacle builders would like to see a new federal government tackle. The current Liberal government, especially under then housing minister Sean Fraser in 2023 and 2024, went on an aggressive campaign of providing millions of dollars to cities if they promised to increase the amount of housing allowed and stopped hiking fees charged to developers for the infrastructure necessary to sustain new developments. There has been no conclusive evidence on whether that Housing Accelerator Fund has been effective. Some cities have raised their fees anyway even after getting the money. “It’s not particularly well designed. There’s not a lot of oversight on whether cities are meeting the requirements,” said Mike Moffatt, an Ottawa-based economist who is chief executive at the Smart Prosperity Institute and a leading voice on housing and immigration. Two years ago, Mr. Poilievre proposed a private members’ bill that went nowhere that would have penalized cities that increase development fees by taking away federal money for infrastructure funding. Mr. Lamb and other developers also want a new federal government to get rid of policies meant to reduce or eliminate foreign investment. The vast majority of condo projects in Toronto and Vancouver over the past two decades have been possible because of the large number of foreign investors who have bought units through presales. “Our entire industry is based on selling condos to investors,” said Mr. Lamb. “No one local is lining up to buy a home for five years from now.” To bring back those needed investors, he said, the federal government should end programs that penalize or ban foreign investors, and eliminate the increase in capital gains taxes that the Liberal government introduced last year. Mr. Moffatt agrees. “I’d like to see the next federal government figure out how to attract foreign capital. We were using foreign investors as a scapegoat, but one of the things causing the big downturn in construction is some of this blocking of foreign investment.” It’s not known what a Conservative government might do about maintaining construction money for social housing. As housing minister, Sean Fraser had been in talks with B.C. officials about boosting infrastructure funding for new housing and money for renovating or replacing some of Vancouver’s crumbling stock of residential hotels that provide homes for some of the city’s poorest residents. Mr. Fraser’s departure as minister in December was a blow. “A lot of folks are wondering what happens next,” said B.C. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon. “That was the most hopeful I had felt about getting some concrete measures to improve housing.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Bula, Frances",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 11, 2025",Lessors; Federal government; Construction; Infrastructure; Rentals; Apartments; Prime ministers; Investors; Foreign investment; Writeoffs; Condominiums,,2025-01-11,The Globe and Mail
"Is it good for Pierre Poilievre if Donald Trump likes him - or is it very, very bad?:   In a recurring feature, Susan Delacourt, a small-l liberal, and Matt Gurney, a small-c conservative, bring their different perspectives - and shared commitment to civil disagreement - to the political debates of the moment.",2025.0,"Susan Delacourt: Any other week, Matt, we probably would have been talking about Justin Trudeau's resignation last Monday. But Donald Trump has walked all over that conversation with his threats to force Canada into a merger with the United States. I actually can't believe I just wrote that last sentence. So let's talk about what he has done to throw even more chaos into a chaotic political time for Canada. Matt Gurney: He's responded rationally to our weakness. I don't like what Trump's doing. I'd wish he'd stop. And I don't like what it tells us about the world that I'm not surprised at all by any of it. But that's my honest answer. He's sensed political weakness on our part, and since he's not the kind of guy who's bound by sentimentality or even just a traditional sense of how a U.S. president should behave, he's pouncing on us. It's awful. But it'll be our new reality until and unless he gets distracted. SD: I'll tell you what leaped out at me - something that hasn't been discussed as widely as his threats. It was when Trump, in a radio interview, finally acknowledged Pierre Poilievre as the next likely prime minister of Canada. It wasn't exactly an endorsement; in fact, Trump first said that the Conservative leader might not win. But then, this: ""It would be very good. Our views would be more aligned, certainly."" Something tells me that's not great news for Poilievre. MG: This will be a short reply, but ... why? I don't think it means anything for Poilievre. SD: Oh, I disagree. On the list of endorsements you don't want in Canada, I'd say one from Trump tops the list. MG: You know, I'm old enough to remember a time, and it wasn't that long ago, when a lot of otherwise smart Liberals pinned their hopes of some kind of polling turnaround on the idea that a Trump victory would scare Canadians back in line behind Trudeau. And then a funny thing happened - Trump won, and since then the Conservatives have gone up even more in the polls. Freeland bailed, and a tearful Trudeau has announced he'll bail, too - eventually. The poll aggregator 338Canada has the Conservatives with a majority so large that leftover Tories could themselves form the second-largest party in the House without dropping the CPC to a minority. I think we need to get to a national place of acceptance with the fact that an idle comment by Trump probably isn't going to knock 60 seats out of reach for Poilievre. SD: Hey, I'm old enough to remember when Justin Trudeau was planning on sticking around for the next election. Seriously, and I would say this, but no matter what the polls say, Canada is by and large a progressive country. And if Trump is going to kick off his next term by beating up on Canada, I firmly believe Canadians are going to be really ticked with him, very quickly. I think they may get really curious about what Trump means about being aligned with Poilievre. MG: I don't. I don't know if there is a single voter who is currently planning to vote for Poilievre who is going to change their mind because of something Trump says. And I especially don't think there are so many of those voters out there that they are going to form a critical mass in enough ridings to matter. Again, the only careers in Canadian politics that have been negatively affected by Trump's reelection thus far have been the Liberal now-outgoing prime minister and the Liberal former deputy prime minister. SD: So, I don't think I've asked you this before, but how do you think Poilievre would fare against Trump, especially this belligerent one? MG: I've spent a good long few minutes staring at that question, and I admit I have no idea how to answer it. I don't think it's possible to answer. Do we mean politically? I think he'll ""fare"" fine against Trump. When Poilievre eventually loses, it'll be because of domestic stuff, as ever. I think Trump will cause headaches and probably outright nightmares for a Poilievre government, as he has for the Trudeau one. I'm not trying to give a vague answer, I just don't even know how to begin to approach the question. SD: You don't have to get used to that question, but Poilievre had better. I would really like to know what he would do when Trump starts goading and teasing him. Say what you like about Trudeau - and God knows, everyone is - he had remarkable self-discipline in dealing with the taunts, gained from a lifetime of experience. Poilievre has a tendency to be thin-skinned and to double down on the outrageous. These aren't good skills for dealing with Trump. MG: Well, OK, but that's a different question. ""What he'll do"" is easier to answer than how he'll fare - I dunno how well any of us are going to fare! We already see signs of it. He'll ignore as much as he can and respond with a forceful statement when he has to. He'll probably do as Trudeau did and lean on members of his caucus or staff with ties to the U.S. to work the back channels. I don't know if that'll be enough - I don't know if it could ever be enough - but I think that's what'll happen. SD: Agreed. But I think Poilievre is quickly going to realize he has a new, more formidable rival now, and that's not the person who succeeds Trudeau. It's Trump, and this is a whole different fight for the Conservatives. He can't keep rambling on about how Trudeau got us into this mess with Trump. Because I'm a loyal Canadian, I wish Poilievre well if he does end up being the man to handle this chaos. But I hope it makes the Conservative leader stop trash-talking Canada in the face of these Trump insults. That would be one tiny silver lining in what is looking like an even crazier time for Canadian politics in the coming weeks. MG: I think Poilievre has been better at sensing both opportunity and danger than the prime minister has been in a long time. That'll wear off as he spends time in office. It always does. I hope it lasts long enough. Maybe until the midterms? Susan Delacourt is an Ottawa-based columnist for the Star, where she has been covering politics on Parliament Hill since the late 1980s.

Christy Clark preparing to announce bid for Liberal leadership: 'we're ready to go',2025.0,"OTTAWA - Former British Columbia premier Christy Clark is preparing to announce she is running as a candidate in the federal Liberal leadership race, once the rules are finalized. ""Unless the party has some crazy rules, I'm expecting we're going to be in this and we're going to win it,"" Tyler Banham, a member of Clark's national campaign to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the next Liberal leader, told National Post in an interview Thursday. Before making any final decision, Clark is among several leadership hopefuls waiting to see what the party decides in terms of rules for the upcoming race, which include timelines, the cut-off date for membership eligibility and entry fees. The national board was set to meet on Thursday to discuss the requirements after party officials fielded ideas from Liberal MPs during a marathon caucus meeting the day before.

This week, Clark held a call with 135 national organizers from across the country which hailed from all but two territories and one province, according to a source close to her, and is also receiving offers from people to assist with fundraising. The source added she has been preparing for months, travelling the country, including heading to Quebec to improve her ability to speak French. ""Depending on how the rules are, she's going to run,"" said Banham, the former president of the party's Ontario wing. ""We've ramped up really quickly. When they say, 'go', we're ready to go.

Her skills are likely to come in handy with the federal Liberal party which, after nearly a decade in power under Trudeau, has suffered an exodus of supporters and candidates and is performing dismally in national polls. Clark's team said she understands the party needs to be rebuilt. ""Depending on how we do in the next election we're going to need help rebuilding,"" Banham said. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been sharpening his attacks against those who could succeed Trudeau. During a press conference on Thursday, he took shots at former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, former banker Mark Carney but also the former B.C. premier, referring to her as ""Carbon Tax Clark,"" for having supported B.C.'s provincial carbon tax, which a B.C. Liberal government introduced in 2008. ""She was the 'carbon tax queen' before Justin Trudeau even got the idea. In fact, she might even have been the inspiration,"" said Poilievre. Clark will raise the profile of a leadership race that in its early days has had only lesser-known candidates confirm their entry. Liberal MP Chandra Arya announced Thursday he is willing to throw his hat in the ring, making him the second unofficial contender seeking to lead the party after former Liberal MP and businessman Frank Baylis. ""I'm running to be the next prime minister of Canada to lead a small, more efficient government, to rebuild our nation and secure prosperity for future generations,"" said Arya, in a video posted on X. Arya, the MP for the Ottawa-area riding of Nepean since 2015, is the first leadership hopeful to officially promise to scrap the Liberals' consumer carbon tax. Arya's other promises include immediately recognizing a Palestinian state and severing Canada's ties with the monarchy by making it a ""sovereign republic."" Just last month, the MP for Nepean signalled his support for Freeland after she resigned as finance minister from Trudeau's cabinet. Calling her a ""credible and stable alternative"" to Trudeau, he said she was best placed to deal with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. Arya said Thursday that he reflected over the holidays and came to the conclusion that he, not Freeland, would be better suited to lead the party. Freeland has not yet said if she is going to take a run at the leadership. A source close to her said she wanted to talk to her caucus colleagues this week and ""discuss what are the next best steps for both the party and the country."" Arya said he did not talk to any of his colleagues before making the announcement nor will he be asking any of them to endorse him. ""I'm directly going to the people,"" he said. Baylis was MP for Pierrefonds-Dollard in the Montreal area, considered one of the safest ridings in the country, from 2015 to 2019, before he decided not to run again. He is the executive chairman of Baylis Medical Tech, a company he sold to an American firm in 2022 for close to US$2 billion.

She is also a respected campaigner and someone who can help build a party, as she did with the B.C. Liberals, which went on to form a government Clark led from 2011 until 2017. Those skills are likely to come in handy should she enter the race to lead the Liberal party which, after nearly a decade in power under Trudeau and amid historically low polling numbers, appears headed in the direction of rebuilding. Clark is looking to enter the race under no delusions of the fact that needs to happen. ""Depending on how we do in the next election we're going to need help rebuilding,"" Banham said. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been sharpening his attacks against those who could succeed Trudeau. During a press conference on Thursday, he took shots at former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, former banker Mark Carney but also the former B.C. premier, referring to her as ""Carbon Tax Clark."" ""She was the 'carbon tax queen' before Justin Trudeau even got the idea. In fact, she might even have been the inspiration,"" said Poilievre. Ontario Premier Doug Ford's team has similarly dubbed Ontario Liberal leader Bonnie Crombie as the ""queen of the carbon tax,"" even though Crombie has promised not to introduce a provincial carbon tax as part of her climate election platform. Meanwhile, other lesser-known politicians are vying for the federal Liberal leadership race. Liberal MP Chandra Arya announced Thursday he is willing to throw his hat in the ring - much to the surprise of many Liberals. That makes him the second unofficial contender seeking to lead the party, after former Liberal MP and businessman Frank Baylis. ""I'm running to be the next prime minister of Canada to lead a small, more efficient government, to rebuild our nation and secure prosperity for future generations,"" said Arya, in a video posted on X. Arya, the MP for the riding of Nepean in Ottawa since 2015, is the first leadership hopeful to officially promise to scrap the consumer carbon tax. Baylis said he is not fully ""married"" to an idea of the carbon tax, but thinks polluting the air should come at a cost. Arya's other promises include immediately recognizing Palestine as a sovereign state and severing Canada's ties with the monarchy by making it a ""sovereign republic."" Just last month, the MP for Nepean signalled his support for Freeland after she resigned as finance minister from Trudeau's cabinet. Calling her a ""credible and stable alternative"" to Trudeau, he said she was best placed to deal with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. ""Chrystia's approach - polite yet firm - has demonstrated her capacity to stand up to even the most intimidating personalities, embodying the strength of an iron fist in a velvet glove,"" he wrote in a letter shared on X on Dec. 20. In an interview, Arya explained that he reflected over the holidays and came to the conclusion that he, not Freeland, would be better suited to lead the party. Freeland has not yet said if she is going to take a run at the leadership. A source close to her said she wanted to talk to her caucus colleagues this week and ""discuss what are the next best steps for both the party and the country."" Arya said he did not talk to any of his colleagues before making the announcement nor will he be asking any of them to endorse him. ""I'm directly going to the people,"" he said. Baylis was MP for Pierrefonds-Dollard, considered one of the safest ridings in the country, from 2015 to 2019, before deciding not to run again. He is the executive chairman of Baylis Medical Tech, a company he sold to an American firm in 2022 for close to US$2 billion. ""I'm not saying that the polls aren't looking difficult for Liberals right now, but I'm very optimistic about the party and where we can take it,"" he said in an interview. A source close to Baylis said he has a growing team of supporters in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Nova Scotia - a mix of longtime Liberals and young people. ""There are people who feel like his experience taking a family business in Canada to global success is a signal of ability to lead people, teams and create growth opportunities for Canadians,"" the source said. The return to the political centre and scrapping the consumer carbon tax are only some of the issues that Liberal MPs told the National Post they would like to see with a new leader. Many caucus members were hoping that Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc would be that candidate, but he disappointed many of them Wednesday by saying that he will not be seeking to replace Trudeau to instead focus on the imminent threat of U.S. tariffs. Charlottetown Liberal MP Sean Casey said he had planned to support LeBlanc, before he bowed out from the race. While Casey hopes he reconsiders, he doubts the chances of it happening. ""Dominic's a thoughtful guy who clearly would have considered all the options."" ""So yes, I would like him to reconsider. Do I think he will? No."" In terms of his next pick, Casey said he's interested in the prospective candidacy of Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon. Not only does he have two decades of experience in politics, Casey said the Gatineau MP is fluently bilingual and ""speaks as a real person"" while also being able to handle the attacks lobbed by Poilievre. ""The fact that he's an east coaster is also appealing."" François-Philippe Champagne, Mélanie Joly, Jonathan Wilkinson and Karina Gould are among members of cabinet mulling over a decision. Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney is also expected to announce his decision shortly.

Former Redblacks head coach Rick Campbell returns to Ottawa as special teams coordinator,2025.0,"Rick Campbell is back in red and black. The Ottawa Redblacks announced Thursday morning that Campbell, their first head coach, has returned to the capital as the CFL club's special teams coordinator. Campbell, 54, guided Ottawa to three Grey Cups in his six seasons (2014-2019) as the sideline boss - including its championship win in Year 3. For the past four years, he has served as head coach and co-GM of the B.C. Lions, who fired him after last season's 9-9 finish. To borrow the title of a Justin Timberlake song, What Goes Around Comes Around. In 2016, Campbell hired Bob Dyce as the Redblacks special teams coordinator. Nine years later, Dyce has returned the favour. ""Throughout our time working together, and coaching against each other, Rick has demonstrated what it means to be a leader of men,"" Dyce, now the Redbacks head coach, said Thursday. ""His experience coaching all phases of the game will be a tremendous asset to our football club, and we're extremely pleased to welcome him back to Ottawa."" The position of special teams coordinator became vacant last week when Cory McDiarmid made a lateral move for the same job with the Lions. Before the Redblacks announced they had hired Will Fields as their defensive coordinator last week, there was speculation that Campbell would be a good fit in that role, which he previously held in both Calgary and Edmonton. But insiders felt that Campbell was going to take the coming CFL season to catch his breath and evaluate all of his options. Clearly, he didn't want to step away from the game. ""It feels like coming home,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""Ottawa is a special place and I'm looking forward to getting to work and competing for the Grey Cup in 2025."" Campbell is the son of the legendary Hugh Campbell, who coached the Edmonton Eskimos to five consecutive Grey Cup wins from 1978-82.

He was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2004, and after four seasons became the Winnipeg Blue Bombers' DB coach/special teams coordinator for one year., From there, he was the Stampeders running backs coach in 2010, Edmonton's assistant head coach/special teams coordinator in 2011 and Calgary's defensive coordinator in 2012 and 2013.

Did Stephen Harper just respond to Donald Trump's 51st U.S. state threat?,2025.0,"In the face of repeated economic provocations and talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state from president-elect Donald Trump, some prominent Conservatives on this side of the border aren't exactly rolling out the welcome mat. While he didn't reference any of the Republican's threats of tariffs or the repeated jabs about absorbing our sovereign nation, former prime minister Stephen Harper appears to have subtly weighed in on the debate in a timely post to X on Wednesday evening. Elizabeth May proposes California, Oregon, Washington join Canada after Trump's 51st state threat The founding leader of the Conservative Party of Canada (2004), who led the nation for nearly 10 years (2006-2015), shared a party ad from 2011 featuring one of his speeches set over various images and videos portraying the country and its people. ""True when I said it, true today,"" Harper wrote and shared the transcript of his speech in which he espouses Canada's strength and freedom as the reasons its people are proud to call this land home. ""Canada is, and always has been, our country. And we want Canada to be a True North that is as strong and as free as it can be in every way that matters: the best country in the world.

Earlier Wednesday, Conservative Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who's been vocal in response to the threats and merger rhetoric, again pitched his Fortress Am-Can idea, a new trade deal benefiting both nations' security and bottom line.

""Let's stop wasting time and ridiculous ideas about merging and instead focus on efforts on restoring the pride of Made in Canada and Made in USA,"" he told reporters at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station.

""This approach will ensure we can act quickly and be coordinated in our approach,"" Ford, the council chair, wrote. Following the meeting, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the council, recognizing any tariffs would affect each province differently, is ""united and steadfast"" in opposing them, per a statement sent to the National Post.

Former colleagues say Christy Clark shouldn't be underestimated in federal Liberal leadership race,2025.0,"Former B.C. premier Christy Clark has been preparing for months to take a run at being the next federal Liberal leader and could announce her intentions any day now, former colleagues say. They believe that her outsider status as well as her past history of uniting a fractured caucus may give her a legitimate shot at becoming Canada's next prime minister after Justin Trudeau announced his intention to resign Monday. Most polls have Clark falling behind already established cabinet ministers such as ex-finance minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Transportation Minister Anita Anand, and Innovation and Science and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne. Former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney has also been much-touted as an outsider candidate, while current Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc was viewed as a potential front-runner until he announced Tuesday he wouldn't be putting his name forward. ""I think she certainly has the potential to be a dark horse in the race,"" said Stephen Smart, general manager of Hill & Knowlton Western Canada and a former press secretary to Clark. ""I really think those who might dismiss her in this race out of the gate really do so at their own peril. She builds great teams around her. She has the potential to really get people on-board. She has been a member of the Liberal Party of Canada for a very long time."" While remembered in her home province as the leader of a party, the B.C. Liberals, that represented a coalition of federal Liberals and Conservatives, Clark has been consistent about where her loyalty lies when it comes to the federal stage. A member of the Young Liberals during her time at Simon Fraser University in the 1980s, Clark came by her affiliation with the party honestly as her father, Jim, had run provincially three times for the party when it was still connected to the federal brand. His daughter later joined with Gordon Wilson and others to give the provincial Liberals their independence in the lead-up to the 1991 election, but has spoken about her continuing affinity for the federal party often in the decades since. Clark also served as a staffer in the Jean Chretien administration, where she worked beside LeBlanc. The pair have remained close friends in the years since. Mike Bernier, former B.C. Liberal MLA for Peace River South, says one of the main strengths Clark brings to the table, having been the education minister for the final two years of her government, is her charisma and ability to bring people together. This will be important if she steps in as the new leader of a deeply divided federal Liberal caucus, a situation similar to the one she inherited when taking over from Gordon Campbell as leader of the provincial government in 2011. ""Christy has more charisma as almost anybody I've ever met, she has an ability when she walks in the room, you can just feel that aura,"" said Bernier. ""Others might come in with a policy or a business background. Christy puts the smart people around her, meaning she doesn't have to be the person with all of those skill sets. Her idea is just to get people excited, how to get people to be part of something."" Bernier says Clark's more conservative credentials from her time in politics could be a help as he said there remain many people in Conservative ridings such as his that hold very favourable opinions of Clark due to her focus on blue-collar issues such as resource development while serving as premier. Also of help is her frequent criticisms of Trudeau, ranging from his purchase of the Trans-Mountain Pipeline in 2018 to his refusal to resign this summer following a shocking defeat in the Toronto-St. Paul's byelection. ""I never thought there would be a prime minister in this country who would be deciding that the things that Canadians say, as long as it's not hate speech, are unacceptable,"" she said in 2022 after endorsing Jean Charest for federal Conservative leader. ""Implicit in his handling of the truckers' convoy was this message: 'If you don't agree with me ... you're a bad person, and if you do agree with me, you're a good person.' "" Those close to Clark are divided on whether a short or long race would be more beneficial to her. While a short race would limit the amount of money she would have to spend, a longer race would give her more time to sign up new members to support her. The former premier's longtime finance minister, Mike de Jong, said that the problem for Clark if she is elected is that she will be in charge of a party that is supremely unpopular and is expected to get wiped out of government by the federal Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre. De Jong, who will be running for the Tories, likened the Liberals to ""replacing the captain of the Titanic 20 minutes after it's struck the iceberg."" ""The ship is sinking and any member of the crew that hasn't already jumped overboard, along with the new captain (whoever that is), will be held responsible for the mess they've created,"" said de Jong, while acknowledging that he would never ""underestimate Christy Clark's political abilities."" B.C. Conservative Leader John Rustad, who also served as a cabinet minister in Clark's government, agreed with de Jong. He said that, despite his respect for his former boss, he will be supporting Poilievre in the upcoming election. ""I enjoyed my time working with Christie. I have a lot of respect for her as premier. If she's going to go after the leadership of the federal Liberal party, I'm really not gonna have much to say about that,"" said Rustad. ""My perspective, though, is that we need significant political change. We need to bring some common sense back to this country. We need to get rid of things like the carbon tax. And so I only see one path forward with that, and that is with the current federal Conservative party."" Related Who's next?

Michael Taube: Poilievre needs to think big when it comes to Trump,2025.0,"Donald Trump will become U.S. President on Jan. 20. He's already given some indication of what he's thinking of doing when he returns to the White House. It may be bluster, and it may never materialize, but the next Liberal Prime Minister - and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who seems destined to become PM - must be prepared to deal with it. The President-elect went on a tear at a press conference yesterday. He mused about changing the Gulf of Mexico's name to Gulf of America, which he suggested had a ""beautiful ring"" to it. He didn't discount military action to take control of Greenland and the Panama Canal, believing the U.S. needs them ""for economic security."" Trump's belief that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state was also addressed. Even though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is finally on his way out, and the endless jokes about him becoming ""governor"" are nearly done, Trump's position seems to be the same. Trump was asked about Poilievre's post on X, in which he called the U.S. our country's ""best friend"" but noted ""Canada will never be the 51st state. Period."" He scoffed at this and said, ""That's all right. Maybe he won't win, but maybe he will. I don't care."" When asked if he was going to use military force to annex Canada, he replied, ""No, economic force. Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security. Again, we basically protect Canada."" Trudeau, a lame duck Prime Minister, remains at the helm. He's already pushed back, but it's completely meaningless. Trump has no time, interest or respect for Trudeau. The next Liberal PM will be in the same boat, tainted by the foul stench of Trudeau's feeble leadership. He or she will try to put a fresh coat of paint on the weathered Liberal government, but it's going to quickly peel away. Poilievre needs to focus squarely on both points. Unlike Trudeau, who didn't have the ability to deal with Trump, the Conservative leader is a far superior politician with exceptional communications skills. He has a strong personality, intelligent ideas, and clear direction for Canada in the present and future. What about Trump's dismissive attitude? It's just political trash-talking. He privately knows, or has been advised, that Poilievre has been way ahead in the polls for years. In spite of what he said, he's aware that Poilievre is a different political animal who's likely going to win, and he'll have to work around him. What does Poilievre have to do to successfully work with an unconventional leader like Trump? To negotiate with Trump, you have to negotiate like Trump. The President-elect will reportedly implement the 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian products after he's been inaugurated. Hence, Poilievre needs to craft a similar formula about business deals and strategies that Trump and Tony Schwartz posited in The Art of the Deal. ""I like thinking big. I always have,"" Trump wrote in one chapter. ""To me it's very simple: If you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big."" Here's how Poilievre can think big. He needs to keep defending and protecting Canadian sovereignty and independence, but work with Trump to improve border security and safety. That's always been Trump's main beef with Canada and Mexico. ""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!,"" he wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 25, 2024. Poilievre, like Trump, also believes in stronger border safety and security. That's a way to find common ground without him giving up an inch of political ground. Poilievre shouldn't get too worked up about the Canada-51st U.S. state taunt. It's a tactic to get under people's skin, and Trump is a master of it. Instead, propose sensible ways to improve economic relations between our two countries and suggest appealing free market-oriented ideas. Some possibilities include eliminating supply management in the dairy industry, reducing foreign ownership restrictions and working towards a strong economic union. He also needs to show good faith and a willingness to work hand-in-hand with Trump. Not by giving in to every demand, but recognizing there are gaps that need to be addressed with a common sense approach. This will hopefully lead to either a gradual reduction or complete elimination of the tariff rate for agreeing to move forward and much further than Trudeau ever proposed. Above all, Poilievre can't lose patience with Trump. Some Canadian pundits and commentators believe we should tell Trump to take a hike. That's the worst tactic he can take. Poilievre is a passionate and determined individual, which are good personality traits, but he must stay focused on the task at hand. Trump will keep pushing his buttons to find a breaking point like he did with Trudeau. Poilievre can't ever give him the opportunity to believe he's achieved this. Otherwise, it could lead to a years-long trade war that could wreck the Canadian economy. Poilievre's key to success will be being proactive rather than reactive in dealing with Trump. If he becomes Prime Minister, I strongly believe he can achieve this.

Poilievre mistakes decent for radical,2025.0,"In Conservative Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre's extensive conversation with his go-to guru, Jordan Petersen, he describes Justin Trudeau as ""extremely radical."" Well, I should say so. The Liberal government was actually helping people who needed help, instead of padding the pockets of large political donors who don't. What a radical concept! In that context, Jesus Christ was also ""extremely radical"" - loaves and fish, indeed. It's not a concept any Conservative government could be accused of. Where's the ""trickle -down"" effect? Now, as then, there is a frightening complacency within the citizenry that seems more influenced by conspiracy theories.

Poilievre is playing into Trump's hands,2025.0,"If your next-door neighbour leaned over the fence and said he wanted your yard, you'd conclude he was obnoxious, crazed and menacing. You'd know, however, that if he took any action, you could call the police. But it's different when it's Donald Trump leaning over the border and talking about making your country his 51st state. There's no one to call. The U.S. president-elect is obnoxious, crazed and menacing, but he's got the world's biggest nuclear arsenal. Or will soon. We're stuck with the poor choice Americans made. But it's infuriating the way Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre prepares the ground for that snarling bully by constantly squawking that Canada is broken. In a year-end interview with CTV, Poilievre whined about Canada's ""idiotic socialist economic policies"" and the gap between Canadian and American GDP. This is the perfect setup for Trump's claim that ""many Canadians want to become the 51st state."" What Trump doesn't tell us - and neither does Poilievre - is that Canada does much better than the U.S. on measures that, by any logic, matter more than GDP. For instance, Canada's child poverty rate is 9.2 per cent, while the U.S. rate is double that - 18.6 per cent, according to the OECD. Let's be clear: Canada has much less child poverty because of programs that Poilievre dismisses as ""idiotic socialist economic policies"" - like our far more generous child tax credit. If Poilievre, as prime minister, were to reduce that benefit to U.S. levels, our child poverty rate would rise like theirs, pushing about 725,000 more Canadian children (and their parents) into poverty. Yet, in a recent interview with right-wing guru Jordan Peterson, Poilievre insisted that redistributionist policies - presumably like the child tax credit - actually take money from the working class and deliver it to the super-rich. Huh? How so? He also said that such government ""help"" is ""the sunny side of control."" Again, how so? I guess it's too much to expect a fellow right-wing flake like Peterson to force Poilievre to explain himself, to ask Poilievre the obvious question: Are families worse off because of the child tax credit, which gives them cash, enabling them to buy cribs, diapers, food? The OECD numbers also show that Canadian children score higher in literacy, numeracy and problem-solving than American children and that our infant mortality rate is lower - reflecting our stronger public education and health care systems. More odious control? True, Canada's GDP per capita is lower than America's. But that doesn't mean ordinary Americans are better-off than ordinary Canadians. It simply means that some exceptionally wealthy U.S. billionaires, like Elon Musk, skew the national average. If Musk were to move to Canada, our GDP per capita would rise slightly, but we wouldn't be any better off. (We'd be worse off, having to put up with that clown canoodling with neo-Nazis here and jumping around hysterically on our political stages.) Fortunately, inequality is less extreme in Canada. Our top one per cent have 17 per cent of the nation's wealth; America's top one per cent have a staggering 37 per cent! Trump sees Canadians as his to play with. He was quick to take credit for Justin Trudeau's resignation this week, while threatening ""economic force"" to convince Canada to join the U.S., and ruminating about invading Greenland and Panama. Poilievre is trying to pitch himself as someone who will stand up to Trump: ""I will put Canada first."" Poilievre's actual strategy is to give the bully what he wants - more military spending and more acquiescence to U.S. business interests. If Poilievre were to open up our health care more to private U.S. hospitals and Big Pharma and trash our climate laws to please Big Oil, then Trump wouldn't have to formally annex Canada. We'd already be the 51st state, in the ways he cares about. No wonder Elon Musk has given Poilievre the thumbs-up. Poilievre spouts the kind of ""Canada first"" policy that U.S. billionaires can really get behind. Linda McQuaig is an author, journalist and a freelance contributing columnist for The Star.

Spike in counterfeit bills hits Prince George: RCMP Mounties are warning people about a rash of counterfeit bills hitting stores and businesses in Prince George. On Wednesday, police issued a warning to businesses who handle cash transactions to pay attention to the bills they're receiving after a dramatic rise in counterfeit bill reports. Usually, the detachment would get one or two reports of counterfeit bills a month, said Cpl. Jennifer Cooper of Prince George RCMP. ""Since Dec. 1, we have received 17 reports, so that's quite a spike in counterfeit bills going around the city,"" she said. ""It is predominantly $20 and $50 bills we are seeing used."" Police issued photographs of the fake bills to help merchants identify the counterfeit money in circulation. Some of the bills appeared to be fake cash that could be used in a classroom setting, said police, while others were photocopied bills printed on paper. Prince George RCMP shared this image of the back of counterfeit $20 bills. The Bank of Canada asks anyone who suspects they're being offered a counterfeit bill to politely refuse the note, ask for another note and check it and advise the person to check the note with local police. It's a criminal offence to knowingly use or keep counterfeit money.

"Legal woes mount amid property empire collapse:   In addition to mounting claims in civil court, a team of investigators has been interviewing lenders and investors who loaned money to companies controlled by Robby Clark and his primary mo rtgage broker and promissory note vendor",2025.0,"Legal challenges continue to mount for associates of a child actor who bought hundreds of homes across Ontario using more than $144-million in private mortgage debt and risky promissory notes before crashing into insolvency one year ago. In addition to mounting claims in civil court, The Globe and Mail has learned a team of investigators of the Ontario Provincial Police Anti-Rackets Branch has for weeks now been interviewing lenders and investors who lent money to companies controlled by Robby Clark and his primary mortgage broker and promissory note vendor Claire Drage. Several lenders who spoke to The Globe said the OPP probe is seeking documents and information related to allegations of potential criminal fraud raised in civil court filings. None of the allegations have been proven in court. On Jan. 23, 2024, a collection of companies connected to Mr. Clark filed for insolvency protection to reorganize a rental property portfolio of more than 400 homes spread mainly across the Northern Ontario cities of Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie and Timmins. After a year of legal wrangling, as of December, 2024, the majority of those properties have been transferred out of Clark’s companies to the private mortgage lenders who were allowed to convert the money owed to them to purchases in a credit bid process approved by Ontario Superior Court. “The OPP Anti-Rackets Branch has an ongoing and active investigation,” said Gosia Puzio, with the OPP corporate communications bureau. “Further information cannot be provided at this time to protect the integrity of the investigation and any possible future court proceedings.” On Dec. 20, a court-ordered stay of proceedings that had shielded Mr. Clark and several colleagues – including his wife Aruba Butt, business partner Dylan Suitor and long-time friend Ryan Maloney – from further civil claims was lifted by the court. Ms. Drage, who had not been covered by the stay of proceedings but whose companies filed for a separate bankruptcy in April, 2024, is also facing more than $250-million in civil damages claims from two separate lawsuits, one of which accuses her of running “a fraudulent Ponzi scheme” and the mortgage brokerage company that formerly employed her – Mortgage Alliance Company of Canada Inc. – of negligence, breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. “It’s a multiplaintiff claim, we represent at last count 436 individuals,” said David Milosevic, of Milosevic & Associates, who is representing many of the lenders who were stung by the collapse of Mr. Clark and Ms. Drage’s businesses. “We do a lot of multiparty investment loss cases. … We put out the word we were interested in the file and hundreds of people dove in.” Mortgage Alliance is both provincially and federally regulated financial services company and the largest arm of Montreal-based privately held M3 Financial Group. M3 claims to have $65-billion in funded loans and more than 8,500 mortgage brokers across Canada. “Mortgage Alliance failed to supervise brokers, including Claire Drage, authorized to deal or trade in mortgages on its behalf, allowed the brokers to engage in fraudulent and dishonest conduct, and profited from such conduct,” the claim states. “Generally mortgage investment scams – and we’ve worked on a number of them – always involve an intermediary between the lender and the borrower who failed to administer the mortgages the way the paper says,” said Paul Bates, a lawyer working with Mr. Milosevic, who stressed he wasn’t drawing conclusions about what happened in this case. “They mingle funds, they are always spinning the plates and trying to keep the balls in the air. To the investor, it looks like a safe and sound investment, but the monies aren’t being used the way the paper says.” An unusual court-ordered investigation into the conduct of Mr. Clark’s companies carried out by the insolvency experts at KSV Consulting Inc. found examples of millions of dollars borrowed from lenders that were transferred from the insolvent companies with little or no accounting, lavish spending on corporate travel, entertaining or gifts and in some cases allegations that funds borrowed by Ms. Drage were used not for real estate investing but simply to pay overdue interest to other lenders. Mr. Milosevic’s claim describes how for each of the hundreds of private mortgages Ms. Drage arranged for Mr. Clark’s development companies “fees were sent directly to Mortgages Alliance” which then “transferred the fees to Drage (or her companies), less 5 per cent, which Mortgage Alliance withheld as its own profit.” According to the claim, Ms. Drage’s company Windrose was so closely tied to Mortgage Alliance that it didn’t have its own corporate bank account until 2022 – more than three years after the lending spree with Mr. Clark began – and “relied solely on Mortgage Alliance to handle its funds.” Natalie Leon, partner with Forbes, Chochla and Leon LLP, is defending Mortgage Alliance against the Milosevic action said in an e-mailed statement that “Mortgage Alliance denies any responsibility for the investors’ losses and is now defending those claims in court.” Ms. Leon did offer further context for claims relating to promissory note loans that Ms. Drage arranged, which are not regulated under Ontario’s Mortgage Brokerages, Lenders and Administrators Act, but rather under Canadian securities laws which falls to the Ontario Securities Commission in this case. “Mortgage Alliance is aware of certain claims being made by some investors associated with Claire Drage and her independent business known as Lion’s Share,” Ms. Leon’s statement reads. “The investors were apparently attracted to potential profits through high-interest, high-risk lending schemes not related to Mortgage Alliance that ultimately were unsuccessful. Some of those investors are now looking to others not involved in those affairs to shift their losses.” A separate civil case brought against Mortgage Alliance by Simon Bieber of Adair Goldblatt Bieber LLP alleges many of the same facts and represents approximately 150 plaintiffs seeking more than $100-million in damages. According to Mr. Milosevic, evidence turned up in a securities or criminal fraud investigation or trial could add to the case for his clients, but he isn’t waiting for the police to finish their work. “Unfortunately, the OSC is overwhelmed; our criminal prosecution system is overwhelmed,” he said. “I do fraud cases for a living. I have on average 40 people who call me a week; they are losing their homes. It’s an absolute epidemic and the police can’t do anything about it. I’m not pointing fingers or laying blame, it is just rampant victimization of Canadians and it’s terrible.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Dingman, Shane",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 8, 2025",Mortgages; Insolvency; Stock brokers; Criminal investigations; Breach of contract; Investors; Fraud,,2025-01-08,The Globe and Mail
Would Pierre Poilievre be better at protecting Canada from Donald Trump?,2025.0,"Contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail Pierre Poilievre won’t be able to manage Donald Trump, either. In one fell swoop, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation announcement, the pending Liberal leadership race, the prorogation of Parliament and the near guarantee that there will be a federal election this spring have catapulted Canada into a political transition at a challenging moment. With president-elect Donald Trump poised to take over the Oval Office on Jan. 20 and promising a barrage of executive orders on “day one,” the Prime Minister’s Office will be in a weakened position to protect Canadian interests currently held hostage by the crossfire of Mr. Trump’s agenda. This vulnerability comes at a particularly fraught time in Canada-U.S. relations. Mr. Trump’s provocations that Canada is commensurate to (and should become an) American state should not be taken lightly. Mr. Trump’s recent jabs at Mr. Trudeau, referring to him as the “Governor” of the “Great State of Canada,” are clearly an attempt to troll the current Prime Minister. Relations between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump have never been a cause for great concern, but neither have they been close or even collegial. These declarations about Canadian statehood are both classic Trumpian ignominy and his way of emphasizing what he sees as a clear power imbalance between the two countries. Amid the uncertainty of the resetting of both Canadian and American political landscapes, will Mr. Trudeau’s resignation revitalize Canada’s chance of repositioning itself in Mr. Trump’s good graces? It’s doubtful. Mr. Trudeau has served as a rhetorical foil and fodder for Mr. Trump over the years. The stark contrast between the two leaders was immediately apparent. In 2015, Mr. Trudeau gloated about his groundbreaking commitment to gender parity in his first cabinet, and less than a year later, Mr. Trump’s first presidential campaign was marred by allegations of sexual predation. And, of course, the Liberal Party of Canada and American Republicans sit worlds apart in ideological terms. Even centrist Democrats often land to the right of Canadian conservatives on many social issues. While it’s not a foregone conclusion that Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will become the next prime minister, the polls suggest that it’s likely. Mr. Poilievre and the Conservative Party have been careful not to overtly ride the coattails of Mr. Trump’s victory in the United States; doing so would alienate those Canadians who are appalled by Mr. Trump’s return to power but who also want to see an end to the nineyear reign of Mr. Trudeau. But the Trumpian political ambitions of Mr. Poilievre are obvious. Mr. Poilievre frequently uses the same populist rhetoric as Mr. Trump, casting himself – a career politician with, literally, no other relevant job experience other than in Parliament – as a victim of political elites and the establishment. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Poilievre hurls insults at his political opponents, claims to defend the common people, exhibits disdain for expertise, sees identity politics as ubiquitous, recent and divisive (except when it comes to Quebec – that would be political suicide), and sees the media not as the guardrails of democracy, but as unworthy adversaries who question and might thwart his pursuit of power. However, Mr. Poilievre’s Trump-like tendencies do not matter to Mr. Trump and will not benefit Canada-United States relations in the short or long term. Mr. Trump does not care about the Liberal leadership race and will not be persuaded to ease tariffs against Canada when Mr. Trudeau is no longer the prime minister. He will not change his position on securing the border once the Conservatives win the next election. Mr. Trump cannot be managed from within or abroad. Ideology is inconsequential to him. The only thing that matters to Mr. Trump is fealty. Mr. Trump responded to Mr. Trudeau’s resignation by suggesting on social media, yet again, that Canada become the 51st American state. It’s an absurd proposition. No Canadian political party leader in their right mind would sign on to that messaging. This is even more the case for Mr. Poilievre and the Conservative Party, who have reinvented their brand as true, loyal, proudly unhyphenated Canadians. As Liberal leadership contenders fight it out and Canada barrels toward an election that will likely result in a new governing party or coalition, the challenge will not be placating Mr. Trump – an inadvisable and impossible task – but rather protecting Canadian political and economic interests in an era bound to be marked by increasing American volatility. Mr. Poilievre may borrow from Mr. Trump’s populist playbook, but he, like any Canadian leader, must ultimately answer to a political culture that values stability over chaos, compromise over confrontation and most importantly, its hard-won sovereignty over any foreign influence, whether invited or imposed.

"Poilievre would be as bad for Quebec as Trudeau has been, PQ leader says",2025.0,"QUEBEC - While describing Justin Trudeau as one of the worst prime ministers in history because of the way he has treated Quebec, the leader of the Parti Québécois said Tuesday that the potential winner of the next election isn't any better. Paul St-Pierre Plamondon said that if Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre becomes prime minister, he will govern by putting the interests of his voter base in the West and Ontario first, leaving Quebec out in the cold in much the same way Trudeau has. ""Pierre Poilievre will govern based on the interests and concerns of the Canadian West,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said at his first news conference of 2025. ""He doesn't need Quebec to win, and so he won't consider our interests and concerns."" Insisting he's not telling Quebecers how to vote federally, St-Pierre Plamondon nevertheless lumped Trudeau and Poilievre together as bad news for Quebec on everything from immigration to health transfer payments and secularism. The PQ leader went so far as to say Poilievre reflects the same kind of contempt for Quebec's independence movement that many western Canadians hold. ""Whether it is Trudeau's left-wing multiculturalism or the conservative right of the Canadian West, the contempt for Quebec is the same and striking,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said, referring to comments made by Poilievre in a recent interview with Jordan Peterson St-Pierre Plamondon said he called in the media because he found Premier François Legault's response to Trudeau's resignation Monday lukewarm and not a reflection of the difficulties Quebec has experienced in Trudeau's nine years as PM. On Monday, Legault stuck to the positive in his comments on Trudeau's departure. ""Although our opinions have often diverged, I want to salute today the public service of Justin Trudeau and his commitment to Canada,"" Legault said in a statement. ""We have significant challenges ahead, particularly with the arrival of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. I will continue to work with Mr. Trudeau, his successor and the current government to avoid these tariffs"" St-Pierre Plamondon had his own post-mortem of Trudeau's performance, saying he has been a ""terrible, terrible, terrible"" prime minister as far as Quebec goes. ""He was perhaps one of the worst prime ministers in the history of Canada when it comes to the way he treated Quebec,"" St-Pierre Plamondon said. He insisted his acerbic criticism was justified because the government in Ottawa is about to change and it's time to take stock. He denied showing a lack of respect. ""Remember, Justin Trudeau did not die,"" he said. ""He resigned, and not because he wanted to He had to be forced to leave after doing everything he could to hang on. That's why this morning I am not hesitating to examine his record by trying to be as factual as possible."" St-Pierre Plamondon ran down the list of things he felt Trudeau has bungled, including out-of-control immigration, zero interest in the demands of Quebec, doubling the national debt, plus all kinds of ideological drifting. ""Trudeau was not really qualified for that job,"" he said. ""But he was very useful for many interest groups who needed someone to push through their demands."" St-Pierre Plamondon said Poilievre would give Quebec other forms of frustration, such as having to put up with the Conservatives wanting to invest in oil development projects. Poilievre, he added, has never said where he stands on immigration levels and, like Trudeau, is opposed to Quebec's secularism law, Bill 21 Poilievre also has almost zero understanding of the Quebec independence movement except to say it exists because Trudeau weakened the economy, which he would fix, St-Pierre Plamondon said. As far as Poilievre is concerned, the independence movement represents a ""threat"" and he would have no intention of giving any legitimacy to Quebec's demands for more power should he take office, the PQ leader said. St-Pierre Plamondon said the only logical conclusion in his mind is that since the system won't change, it's time for Quebec to leave it and become a separate country. ""The problem is not Justin Trudeau,"" he said. ""It's the regime; it's Canada. The system is conceived to hamper or simply ignore Quebec's interests because we only have one-fifth of the seats in the Canadian Parliament. ""The PSPP crystal ball sees nothing good in what lies ahead in the event there is a Poilievre government,"" St-Pierre Plamondon added.

Tuesday's letters: Justin Trudeau following Mulroney's path,2025.0,"For all those that think the Trudeau calamity is something new: Brian Mulroney stepped down as PC leader on Feb. 24, 1993. Kim Campbell was chosen the leader of the PC party on June 13, 1993, became PM June 25, 1993 and lost the federal election to Jean Chretien on Oct. 25, 1993. Mulroney's legacy was that members of his government left to form the BQ and the Reform Party was created during his time in office. If the media believe that Trudeau tearing Canada apart is something new, compared to Mulroney, Justin Trudeau is an amateur. Thanks to Mulroney, the PC party was left with two seats in the House of Commons, lost official party status, and that was the end of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

As Liberal leadership contenders fight it out and Canada barrels toward an election that will likely result in a new governing party or coalition, the challenge will not be placating Mr. Trump – an inadvisable and impossible task – but rather protecting Canadian political and economic interests in an era bound to be marked by increasing American volatility. Mr. Poilievre may borrow from Mr. Trump’s populist playbook, but he, like any Canadian leader, must ultimately answer to a political culture that values stability over chaos, compromise over confrontation, and most importantly, its hard-won sovereignty over any foreign influence, whether invited or imposed.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Thompson, Debra",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 7, 2025",Conservatism; Political campaigns; Presidential elections; Political leadership; Populism; Prime ministers; Political parties,,2025-01-07,The Globe and Mail
"Singh, Poilievre poised for election:   Party leaders say next Liberal leader will bear burden of Trudeau's legacy of bad public policy",2025.0,"There is no new leader that could save the Liberal minority government from an election this spring, opposition parties said Monday, as each made the case that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation does nothing to clear the stink of his unpopularity from those who will now battle to replace him. Almost immediately after Trudeau announced his intention to step down as prime minister on Monday, opposition parties argued that any Liberal leader who takes his place will bear the burden of what they argue is a legacy of bad public policy. Leaders of the federal Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and New Democratic Party made clear that they want an election as soon as possible. Since Gov. Gen. Mary Simon agreed to Trudeau's request Monday to suspend Parliament until March 24, the opposition parties will have their next chance to topple the Liberal government early this spring. ""What has really changed?"" asked Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, speaking in a video that was posted online Monday morning. ""Every Liberal MP in power today, and every potential Liberal leadership contender fighting for the top job, helped Justin Trudeau break the country over the last nine years,"" he said. ""Their only objection is (Trudeau) is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power,"" Poilievre continued. ""They want to protect their pensions and paycheque by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election to trick you and then do it all over again."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh similarly painted all Liberals with the Trudeau brush. At a virtual press conference, Singh repeatedly ruled out working with a new Liberal leader, as he did with Trudeau in a parliamentary alliance that made progress on left-wing priorities like public dental care and pharmacare coverage for diabetes medication and birth control. Singh said his NDP will vote at the first chance to declare non-confidence in the Liberal government and try to trigger an election, which he framed as a contest between his New Democrats' ""movement of working-class people"" and a Conservative party keen to cut government programs. ""It does not matter who is chosen as the next Liberal leader. They have let you down. They do not deserve another chance,"" Singh said. ""So as soon as there is a confidence vote, New Democrats will be voting against the government, and then we will have an election."" Yves-François Blanchet, the Bloc leader, also dismissed the idea that his separatist Québec party would work with Trudeau's successor. Calling the Liberal government's policies ""catastrophic,"" Blanchet argued Trudeau's administration has centralized power in Ottawa, opposed Quebec state secularism, failed to adequately support the French language and irresponsibly favoured multiculturalism in a way that has allowed hate speech, among other things. Blanchet said anyone in the Liberal party is linked to this political program, and that the government can't remake itself in a matter of weeks under a new leader ahead of an election he expects to start shortly after Parliament returns near the end of March. ""It's the same organization, the same values, the same ideology,"" Blanchet said of the Liberal party. For more than a year, national opinion polls have shown Poilievre's Conservatives hold a commanding lead in voting intentions, with the Liberals sliding down into numbers that would cause them to lose a huge number of seats. But even before Trudeau announced his intention to resign on Monday, the Conservatives have tried to tie possible successors to Trudeau's policies. The Conservatives started calling Mark Carney - the former central banker in Canada and the United Kingdom whom a source told the Star is considering a leadership run - ""Carbon Tax Carney."" That's a reference to the current Liberal government's carbon tax-and-rebate policy, which the Conservatives promise to scrap and attack as a wrong-headed climate policy that hikes costs without meaningfully cutting greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study published by the Institute for Research on Public Policy found carbon pricing has had a ""minimal"" impact on inflation, while the Canadian Climate Institute has predicted consumer carbon pricing could account for between eight and 14 per cent of Canada's projected emissions reductions by 2030. Jason Lietaer, the president of the strategic communications firm Enterprise Canada who worked for former prime minister Stephen Harper, said most Conservatives would rather face Trudeau in the next election. But he predicted Poilievre's party will be able to link any potential Liberal successor - including those who aren't serving in his government, like Carney and former British Columbia premier Christy Clark, who is also said to be mulling a run - to Trudeau's legacy in a way that benefits the Conservatives' chances in the next election. ""People aren't just tired of Trudeau. They are tired of the state of Canada"" under his government, Lietaer said. Meanwhile, the NDP sees an opportunity in Trudeau's departure - especially if he is replaced by a leader who tries to swing the Liberal party toward the right, said a senior New Democrat insider. Some Liberals have told the Star the party became damagingly associated with leftist politics under Trudeau. And the NDP believes leadership candidates might stress more fiscal conservatism, after Chrystia Freeland resigned as finance minister last month and suggested she was at odds with Trudeau over their government's spending levels, which blew past their own targets to restrain last year's budget deficit by more than $20 billion. Freeland has also been calling MPs and is interested in a potential leadership run, sources told the Star last week. Any rightward shift could open up progressive votes for the NDP, said the insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Whatever the case, though, the source added that all parties are now acting like an election is in the offing, with a possible voting day in early or mid-May if the government falls when Parliament resumes. ""We're in a campaign now,"" they said.

Poilievre will need a new playbook as the Liberals pull their quarterback,2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre wants Canadians to believe that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation is just an attempt to “trick” them.

Mr. Poilievre’s attacks on “Carbon Tax Carney” seek to tie the climate-finance guru to the Trudeau government’s hated environmental levy, which Mr. Carney once strongly supported.

Except that Mr. Mulroney, a centrist Tory, worked to build broad appeal on both Main Street and Bay Street. Mr. Poilievre, a populist Conservative who feeds on support from polarizing figures such as Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk, has lashed out at “corporate lobbyists” and accused them of being “utterly useless in advancing any common-sense interests” of average Canadians. That leaves an opening for potential Liberal leadership candidates such as Ms. Freeland, Mr. Carney and Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne, all of whom have cultivated close ties to Canadian business leaders and would favour more centrist economic policies than the freespending Mr. Trudeau, who clashed with both Ms. Freeland and her predecessor Bill Morneau over the government’s fiscal direction. Though Ms. Freeland is unavoidably associated with the Trudeau-era deficits, her blistering resignation letter – in which she denounced the government’s “costly political gimmicks” – laid down markers for a future leadership run focusing on a “fight for capital and investment” that was music to the ears of Bay Street economists.

Pierre Poilievre responds to Justin Trudeau's resignation: 'What has really changed?',2025.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre issued the following statement following Justin Trudeau's resignation as Liberal leader. The prime minister has asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament so a new Liberal leader can be chosen. Watch the video or read the full text of Poilievre's statement: Nothing has changed. Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin. The only way to fix what... - Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) January 6, 2025 Canadians desperate to turn the page on this dark chapter in our history might be relieved today that Justin Trudeau is finally leaving. But what has really changed? Every Liberal MP in power today and every potential Liberal leadership contender fighting for the top job helped Justin Trudeau break the country over the last 9 years. All Liberal politicians actively worked to pass into law the job-killing, inflationary carbon tax-a tax that Carbon Tax Carney endorsed in his book. All supported a law quadrupling the tax over the next 5 years. All voted for or actively supported Trudeau's out-of-control spending, debt and immigration. All passed Trudeau's housing policies that doubled the cost of homes. All Liberal politicians helped pass catch-and-release bail and house arrest for the most rampant reoffenders, policies that increased violent crime 50 per cent, gun crime 116 per cent and hate crime by 250 per cent. So, given that Liberal MPs and leadership contenders unanimously supported everything Trudeau has done, why dump him now, right before an election? Have they had a change of heart? Is it because they feel guilty that they doubled housing costs, hiked taxes, unleashed crime, broke immigration, forced a quarter of the population into poverty? No. They continued supporting Trudeau when he did all those things. No. Their only objection is that he is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power. They want to protect their pensions and paycheques by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election to trick you, and then do it all over again. Now, while leaderless Liberals focus on saving their jobs and fighting each other for power-the country spirals out of control-an out-of-control housing emergency, an out-of-control migrant crisis, an out-of-control $62 billion deficit, not to mention tariff threats from the United States, oh, and another NDP-Liberal carbon tax hike kicks in this April 1st ... everything is out of control... and now, the government is out-of-control. The Liberals know how wrong this all is, that's exactly why they shut down Parliament and paralyze government, all to save their own skins. This cannot go on. We need a carbon tax election now, to choose between: The NDP-Liberal costly coalition that taxes your food, punishes your work, doubles your housing costs and unleashes crime and drugs in your community. OR Common Sense Conservatives who will axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget and stop the crime. Canadians can take back control of their lives and their country. Take back control of our border, take back control of immigration, take back control of spending, deficits and inflation. Take back control of our streets by locking up criminals, banning drugs, treating addiction and stopping gun smugglers. We'll cap spending, axe taxes, reward work, build homes, uphold family, stop crime, secure borders, rearm our forces, restore our freedom and put Canada First. All with one mission: to bring home Canada's promise that every hardworking Canadian gets a powerful paycheque and pension that buys affordable food and homes on safe streets; where all are united for the country we know and love: Canada first, Canada last, Canada always.

"Change will take time, Poilievre says",2025.0,"Even before Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre gets a chance at possibly forming Canada's next government, he's warning supporters that implementing his agenda will be a challenge. Poilievre, who enters an election year riding high in opinion polls at the same time that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's days appear to be increasingly numbered, outlined the challenges he believes a future Conservative government would face in an interview with popular right-wing podcast host and author Jordan Peterson. The 90-minute interview marks the second lengthy sit-down Poilievre has given to Peterson, with the first being during his run for the Conservative party leadership in 2022. The pair enjoy a friendly relationship with overlapping audiences, particularly when it comes to young men. Peterson has extolled Poilievre's brand of conservatism and communications style and Poilievre has touted Peterson's 2018 book 12 Rules for Life and ended their most recent conversation by commending Peterson's legal fight with the College of Psychologists of Ontario. More than an hour into their conversation, Peterson asked Poilievre about his plan should his party form the next government. After listing off familiar promises, which include slashing federal spending on consultants as well as funding that goes to ""corporate welfare,"" and cutting ""foreign aid,"" Poilievre told Peterson he anticipates doing so will be a challenge. ""It's going to be a big fight with all these things because there are so many vested interests that will be trying to hold us back,"" he said. ""So many small economic groups that have profited off the status quo, they will be fighting against me."" He continued: ""I'm going to have to put out a call to Canadians that they have to stay politically active, they can't assume that by simply voting in an election that everything is going to - all the problems are going to reverse instantaneously."" Poilievre also keeps a list of who he believes could be a thorn in a future Conservative government's side. ""I will need people to put pressure on the Senate to adopt my economic reforms. I will need people to put pressure on their mayors and local councillors and let us build homes. I will need businesses to actually do their part."" After a comment by Peterson about oil and gas companies toeing what he called the ""green line,"" Poilievre did not mince words, calling them ""idiots."" ""The big five oil and gas companies in Canada have idiot lobbyists."" Poilievre promised that should Conservatives win the next election, Canadians can expect a ""rapid introduction of the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history."" ""A massive crackdown,"" said Poilievre. Asked what that could look like, he says it means that those who are repeat offenders will be not released from jail. Trudeau's government has also sought to tackle concerns raised by premiers and police chiefs about the prevalence of violent repeat offenders by introducing a series of bail reforms to the Criminal Code last year, changes Poilievre has panned as not going far enough. Next to prosecuting Trudeau's record on the cost of living, Poilievre has poured his time into trying to convince Canadians that the anxieties they feel about crime and disorder in their cities, ranging from an increase in auto thefts and random violence on public transit, to open drug use and more visible homeless encampments, are the fault of Trudeau's government. staylor@postmedia.com","Chronicle - Herald; Halifax, N.S.","Halifax, N.S.","Taylor, Stephanie",CNW Group Ltd.,"Jan 6, 2025",Habitual offenders; Natural gas utilities; Prime ministers; Elections,Nom: Conservative Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-01-06,Chronicle - Herald
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set to address his future:   Trudeau has for months been adamant he would lead the Liberals into the next election against Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives,2025.0,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will hold a news conference today in which he’s expected to address his future as leader of the country and of the Liberal Party. The Globe reported on Sunday that according to three sources, Mr. Trudeau is expected to resign as Liberal Leader this week. The sources stressed that they don’t know definitely when Mr. Trudeau will announce his plans to leave but said they expect it will happen before a key national caucus meeting on Wednesday. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources because they were not authorized to discuss internal party matters. Mr. Trudeau has for months been adamant in public and private conversations that he would lead the Liberals into the next election against Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives. But he has faced a growing revolt, which began in earnest in mid-2024, grew into a caucus showdown in October and mushroomed into a full-scale crisis for his minority government by the end of the year. It reached a crescendo after Chrystia Freeland’s public rebuke in late December of the Prime Minister’s policies and politics as she quit his government rather than deliver the fall economic statement just days after he had privately informed her that she would be removed as his finance minister. The breakdown in the relationship between Mr. Trudeau and one of his closest allies led to a bigger revolt from Liberal MPs calling on the Prime Minister to resign. But the late-December turmoil also capped off a pileup of indicators that suggested a disastrous result for Mr. Trudeau’s party in the election, now just months away. In the span of six months, he suffered a spate of by-election losses, his popularity tumbled lower and a quarter of his cabinet announced they were walking away. A federal election is set for October but the government’s hand could be forced sooner as the New Democrats now also say they will not support the Liberals in the House of Commons, which could trigger an early election. The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois had already said the same.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Walsh, Marieke; Fife, Robert",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 6, 2025",Prime ministers,,2025-01-06,The Globe and Mail
Time for Poilievre to take questions,2025.0,"""Do you really want a safe place?"" Jordan B. Peterson wrote on his Facebook page two years ago. ""Is that what you want?"" It was a rhetorical question. The psychologist-turned-conservative media darling was railing against the fragile liberals who insist on cloistering themselves in their safe spaces. It is no life for a human being to be protected from threats, he continued. ""You should be confronting danger and the unknown and malevolence."" What irony, then, that Peterson's chummy podcast has become the preferred safe space for Pierre Poilievre. In a sprawling, nearly two-hour interview published last week, Peterson adoringly asks the Conservative party leader about his morning schedule, peppers him with softball questions about his growth as a politician and spends ample time casting just about everyone else - left, liberal and conservative alike - as some mix of immoral, dangerous or corrupt. The interview has earned rave reviews from Poilievre's fans, including billionaire Elon Musk. But beyond the hagiography of the probable-next-prime-minister, the interview rarely gets to anything particularly new or interesting. That's a shame. While Poilievre has now sat down with Peterson twice, he has been functionally boycotting the mainstream political press in this country. My repeated interview requests to his office have now been ignored for two years and counting, and I know my colleagues are in a similar spot. Conservatives have laughed at me when I make this point. Their party is riding high in the polls, and they are doing so while making villains of the Canadian Press, vowing to defund the CBC and ignoring interview requests from the Star. Why stop what's working? I could tell you that eschewing professional journalists for podcasters like Peterson, who extols a smorgasbord of kooky beliefs, is bad for democracy. But I confess that lecturing Poilievre on democratic norms right now would be pretty rich, given we currently have a prime minister clinging to power despite the clear will of voters, his own caucus and Parliament. So never mind our weakening norms. Poilievre should diversify out from his cadre of adoring right-wing influencers and talk to the establishment press specifically to show he is capable of confronting danger. He should, in other words, take Peterson's advice. But he won't, for the same reason that Peterson won't exit his ideological safe space. Because it can be hard to drop the security blanket, because they imbue you with an extraordinary self-assurance. When Peterson asked Poilievre, for example, how he would resist the ""global utopian delusion"" that has swamped other conservative politicians in recent years, Poilievre, quite smugly, replied: ""I know better."" He explained that conservatives fail when they abandon their core principles and ""go off and chase the ideas of (their) political opponents."" I don't think he's entirely wrong there. The NDP and Liberal party have shown the pitfalls of trying to be all things to all people: It leaves you directionless, with muddled policy plans. The Conservative party should be a conservative party. But Poilievre has conflated the need to be ideologically consistent with the need to be politically pure. That is, he is much more concerned with impressing Peterson's uber-online and hyperpartisan fandom than with preparing to actually govern the country. That's why he accuses the Liberals of wanting to force us to eat bugs and amplifies fear-mongering about transgender people. The more conspiratorial buzzwords he can hit, and the more extreme terms with which he can condemn his opponents, the more his cheering section gets riled up. Poilievre was gently chided last month by Jean-René Dufort, a.k.a. Infoman, for his habit of insulting his political rivals. Poilievre rejected that criticism, explaining that politicians should never be seen as friendly to each other, otherwise Canadians might come to see Parliament as ""a club of politicians who protect each other."" But Poilievre isn't actually talking about most Canadians, who generally want to see more camaraderie in politics, not less. He's talking about his supporters, who already see the entire political class as corrupt and collusive. Behind closed doors, Conservative MPs insist that, in government, they'll act normal again. They will, in other words, leave their safe space once the danger passes. To return to Peterson's sage advice: Politicians, like the rest of us humans, cannot thrive when coddled from danger. They need to be challenged and made to feel unsafe, or else they'll never fully realize their own limitations, shortcomings and strengths. So, enough talking to Jordan B. Peterson. It's time to take some tough questions for a change, Mr. Poilievre. Justin Ling is an independent investigative journalist based in Montreal and a contributing columnist for the Star.

"Peterson gets interesting insights out of Poilievre, even in spite of himself:   Interview unearthed some enlightening things about the man who is likely to become the next prime minister",2025.0,"It’s hard to know how to identify Jordan Peterson based on the attention he commands. An academic? A culture warrior? A self-help guru? In any case, he sat down for a long interview with Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre that was released a few days ago, and the conversation unearthed some enlightening things about the man who is likely to become the next prime minister, almost in spite of the instincts of the man interviewing him. First, despite a commanding and enduring lead in the polls, Mr. Poilievre’s schedule suggests he is not on cruise control. He described a hectic life “bifurcated” between Parliament Hill duties – meeting with his leadership team to plan the day’s approach to committees, Question Period and “the daily prosecution of the government” – and touring to rallies and events. Mr. Poilievre had just asked his assistant how many appearances he had made over the previous year and the answer was 600. Many of the locations he took pains to mention were distinctly blue-collar – mines, factories, farms. “You get a practical insight of how the country actually works. Like, who makes the widgets? How do those get made? How does our supply chain come together?” he said. “That practical insight, I think, is important if you want to lead a government, a national economy,” he added. A while later, Mr. Peterson asked why he thought the Conservatives had been so successful politically over the past couple of years. For a bit, the two of them got tangled up trying to out-dunk each other on the corrosive lefty stupidity galloping across the globe, but then Mr. Poilievre said something interesting. “The problem we’ve had in this country and all of the countries that have been afflicted by this horrendous, utopian wokeism is that it’s been focused on the grandiosity of the leadership, of the egotistical personalities on top, and not the things that are grand and great about the common people,” he said. The thing is, if you strip away Mr. Poilievre’s constant, stultifying instinct to kick his ideological opponents in the shins and his insistence on talking about normal people like zoo exhibits, that’s a pretty good summary of where politics is, not just in Canada but far beyond its borders right now. Ordinary people feel the system is rigged and are evicting the fancy types who have done nicely within it. Possibly the greatest demonstration of Mr. Poilievre’s political skill is how successfully he has positioned himself as the avatar of the first group and excised himself from the second, despite being a literal career politician. I suppose that since this conversation was on Mr. Peterson’s podcast, he’s entitled to think of himself as the star and indeed, for many in his audience, he is. But unfortunately, he was often so busy unspooling his own big ideas – unmistakably uttered in capitalized words given their importance and specificity to his vision of the world – that he stomped all over interesting insights he was on the edge of eliciting from his guest. At one point, Mr. Poilievre had just started to explore a pronounced conservative shift among young people, when Mr. Peterson smashed through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man in a three-piece suit, to seize on what this implied of the young men who have been his own most devoted audience. “Well, no wonder,” he said. “Because they’ve been demonized for what, 30 straight years for every aspect of their masculinity, from their play preferences to their proclivity to destroy the planet with their ambition.” There’s an online meme in which you reply “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” when someone goes on a heavy-handed rant, to indicate that they’ve gone wildly off topic and should just pick a cheeseburger. Mr. Peterson, sir, this is a Wendy’s. Otherwise, Mr. Poilievre talked at length about what he sees as the fundamentally broken social contract in Canada. He has a friend whose family came from Italy in 1973, he said, and with the father paving roads and the mother making sandwiches in a seniors’ home, they were able to pay off their house in central Ottawa in seven years. Mr. Poilievre contrasted that with their grandchildren, who despite having advanced degrees and all the advantages that come with that, would not be able to save up even for a down payment for that same house. Here, and a few other times in the interview, Mr. Peterson asked the most useful and obvious question of Mr. Poilievre at this moment, given how the next federal election is poised to shake out and how imminent it might be: So what’s your plan here? “What we have to do is stop growing the money supply and start growing the stuff money buys, right?” he said. “Produce more energy, grow more food, build more homes. We have to unleash the free-enterprise system to produce more stuff of value, and this is where we have to remove the artificial scarcity that the government is imposing.” He gave several other answers on his future plans that amounted to the same idea: Canada and its economy are being deliberately strangled by a control-freaky “radical” government, and simply getting out of the way will allow prosperity and fairness to bloom like so many springtime flowers. Mr. Poilievre has spent the past few years pointing at major social and economic stress points that the Liberals and various other self-satisfied elites seemed blind to. He noticed the anger and resentment that these fractures were causing, and he gave that feeling a voice and told it where to point the blame. But so far, his proffered solutions have been no more specific or substantial than the chapter titles of a self-help book in Mr. Peterson’s oeuvre: Unleash. Build. Be Free. That might be great for a podcast audience, but it’s not much in a real world full of big and wicked problems. And the louder you tell people that everything wrong with their lives is that guy’s fault, the more they will be waiting for your solutions when that guy is gone and all the problems belong to you.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Proudfoot, Shannon",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 6, 2025",Young adults; Self help; Audiences; Interviews,,2025-01-06,The Globe and Mail
"Jordan Peterson gets interesting insights out of Pierre Poilievre, in spite of himself:   In an interview with Peterson, Poilievre gave several answers on his future plans that amounted to the same idea: Canada and its economy are being deliberately strangled by a control-freaky ‘radical’ government",2025.0,"It’s hard to know how to identify Jordan Peterson based on the attention he commands. An academic? A culture warrior? A self-help guru? In any case, he sat down for a long interview with Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre that was released a few days ago, and the conversation unearthed some enlightening things about the man who is likely to become the next prime minister, almost in spite of the instincts of the man interviewing him. First, despite a commanding and enduring lead in the polls, Mr. Poilievre’s schedule suggests he is not on cruise control. He described a hectic life “bifurcated” between Parliament Hill duties – meeting with his leadership team to plan the day’s approach to committees, Question Period and “the daily prosecution of the government” – and touring to rallies and events. Mr. Poilievre had just asked his assistant how many appearances he had made over the previous year and the answer was 600. Many of the locations he took pains to mention were distinctly blue-collar – mines, factories, farms. “You get a practical insight of how the country actually works. Like, who makes the widgets? How do those get made? How does our supply chain come together?” he said. “That practical insight, I think, is important if you want to lead a government, a national economy,” he added. A while later, Mr. Peterson asked why he thought the Conservatives had been so successful politically over the past couple of years. For a bit, the two of them got tangled up trying to out-dunk each other on the corrosive lefty stupidity galloping across the globe, but then Mr. Poilievre said something interesting. “The problem we’ve had in this country and all of the countries that have been afflicted by this horrendous, utopian wokeism is that it’s been focused on the grandiosity of the leadership, of the egotistical personalities on top, and not the things that are grand and great about the common people,” he said. The thing is, if you strip away Mr. Poilievre’s constant, stultifying instinct to kick his ideological opponents in the shins and his insistence on talking about normal people like zoo exhibits, that’s a pretty good summary of where politics is, not just in Canada but far beyond its borders right now. Ordinary people feel the system is rigged and are evicting the fancy types who have done nicely within it. Possibly the greatest demonstration of Mr. Poilievre’s political skill is how successfully he has positioned himself as the avatar of the first group and excised himself from the second, despite being a literal career politician. I suppose that since this conversation was on Mr. Peterson’s podcast, he’s entitled to think of himself as the star and indeed, for many in his audience, he is.

"Admiring the beauty of B.C.:   Couple found memories to last a lifetime in Vancouver, Victoria and Campbell River",2025.0,"We asked Star readers to tell us about trips they have taken and share their tips and advice: Where Vancouver, Victoria, Campbell River, British Columbia When September 2024 Trip rating 5/5 We have been thinking and talking about this trip for a couple of years. We decided the best time would be spring (May) or autumn (September). We decided September worked best for us. From Toronto we got a direct flight to Vancouver. Stay downtown. We stayed in downtown Vancouver at the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre. It is a great location downtown and we were able to walk around, and had a wonderful selection of restaurants and shops to explore. The next morning we took a short taxi ride to Canada Place and got the Hullo ferry to Nanaimo. Pay the extra to sit on the second level for a much better view. It was smooth sailing and a fast 70-minute ride to get over to Vancouver Island. From Nanaimo, we drove to Victoria and checked into the Huntingdon Hotel and Suites, located a block away from the Parliament Buildings and right in the inner harbour. It's a great location with underground parking and you can walk and explore around the downtown and inner harbour. Three things I would highly suggest you see or do in Victoria: The Butchart Gardens High tea at the Fairmont Empress Take a taxi around the harbour, stay and see Fisherman's Wharf. We spent most of one day at the Butchart Gardens. It is amazing and each garden has its own beauty. After high tea, we decided to drive south to Sidney. After a lovely walk around, we enjoyed a live performance of ""Still Crazy"" at the Charlie White Theatre. After spending five amazing days in Victoria, we drove up to Campbell River. We took our time and stopped in Mill Bay. We had lunch in Cowichan Bay. We saw the lovely painted murals on buildings in Chemainus. We made a stop in Ladysmith for some delicious scones and sweets at the Old Town Bakery to enjoy when we get to Campbell River. In Campbell River, there are a lot of things to see and do. We enjoyed the Campbell River Museum, Dolphins Resort, Anglers Dining and Painter's Lodge, and the Solemn Hatchery Quinsam River Hatchery for salmon. We also had a great tour of Shelter Point Distillery for whisky. Be sure to go cycling. In all the cities we were in, they had great bike and hiking trails to explore (mostly along the waterfront). One day we had an early start and drove to Port Alberni to board the MV Frances Barkley boat, operated by Lady Rose Marine Services. From Port Alberni, we cruised to Bamfield. We had a lovely lunch at Flora's Restaurant there. We enjoyed this two-week trip with so much to see and do. Luckily we had excellent weather with only a little rain one day. We're looking forward to visiting the area in the future. I would strongly suggest you take this trip as it was worth every minute, and the beauty of the water and mountains will leave you memories for a lifetime.

"Five takeaways from Peterson-Poilievre talk:   Tory leader made case for more oil production, less 'woke-ism' and a tighter relationship with U.S.",2025.0,"With Justin Trudeau dangling from the proverbial political cliff, his primary rival spent two hours in conversation with right-wing provocateur Jordan Peterson in a podcast released this week, in which Pierre Poilievre made his case for a Canada with more oil production, less ""woke-ism"" and a tighter relationship with Donald Trump's America. ""If you look at the history of President Trump, he negotiates very aggressively and he likes to win,"" Poilievre said. ""But in the end, he doesn't appear to have a problem if his counterparty also wins,"" he added, arguing that he would show up to deliberations with strength. ""I think that we can get a great deal that will make both countries safer, richer and stronger."" The interview, conducted on Dec. 21, was posted on Peterson's own podcast and The Daily Wire, a conservative U.S. website (where viewers can pay to watch an extra half-hour of bonus content). Peterson, a former University of Toronto professor who used a firestorm over transgender pronouns to fuel a lucrative career in online commentary, is arguably one of Canada's biggest digital exports. Poilievre, meanwhile, aims to become Canada's next prime minister. As with any conversation about Canadian politics lately, Trudeau loomed large. Calling him the greatest ""poster boy for modern progressivism,"" Peterson said, ""I don't think any administration in the West has failed as cataclysmically as his administration."" Here are five major takeaways from the interview. Why young people are swinging conservative A recent political trend in Canada and other Western democracies is a rightward shift among young voters. An Abacus poll from last year found that just over a third of those surveyed between the ages of 18 and 29 would support the Conservatives, more than any other party. Poilievre pointed to a return to basic values like family and home ownership, plus the simmering frustration with the cost of everything. ""When I meet young people today, they are exhausted. They have bags under their eyes, and all they do is work,"" he told Peterson. He said basic ambitions like buying a house or having kids is much more expensive than it was for their parents. ""Young people say, 'Look, OK, I went through, I got an education, I work non-stop, and I have made the calculation that there is no mathematical path for me to own a house.' It's just not possible in Toronto here, for example."" On energy and the environment The secret sauce to Canada's economy is our energy, Poilievre said. ""Energy of all kinds, hydro, nuclear, natural gas, you name it,"" he said. ""So let's unleash the production of these resources and bring all that money home you can."" If he becomes PM, he said he will do all he can to ease restrictions on projects, including refineries and liquefied natural gas. As a counterpoint to ""environmental loons who hate our energy sector,"" he points to advocates who say exporting natural gas would help wean countries like India off coal-fired power, thereby reducing global emissions. He said he's already talked to people like Alberta Premier Danielle Smith to warn her to be ready to reform laws to ""get some resource projects going immediately."" The importance of Canadian identity and ditching the hyphens In the wake of Liberal changes to how many people would be able to immigrate to Canada, Poilievre spoke in favour of continued reform to the immigration system, but also a need for newcomers to adapt to Canadian society. That means ""reminding people that when they get here, they are Canadian first,"" Poilievre said. ""Leave the hyphens. We don't need to be a hyphenated society."" He cited the example of Catholics and Protestants who were ""ripping each other's eyeballs out in Europe for centuries"" but then came to Canada and got along. ""In the last nine years that's come apart. Foreign conflicts are now spilling onto our streets. I want to put an end to that,"" he said. ""I want to say, 'Look, we're not interested in the world's ethnocultural conflicts.' "" By celebrating our shared culture and history, he said, ""we can, by the way, put aside race, this obsession with race that woke-ism has reinserted."" Dealing with Trump Poilievre said he would fund a more robust military and continental defence in order to show the Americans that Canada is doing its part. While some of Trump's opening salvos - the jokes about Canada becoming the 51st state, the threat of tariffs on Canadian goods - had been ""humiliating"" to watch, Poilievre called Trump a ""highly successful businessman"" who can ""spot weakness a mile away."" ""What I would say to the Americans is, let's take out a map of our shared continent, and here's the 49th parallel. Where do you believe we need to do more to protect our shared security across that map?"" On personally earmarking cuts to spending One of Poilievre's key points is the need to cut back on government spending to curb excess and inflationary pressures. ""I'm going through these programs myself and looking at them one by one, because I want to go in with as much preparation as possible, so that when, God willing, I'm elected, the officials sit down and I can say, 'Well, I already know that program is a waste of money, and that one's a waste of money, and that one's a corrupt scandal,' "" he said. At this point, Peterson said he has a DOGE dossier at hand, a reference to Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency - co-headed by tech billionaire Elon Musk - to cut U.S. spending. ""I wouldn't say it quite like that,"" Poilievre said, ""but I have spent a lot of time looking at where I can find the savings.""

The Tories give in to their worst impulses:   Pierre Poilievre’s latest video is downright juvenile – and runs counter to how the party wants to be seen,2025.0,"Credit to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has, in a small way, taken action against youth unemployment even before he becomes prime minister. With the creation of his latest movie, which his party named “WACKOS: the weird, wild, woke & wonderful world of the people running our country,” Mr. Poilievre must have employed at least a half-dozen members of middle-school Conservative clubs from around the country, and given them the important task of splicing video clips together to make themselves and their buddies laugh. These kids took all of your favourite Justin Trudeaurelated memes and jokes from the past near-decade – about the Prime Minister appearing in blackface, about Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault’s past antics as a member of Greenpeace, about former finance minister Chrystia Freeland musing about a “vibecession” – and created a 12-minute movie, set to weird opera music, to highlight the zaniest aspects of the cast of characters who have run the government since 2015. Using a British narrator – the erudite-sounding voice you’d normally hear in a wildlife documentary describing a lion eating an antelope – the movie describes Mr. Trudeau’s “wackonomics” (with a clip of Mr. Trudeau saying the budget will “balance itself”), his ministers’ “wacko tirades” (with a clip of Health Minister Mark Holland ranting about climate change) and ends with a list of inside-joke-type credits that lists, for example, “Black Shoe Polish, Ltd.” as responsible for costume design. (I’m not sure how the Conservatives can both claim to be aghast that Mr. Trudeau wore blackface and joke about black shoe polish, but I’ll leave it to members to reconcile.) Lest I be accused of being a humourless scold, I will point out here that I like humour – particularly the funny kind – but I’ll admit that I grew bored of the video by about the three-minute mark. While I know it isn’t nice to criticize children’s work, and I know these 12-year-olds probably worked hard to put this video together, this “movie” is just a rehashing of the governments’ most trivial, jejune failings, with jokes that were stale even years ago (have you heard the one about the Prime Minister wearing blackface?!). There are plenty of serious things about which one should criticize this government, like destroying our immigration system and turning a blind eye to foreign interference. That Mr. Trudeau also likes to play dressup should be relatively low on the list of Canadians’ concerns, and jokes about his costumes stopped being funny three years ago. That said, I understand what the Conservatives were trying to do here: they wanted to create a viral video that would be clipped, shared and laughed at, and also one that would implicitly convey the message that the Trudeau government is shallow, weird and corrosively eccentric. This video does accomplish that. But what it also does, implicitly, is show the Conservatives giving in to their worst impulses: those cocky, 12year-old prepubescent-boy urges to make fart noises with their armpits to make each other laugh. It’s like when former Conservative leader Erin O’Toole posted a video where he pointed to a porta-potty and said that he was going to make it Mr. Trudeau’s next office. It’s a fun thing to do when you’re winning, after all, and Conservatives, obviously, are winning. There are numerous reasons why the party under Mr. Poilievre is up 20 points in the polls, but an important one is that he took steps early on to cut through the Conservative bubble and talk to Canadians like adults. He’s released thoughtful, detailed videos on policy: 15-minute videos, which are a lifetime in the online world, on Canada’s housing crisis and economic stagnation. He’s tapped into genuine frustrations over the cost of living, about fair wages and generational inequality. And it’s worked: women, young people, and even unionized workers have migrated their support to the Conservatives. Whereas the past several years in particular of Trudeau governance seems to have been riddled with scandal and chaos, Mr. Poilievre has managed to successfully project an air of calm and competence. His WACKO video undermines that: unnecessarily, too, since it’s pretty clear by Mr. Trudeau’s -43 net favourability that Canadians don’t need reminding that they don’t care for this current government. They want stability, seriousness, and new leadership that can take on the very real threats posed by potential tariffs set to be implemented by incoming U.S. president Donald Trump, and an adult who can recentre the country amid the ever-increasing turmoil at home and abroad. What we don’t need are frat boys with a YouTube account and a free video-editor subscription. But if Mr. Poilievre is committed to keeping his young movie-makers employed, he should at least ask them to find some new material.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Urback, Robyn",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 4, 2025",Conservatism; Leadership; Jokes; Scandals; Prime ministers,,2025-01-04,The Globe and Mail
"Nobody is looking out for Canada’s interests:   Not the Liberal government, not the Conservative Party, not MPs in the House – no one is speaking credibly for the country",2025.0,"A former clerk of the Privy Council and a former vice-chair of BMO Financial Group There is much reporting about the backstabbing and dysfunction within Justin Trudeau’s government and endless “will he, won’t he” speculation about whether the Prime Minister will resign. But one question is conspicuously absent from the conversation: Who is looking out for Canada’s interests? It is not the current government, which is in such turmoil that it is barely breathing, let alone governing. Its fall budget, masquerading as an economic statement, was basically dead on bizarre arrival, tabled ministerless and loveless in the House. Its lifespan is measured in weeks from when Parliament resumes, given the public statements of the Conservatives, NDP and Bloc Québécois to vote no-confidence. The Liberals’ prospects in the election that will ensue, according to the polls, are somewhere between bleak and Armageddon. But what about the country itself? The global coverage of our imploding government is hardly reassuring for allies or investors. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is drawn to weakness like a lion on the Serengeti. In an election with the Liberals led by Mr. Trudeau, it is quite possible the Bloc could become the Official Opposition and, with the Parti Québécois leading in the polls provincially, Quebec could face another sovereignty referendum. The government has squandered our fiscal advantage, hollowed out our military, shattered our immigration system and shown little interest in our anemic productivity while economic, geopolitical and security threats to Canada rise to Defcon levels. If the Liberal Party cared about more than just itself, it would think about the risks we are facing on national unity and the sovereignty of the country not to mention Mr. Trump’s threats. It urgently needs a new leader without the baggage of the dismal fiscal and economic track record of recent years, the post-national rhetoric that undermines our sense of nationhood and the symbol of the divisive carbon tax. Canada needs someone who can negotiate with the Trump administration in a pragmatic way, protecting our national interests while dealing effectively and quickly with irritants. But the frontrunning Conservative Party doesn’t appear to be looking out for Canada’s interests, either. If Conservatives cared about more than their party’s strong electoral prospects, they would assist – even better, lead – in building a strong, unified Team Canada approach to dealing with Mr. Trump. The simple math of the parliamentary calendar and length of federal electoral campaigns is, there can be no election held until early April or, in the event of prorogation, later in May. That leaves a lame-duck Trudeau government at the mercy of Mr. Trump for months in the absence of a concerted federal-provincialprivate sector-American partners coalition to beat back the threat of 25-per-cent tariffs. Indeed, given Mr. Trump’s concerns about Chinese hegemony, such an alliance could broaden the conversation to strengthening the North American economy, rather than weakening it with bilateral tariffs. Meanwhile, the non-functioning House of Commons – the core institution of our democracy – bears a striking resemblance to Canada Post, which Canadians barely noticed was on strike. MPs should rise to the moment and pass legislation to tighten border security, crack down on drug smuggling and improve antimoney laundering rules – along with funding to support them – if we are to demonstrate to the Americans that we are credible. The Trump rollercoaster has not waited for the mere formality of his inauguration. Besides threatening punitive tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mocking Canada as the 51st state, the president-elect has promised immediate action on Ukraine while indicating he wants to take back the Panama Canal, buy Greenland and rain terror upon the BRICS countries if they de-dollarize. Canada, as a supporter of Ukraine, has a direct interest in any settling of the conflict, and we need a clear position going in. Yet, the Trudeau government’s repeated failure to meet our NATO defence spending commitments will likely become an issue for Mr. Trump over the course of these discussions and could sideline us. Adding more fuel to the national dysfunction is the fact that the ramp-up to the 2026 renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will begin soon, likely with a new set of outrageous Trump demands. The question on American and Mexican minds: Who speaks credibly for Canada? In June, Canada will host the 2025 G7 meeting. Mr. Trump will be at the peak of his powers and facing a weakened French President, a wounded Japanese Prime Minister, a stumbling British Prime Minister, a new German Chancellor and, if polls are accurate, a new Canadian Prime Minister. But who is setting the agenda for this pivotal Western conclave? Only a functioning government can help us prepare for the many challenges 2025 will bring.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Lynch, Kevin",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 3, 2025",Political campaigns; Prime ministers; Sovereignty; Tariffs,,2025-01-03,The Globe and Mail
Poilievre says don't expect problems to be fixed 'instantaneously' after election,2025.0,"OTTAWA - Even before Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre gets a chance at possibly forming Canada's next government, he's warning supporters that implementing his agenda will be a challenge. Poilievre, who enters an election year riding high in public opinion polls at the same time that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's days appear to be increasingly numbered, outlined the challenges he believes a future Conservative government would face in an interview with popular right-wing podcast host and author Jordan Peterson. The 90-minute interview marks the second lengthy sit-down Poilievre has given to Peterson, with the first recorded during his run for the Conservative party leadership back in 2022. The pair enjoy a friendly relationship with overlapping audiences, particularly when it comes to young men. Peterson has extolled Poilievre's brand of conservativism and communications style and Poilievre has touted Peterson's 2018 book 12 Rules for Life and ended their most recent conversation by commending Peterson's legal fight with the College of Psychologists of Ontario More than an hour into their conversation, Peterson asked Poilievre about his plan should his party form the next government. After listing off familiar promises, which include slashing federal spending on consultants as well as funding that goes to ""corporate welfare,"" and cutting ""foreign aid,"" Poilievre told Peterson he anticipates doing so will be a challenge. ""It's going to be a big fight with all of these things because there are so many vested interests that will be trying to hold us back,"" he says. ""So many small economic groups that have profited off the status quo, they will be fighting against me."" He continues: ""I'm going to have to put out a call to Canadians that they have to stay politically active, they can't assume that by simply voting in an election that everything is going to - all the problems are going to reverse instantaneously."" Poilievre also keeps a list of who he believes could be a thorn in a future Conservative government's side. ""I will need people to put pressure on the Senate to adopt my economic reforms. I will need people to put pressure on their mayors and local councillors and let us build homes. I will need businesses to actually do their part."" Western premiers call for a 'better deal' as equalization payments hit record $26.2B Liberal MPs say time's up for Trudeau to face Canadians on his future After a comment by Peterson about oil and gas companies toeing what he called the ""green line,"" Poilievre did not mince words, calling them ""idiots."" ""The big five oil and gas companies in Canada have idiot lobbyists."" Looking ahead to a future mandate, Poilievre promised that should Conservatives win the next election, Canadians can expect a ""rapid introduction of the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history."" ""A massive crackdown,"" said Poilievre. Asked what that could look like, he said it means that those who are repeat offenders will be not released from jail. Trudeau's government has also sought to tackle concerns raised by premiers and police chiefs about the prevalence of violent repeat offenders by introducing a series of bail reforms to the Criminal Code last year, changes Poilievre has panned as not going far enough. Next to prosecuting Trudeau's record on the cost of living, Poilievre has poured his time into trying to convince Canadians that the anxieties they feel about crime and disorder in their cities, ranging from an increase in auto thefts and random violence on public transit, to open drug use and more visible homeless encampments, are the fault of Trudeau's government. Successive public opinion polling shows Poilievre's strategy appears to be working, with him crediting the message discipline expected from his MPs. ""We've been acting in unison and I think that's why our message is pumping out so clearly to people,"" said Poilievre. ""It's not a cacophony of sound, it's a clear drum beat and that's why people are hearing and appreciating our message."" Critics, including Liberals, often say Poilievre's hyper-focus on slogans and messaging is a sign he lacks substance when it comes actual policy. In terms of what a future Conservative would do, Poilievre said his vow to ""axe"" the consumer carbon price remains a priority. ""It's been kind of an epic commitment that I've made - it's iconic,"" said Poilievre. ""I have to follow through on it immediately and that will signal to the country that I'm serious."" Eliminating the GST on new homes is also a priority, he said, as is getting cities to speed up housing construction by threatening to withhold federal infrastructure money if they fail to meet their targets. Conservative MPs such as Andrew Scheer, who serves as the party's house leader in Parliament, Melissa Lantsman, one of its deputy leaders, and Ontario MP Jamil Jivani were all names Poilievre rattled off when asked by Peterson about how he is building a strong team. He also told Peterson he has no intention of following in the footsteps of conservative parties around the world that, according to the pair, have a habit of trying to embrace left-wing policies - or, as Poilievre puts it, ""socialist"" policies - once they arrive in office. ""I'm not going to do that,"" Poilievre said. ""This is the mistake that conservative parties around the world have made countless times. They think, 'Well, anybody who's got a conservative mindset is already voting for me so I can go off and chase the ideas of my political opponents and then everyone will love me because I'll have the conservatives due to the fact I have the name 'Conservative' and these other people because I've embraced their contrary direction.'"" While Poilievre said he believes it's tempting to do in the short term, it winds up being a ""disaster"" when it comes to policies.

Tony Abbott: Pierre Poilievre must avoid the traps my government fell into,2025.0,"The current turmoil inside the Trudeau government makes a future Conservative win even more likely. Naturally enough, shrewd politician that he is, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will be taking nothing for granted and will be trying to win every possible vote. Still, after almost a decade of Liberal rule, culminating in a housing crisis, a cost-of-living crunch and a crime wave, a smart opposition would be thinking almost as much about how to govern well as about how to win the coming election. Up against a shop-soiled government, winning an election is the relatively easy part of an opposition party's job; the hard part is getting ready to run a good government, especially with the bureaucracy, the judiciary and the upper house all likely to be obstructive. Across the Anglosphere, recent conservative governments have tended to be in office but not really in power - either because they lacked an agenda of their own, or because what agenda they had was thwarted by a leftist establishment. Winning an election on a promise to be different, and subsequently having to make excuses when not enough changes, is the trap to be avoided by every centre-right political movement on the verge of victory. Donald Trump was first elected in 2016 on a promise to ""drain the swamp,"" but eventually, ""the swamp"" got him. As someone who'd never been in government and was unfamiliar with Washington, he had instincts rather than well-developed policies or even well-thought-through ideas for how to develop policy. So he churned through a series of cabinet outsiders, businessmen like Rex Tillerson and generals like Jim Mattis, who were either clueless about making a difference or turned out to have little like-mindedness with their boss. Trump's cuts to red tape and tax were enough to create an economic revival but his failure to tame the administrative state - which took over the pandemic response and then united behind a left-establishment challenger - doomed his first bid for a second term. The British Conservative government first elected in 2010 was initially handicapped by being in a coalition with the centre-left Liberal Democrats, then internally divided over Brexit, then led from the insipid centre under Theresa May and finally sabotaged by a ""remoaner"" establishment that the previous Labour government had empowered via the Equality Act, devolution and changes to the judiciary that no Conservative leader had the gumption to repeal. Boris Johnson had the potential to be a great prime minister but squandered working people's support on the altar of climate change-driven policy gimmicks like mandatory electric cars and heat pumps replacing gas boilers. Eventually, furious conservative voters with an understandable desire to punish the party that had let them down ended up punishing themselves by electing an incompetent and clueless Labour government. The Australian centre-right Liberal-National Coalition government that I led into office in 2013 started strongly enough by stopping a wave of illegal immigration by small boat and by repealing a carbon tax and a mining tax. But Senate obstruction sabotaged its first, economically reforming budget and internal policy differences then led to a revolving door prime ministership. If the clock could be turned back, I would have insisted that all my frontbenchers provide a detailed blueprint of what needed to change in order to make a difference in their portfolio area, and explain how their proposed changes reflected our ""smaller government, bigger citizen"" political instincts. I would have insisted that at least a version of their thinking be made public well before an election. That way, the bureaucracy - or at least that section of it still motivated by traditional Westminster ideals of impartial public service - would have had more guidance in policy formation. And incoming elected and accountable ministers would have been less susceptible to being ""snowed"" by unelected and unaccountable officials. An example of this was the introduction, by ministers who had been captured by bureaucrats, of the social engineering, gender fluidity-encouraging Safe Schools program, which was masquerading as an anti-bullying initiative, even though it had been devised under my predecessors. This is where incoming ministers need to have thought through all the key issues they are likely to deal with and be sufficiently robust to interrogate and stand up to officials urging caution or assuring them that the ""experts"" know best. Judging by the blizzard of announcements and appointments since his election, Trump is much better prepared this time than last. He seems to have used his time-out to ponder how he might do better, and since his election he has been acting quickly. It's not clear how much collaboration there was between Trump's team and efforts like the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, but at least a group of clever policy analysts at various think-tanks have been pondering do-able centre-right options for the incoming administration. If I had my time again, I would have worked in advance with like-minded institutes to prepare more detailed plans for key incoming ministers, rather than have them largely directed by the bureaucracy based on sometimes thin pre-election policy announcements. Even a big majority in the Canadian House of Commons does not guarantee that an incoming Poilievre government will be able to implement a strong conservative program. For one thing, incoming ministers - most of whom will have little practical government experience - will face difficulties with policy implementation. For another, Canada's appointed-till-retirement Senate is stacked with political progressives who are bound to be, at best, skeptical towards the new government. And Canada lacks even the hard-to-do and rarely used mechanisms for breaking a deadlock between the two houses of Parliament and for changing the Constitution to overcome judicial activism that Australia has. This is where it's especially important for an incoming Canadian government to have the strong and explicit mandate for change that only detailed policy proposals can generate. Over the past two years, Pierre Poilievre has brilliantly mobilized and crystallized opposition to the Trudeau government with his political mantra: axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime. This clearly identifies some of the key problems an incoming government will tackle but is less clear about how that might be done. It's never easy in opposition to get the balance right between saying too much and too little. But the more specific an opposition party that's about to form a government can be, the more likely it will be to succeed, because when voters back a clear and specific plan, that signals to all the unelected Senators, bureaucrats and judges that the public wants the proposed changes. The winds of change are sweeping across the Anglosphere. Pierre Poilievre can ensure that this will mean more than voting out the failed incumbent; it will mean delivering a new agenda for a better Canada.

Conservatives give into their worst impulses with their ‘Wacko’ movie on Trudeau:   A juvenile video from Pierre Poilievre runs counter to the Tories’ efforts to paint themselves as the voice of Canadian competence,2025.0,"Credit to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has, in a small way, taken action against youth unemployment even before he becomes prime minister. With the creation of his latest movie, which his party named “WACKOS: the weird, wild, woke & wonderful world of the people running our country,” Mr. Poilievre must have employed at least a half-dozen members of middle-school Conservative clubs from around the country, and given them the important task of splicing video clips together to make themselves and their buddies laugh. These kids took all of your favourite Justin-Trudeau-related memes and jokes from the past near-decade – about the Prime Minister appearing in blackface, about Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault’s past antics as a member of Greenpeace, about former finance minister Chrystia Freeland musing about a “vibecession” – and created a 12-minute movie, set to weird opera music, to highlight the zaniest aspects of the cast of characters who have run the government since 2015. Using a British narrator – the erudite-sounding voice you’d normally hear in a wildlife documentary describing a lion eating an antelope – the movie describes Mr. Trudeau’s “wackonomics” (with a clip of Mr. Trudeau saying the budget will “balance itself”), his ministers’ “wacko tirades” (with a clip of Health Minister Mark Holland ranting about climate change) and ends with a list of inside-joke-type credits that lists, for example, “Black Shoe Polish, Ltd.” as responsible for costume design. (I’m not sure how the Conservatives can both claim to be aghast that Mr. Trudeau wore blackface and joke about black shoe polish, but I’ll leave it to members to reconcile.) Lest I be accused of being a humourless scold, I will point out here that I like humour – particularly the funny kind – but I’ll admit that I grew bored of the video by about the three-minute mark. While I know it isn’t nice to criticize children’s work, and I know these 12-year-olds probably worked hard to put this video together, this “movie” is just a rehashing of the governments’ most trivial, jejune failings, with jokes that were stale even years ago (have you heard the one about the Prime Minister wearing blackface?!). There are plenty of serious things about which one should criticize this government, like destroying our immigration system and turning a blind eye to foreign interference. That Mr. Trudeau also likes to play dress-up should be relatively low on the list of Canadians’ concerns, and jokes about his costumes stopped being funny three years ago. That said, I understand what the Conservatives were trying to do here: they wanted to create a viral video that would be clipped, shared and laughed at, and also one that would implicitly convey the message that the Trudeau government is shallow, weird and corrosively eccentric. This video does accomplish that. But what it also does, implicitly, is show the Conservatives giving into their worst impulses: those cocky, 12-year-old prepubescent-boy urges to make fart noises with their armpits to make each other laugh. It’s like when former Conservative leader Erin O’Toole posted a video where he pointed to a porta-potty and said that he was going to make it Mr. Trudeau’s next office. It’s a fun thing to do when you’re winning, after all, and Conservatives, obviously, are winning. There are numerous reasons why the party under Mr. Poilievre is up 20 points in the polls, but an important one is that he took steps early on to cut through the Conservative bubble and talk to Canadians like adults. He’s released thoughtful, detailed videos on policy: 15-minute videos, which are a lifetime in the online world, on Canada’s housing crisis and economic stagnation. He’s tapped into genuine frustrations over the cost of living, about fair wages and generational inequality. And it’s worked: women, young people, and even unionized workers have migrated their support to the Conservatives. Whereas the past several years in particular of Trudeau governance seems to have been riddled with scandal and chaos, Mr. Poilievre has managed to successfully project an air of calm and competence. His WACKO video undermines that: unnecessarily, too, since it’s pretty clear from Mr. Trudeau’s -40 net approval that Canadians don’t need reminding that they don’t care for this current government. They want stability, seriousness, and new leadership that can take on the very real threats posed by potential tariffs set to be implemented by incoming U.S. president Donald Trump, and an adult who can recentre the country amid the ever-increasing turmoil at home and abroad. What we don’t need are frat boys with a YouTube account and a free video-editor subscription. But if Mr. Poilievre is committed to keeping his young movie-makers employed, he should at least ask them to find some new material.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Urback, Robyn",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 2, 2025",Conservatism; Leadership; Jokes; Scandals; Prime ministers,,2025-01-02,The Globe and Mail
"Who is looking out for Canada’s interests?:   No one – not the Liberal government, the Conservative Party, or MPs in the House – appears to be able to speak credibly for the country as we face serious threats",2025.0,"Kevin Lynch was a clerk of the Privy Council and vice-chair of BMO Financial Group. There is much reporting about the backstabbing and dysfunction within Justin Trudeau’s government and endless “will he, won’t he” speculation about whether the Prime Minister will resign. But one question is conspicuously absent from the conversation: Who is looking out for Canada’s interests? It is not the current government, which is in such turmoil that it is barely breathing, let alone governing. Its fall budget, masquerading as an economic statement, was basically dead on bizarre arrival, tabled minister-less and loveless in the House. Its lifespan is measured in weeks from when Parliament resumes, given the public statements of the Conservatives, NDP and Bloc Québécois to vote no-confidence. The Liberals’ prospects in the election that will ensue, according to the polls, are somewhere between bleak and Armageddon. But what about the country itself? The global coverage of our imploding government is hardly reassuring for allies or investors. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is drawn to weakness like a lion on the Serengeti. In an election with the Liberals led by Mr. Trudeau, it is quite possible that the Bloc could become the Official Opposition and, with the Parti Québécois leading in the polls provincially, Quebec could face another sovereignty referendum. The government has squandered our fiscal advantage, hollowed out our military, shattered our immigration system and shown little interest in our anemic productivity while economic, geopolitical and security threats to Canada rise to Defcon levels. If the Liberal Party cared about more than just itself, it would think about the risks we are facing on national unity and the sovereignty of the country not to mention Mr. Trump’s threats. It urgently needs a new leader without the baggage of the dismal fiscal and economic track record of recent years, the post-national rhetoric that undermines our sense of nationhood and the symbol of the divisive carbon tax. Canada needs someone who can negotiate with the Trump administration in a pragmatic way, protecting our national interests while dealing effectively and quickly with irritants. But the frontrunning Conservative Party doesn’t appear to be looking out for Canada’s interests, either. If Conservatives cared about more than their party’s strong electoral prospects, they would assist – even better, lead – in building a strong, unified Team Canada approach to dealing with Mr. Trump. The simple math of the parliamentary calendar and length of federal electoral campaigns is that there can be no election held until early April or, in the event of prorogation, later in May. That leaves a lame-duck Trudeau government at the mercy of Mr. Trump for months in the absence of a concerted federal-provincial-private sector-American partners coalition to beat back the threat of 25-per-cent tariffs. Indeed, given Mr. Trump’s concerns about Chinese hegemony, such an alliance could broaden the conversation to strengthening the North American economy, rather than weakening it with bilateral tariffs. Meanwhile, the non-functioning House of Commons – the core institution of our democracy – bears a striking resemblance to Canada Post, which Canadians barely noticed was on strike. MPs should rise to the moment and pass legislation to tighten border security, crack down on drug smuggling and improve anti-money laundering rules – along with funding to support them – if we are to demonstrate to the Americans that we are credible. The Trump rollercoaster has not waited for the mere formality of his inauguration. Besides threatening punitive tariffs on Canada and Mexico and mocking Canada as the 51st state, the president-elect has promised immediate action on Ukraine while indicating that he wants to take back the Panama Canal, buy Greenland and rain terror upon the BRICS countries if they de-dollarize. Canada, as a supporter of Ukraine, has a direct interest in any settling of the conflict, and we need a clear position going in. Yet, the Trudeau government’s repeated failure to meet our NATO defence spending commitments will likely become an issue for Mr. Trump over the course of these discussions and could sideline us. Adding more fuel to the national dysfunction is the fact that the ramp-up to the 2026 renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will begin soon, likely with a new set of outrageous Trump demands. The question on American and Mexican minds: Who speaks credibly for Canada? In mid-June, Canada will host the 2025 G7 meeting. Mr. Trump will be at the peak of his powers and facing a weakened French President, a wounded Japanese Prime Minister, a stumbling British Prime Minister, a new German Chancellor and, if the polls are accurate, a new Canadian Prime Minister. But who is setting the agenda for this pivotal Western conclave? Only a functioning government can help us prepare for the many challenges 2025 will bring.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Lynch, Kevin",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 2, 2025",Political campaigns; Prime ministers; Sovereignty; Tariffs,,2025-01-02,The Globe and Mail
"Trudeau asked about his father's famous walk in the snow, 'Swifty bracelet' and Poilievre",2025.0,"Comedian Mark Critch landed a year-end interview with Justin Trudeau, touching on the prime minister's political struggles, divorce and Donald Trump. The conversation was recorded on Dec. 6, 10 days before Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's shocking resignation and the subsequent decision by the Prime Minister's Office to cancel all year-end interviews. It aired on CBC on New Year's Eve. Trudeau appears to break silence on Trump ribbing Kevin O'Leary says he wants to talk to Trump about a U.S.-Canada 'economic union' ""?Oh, 2024, what a garbage year, hey? We've all had a horrible 2024, but nobody's had a harder 2024 than you,"" Critch teased Trudeau at the beginning of their conversation. ""I mean, down and up in the polls, inflation, tariffs. Pierre Poilievre called you a wacko. I mean, just a garbage year. And for Canadians, it's been a great comfort that no matter how bad 2024 got, we could always say, 'You know what? At least we're not Justin Trudeau.' ""You had a hard year!"" The prime minister took Critch's comments well, joking and riffing with the cast member of This Hour Has 22 Minutes. ""You had the low point of the year. For you, you kind of embarrassed all Canadians when you were caught on tape dancing to Taylor Swift,"" Critch said as the prime minister took it in stride. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Taylor Swift concert in Toronto on Nov. 22, 2024. PHOTO BY X ""?I was in the mood. I was going on,"" Trudeau responded. ""You're wearing your Swifty bracelet,"" Critch pointed out. ""?How old are you? But you have to remember, you know, you can't really dance like no one is watching. You have to dance like someone is filming you on your phone,"" the comedian teased. ""?Well, that's just the, the era we're in right now,"" Trudeau retorted, playing off of Swift's latest Eras concert tour. Trudeau again dismissed Donald Trump's comments encouraging Canada to become the 51st state when asked about his November meeting with the president-elect at his Florida estate, Mar-A-Lago, the so-called ""winter White House."" ""?There was a lot discussed during those three hours That was an off-hand, jocular moment. I don't think it was serious, even from him."" Critch roasted Trump for tweeting an image of a Canadian flag against the backdrop of what appears to be Matterhorn, a prominent mountain in Switzerland. ""Is that our greatest defence? Is that Americans are really bad at geography?"" Critch asked, drawing the prime minister's laugh. ""I ?think our greatest offence is that we do things together across the border, and anything they do that will hurt us will also hurt them, and that's something that he doesn't want to do,"" Trudeau said.

'It hurts': Sophie Grégoire speaks on cutting ties and bouncing back from heartbreak Near the end of their brief conversation, Critch asked Trudeau if he saw any parallels with his father, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and his famous walk in the snow in 1984 that ultimately prompted his departure from the national stage. ""When my father was my age, he still had a dozen years of prime ministering ahead of him,"" replied Trudeau, who turned 53 on Christmas Day. Critch posited: ""?I think Pierre Poilievre is at 99 per cent in the polls. Do you think you can do this?"" to which Trudeau responded unequivocally: ""Yes."" FILE PHOTO: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President-elect Donald Trump are pictured dining at Mar-a-Lago last Friday night. ""Right now, we're in a moment where everything is difficult.

I believe Canadians rise to the occasion, and I am certainly not going to stop fighting at this moment where it's so important,"" Trudeau said. The comedian teased in an interview with Radio Canada on Wednesday that his prized conversation would likely ruffle feathers among members of the Fourth Estate.

Conservatives wasted no time pillorying Singh and the NDP for the mixed message, arguing it proves Singh's ""word is utterly worthless,"" in a statement from the party attributed to House Leader Andrew Scheer. ""After all, he voted confidence in his boss Justin Trudeau eight times after his big stunt where he 'ripped up'their costly coalition agreement,"" the statement reads. Angus,who has already announced he won't be running in the next federal election, said that Trudeau's political shelf life is likely to be limited anyway, after the dramatic resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Freeland resigned hours before she was set to deliver a fall economic statement that blew past the government's fiscal targets. In her resignation letter addressed to Trudeau posted on the social media site X, Freeland said she had argued for ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" in the face of serious economic threats from the United States. ""Ms. Freeland has done enormous damage to Mr. Trudeau and it's not clear how long this government will survive,"" said Angus, in an email to National Post. Since Freeland's resignation, Trudeau has weathered increasing calls from his own caucus to resign as leader, which would prompt a Liberal leadership race ahead of the upcoming federal election in 2025. Some political observers have speculated that Trudeau could shut down Parliament, either to resign and allow time for a leadership race or to reset his government's agenda before the upcoming election. Trudeau told his caucus that he would use the holidays to ""reflect"" on his future with the party. During a holiday ski trip to British Columbia, Trudeau has even faced the ire of passersby on the ski slopes, including a woman who told him to ""please get the f--out of B.C."" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long, who has been calling for Trudeau to step down since the summer, posted a letter from the Atlantic Liberal caucus addressed to the prime minister calling on him to resign. Atlantic caucus chair and Nova Scotia MP Kody Blois signed the letter, which argues that Canada needs new leadership to respond to tariff threats from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Blois also points to public comments by opposition leaders that they plan to vote non-confidence in the government when Parliament resumes.

"Proroguing Parliament to avoid a confidence vote was an iffy idea in 2008. It’s a terrible one in 2025.:   The Liberals may be pondering following in the Conservatives’ footsteps, but Harper had the better case to make",2024.0,"“Stephen Harper has used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances,” the Liberals’ 2015 platform complained. “We will not.” Well, that was then. Mr. Harper, it is true, had used the power to prorogue Parliament in the way the Liberals described: to escape certain defeat on a confidence vote, in December, 2008, and to cut short a parliamentary committee’s inquiries into the Afghan prisoners affair, in 2010. But the Liberals have proved no slouches in that department, whatever their protestations. Justin Trudeau prorogued in 2020, in almost identical circumstances to Mr. Harper’s in 2010: to cut short a committee’s inquiries, this time into the grant of a billion-dollar contract to a charity that had hired his mum. And now the Liberals are reportedly thinking of restaging the 2008 crisis. Facing almost certain defeat in a confidence vote when Parliament returns next month, , various people in the party have raised the possibility of proroguing – either to give the Prime Minister time to think of a way out, or to give the party time to hold a leadership race to replace him, or just to stave off the inevitable. But the gist of the proposal, as it was in 2008, is to allow the government to carry on governing, in defiance of the wishes of a majority of the House. Entertaining as it is to watch the two sides debate who are the bigger hypocrites – Liberals: I can’t believe you Tories! You supported prorogation in 2008 but now you’re against it. Conservatives: The nerve of you Liberals! You opposed prorogation in 2008 but now you’re for it. – it remains a terrible idea. If anything, Mr. Harper had the better case to make. The two situations are not identical. In 2008 the House had barely returned from that fall’s election before the opposition parties announced, not only that they were ready to defeat the government, but that they had agreed to form a coalition government in its place, which they petitioned the then Governor-General, Michaëlle Jean, to accept. It was to forestall that possibility that Mr. Harper advised her to prorogue instead. In the present case, the government’s defeat would not lead to anything so novel. More than three years after the last election, there isn’t any doubt what would happen: the House would be dissolved, and a new election held. In 2008 Mr. Harper argued prorogation was needed to prevent a weak and unstable coalition from taking power. Mr. Trudeau could make no such argument today. There was, moreover, some merit in Mr. Harper’s argument, self-serving as it may have been. There’s nothing wrong with coalitions, in principle, just as there is nothing wrong with prorogation, in principle. But the coalition proposed in 2008 was an extraordinarily rickety contraption. The Liberals had just come off their worst election showing in their history (to then). Their leader had already announced he would step down. They were in no condition to be governing anything. Then that same leader agreed to form a coalition government with the NDP, with the Bloc Québécois propping it up. It seemed unlikely the arrangement could last more than six months, but in the meantime the Liberals – divided, demoralized and desperate to avoid another election – were obviously vulnerable to blackmail, and by a separatist party to boot. All of this in the middle of the worst economic crisis in two generations. That wasn’t necessarily enough to make the case for prorogation. But it gave the Governor-General something to think about. And in the end she acceded to Mr. Harper’s request. That was probably the right decision. Whatever advice she may have received from the opposition parties about their intention to vote no confidence in future, they had not yet actually done so. Until that happened, Mr. Harper was still her prime minister, and she was still constitutionally bound to follow his advice. It was, to say the least, a highly unusual situation. Mr. Harper arguably did her a favour. Had the confidence vote gone ahead, the Governor-General would have faced a terrible dilemma: hand the government over to an unstable coalition at the mercy of a separatist party, or plunge the country into another election, less than two months after the last. Prorogation may have been the least bad option of the three. Again, no such dilemma would face today’s Governor-General. Improper as it may be for Mr. Trudeau to ask for prorogation solely to escape defeat on a confidence vote, until the vote actually takes place Mary Simon would be bound to take his advice. It would be the right answer, but it would not make the question any less wrong.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Coyne, Andrew",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 31, 2024",Leadership; Opposition parties; Governor General-Canada; Coalition governments; Prime ministers,,2024-12-31,The Globe and Mail

Kelly McParland: Is Poilievre brave enough to take on Canada' s airlines?,2024.0,"Not that he needs any help, given the aid he's getting from the self-destructing Liberals, but if Pierre Poilievre wants an easy way to win votes, he could please a lot of Canadians by pledging to compel Canada's airlines to treat their customers with greater respect. It wouldn't take much: for instance, a passenger rights bill with actual teeth, that places the onus on airlines rather than passengers and is rigorously enforced. A rights document does exist, but, as so often, Justin Trudeau's Liberals have talked big but delivered small: the backlog of passenger complaints to the Canadian Transportation Agency this year hit 71,000, a new record. And no wonder. In May, a survey by consumer analytics firm J.D. Power found Air Canada - Canada's biggest airline, the one with the country's name emblazoned on its aircraft - placed last among 11 North American airlines in customer satisfaction for business class and premium economy tickets, and ninth for economy class. In January it was ranked last of 10 large airlines in on-time performance, meeting promised schedules just 63 per cent of the time. In yet another ranking, this time by AirHelp, which offers assistance to passengers with compensation claims, Air Canada placed 91st out of 112 international carriers, just ahead of Vietnam Airlines. Westjet does slightly better, but is no world-beater, while budget airlines struggle to make a dent in a system that is weighted towards the bigger carriers. Three low-cost ventures - Swoop, Lynx and Canada Jetlines - have quit service in the past 18 months, joining a list of earlier efforts that couldn't survive the muscle of the bigger, richer twosome that dominate Canada's skies with official acquiescence. But while finances and predatory competition may be behind the dearth of air travel options, it's the ill-treatment of paying customers that grates on so many nerves. The most recent blunder to attract attention involved the forced cancellation of a sold-out Toronto concert featuring British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who booked a last-minute ticket on Air Canada after another airline cancelled his flight, only to run into an agent who banned Kanneh-Mason's cello - more than 300 years old and worth millions - from a seat that had been reserved for it. The airline requires seats for instruments be bought at least 48 hours before take-off, with exceptions evidently unthinkable even in cases of passengers caught by circumstances beyond their control, or involving nothing more threatening than a cello. The cello fiasco followed soon on a small-claims court decision ordering Air Canada to pay $10,000 to a Yukon couple the judge said were ""treated shamefully"" by the airline. After spending three years planning a vacation trip to Cuba, the couple set off on their holiday only to be subjected to a series of diversions that ultimately found them in Mexico rather than Cuba, trying to salvage a few remaining days at their own expense in the face of bland indifference from the airline. Citing ""numerous breaches"" of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations, Justice Katherine McLeod called it ""extraordinary"" that ""without this small claims court action, no person-to-person communication would have taken place."" ""Moreover, there has been no acknowledgement of the difficulties suffered or even an apology for the complete lack of care."" While plenty egregious enough, neither instance matches the sheer shoddiness of the treatment meted out to two women thrown off an Air Canada flight because they declined to sit in vomit. The pair, headed from Las Vegas to Montreal, detected a foul smell from their designated seats. Turned out a previous occupant had been sick, and the crew hadn't had time for a proper clean-up. Instead, according to a passenger seated nearby, they tried to mask it with coffee grounds and some perfume. When the passengers remained reluctant - complaining the seatbelt remained wet and vomit was still visible - a pilot appeared on the scene to announce they could leave the plane of their own accord and expense, or be kicked off and placed on a no-fly list, punishment for not being pleasant enough about their situation. Next thing they knew, security arrived and hustled them off the plane. While the cello story made the New York Times, the vomit incident attracted CNN, the BBC, People magazine, YouTube, the Washington Post and other international outlets ... valuable media acreage if you're looking for attention, which in this case, of course, the airline wasn't. Air Canada eventually issued a statement acknowledging the two passengers ""clearly did not receive the standard of care to which they were entitled,"" and it was ""addressing their concerns,"" which hopefully included a big cheque. But bad headlines are a recurring feature for Canada's airlines, which were recently hauled before a House of Commons committee for questioning after eliminating fee-free carry-on baggage on some basic flights. Air Canada noted it was just the latest to start the practice after Porter and Westjet adopted similar policies. Porter CEO Michael Deluce said the fare offers a cheap option for passengers travelling with minimal baggage, while WestJet CEO Alexis Von Hoensbroech maintained Ottawa is to blame for high ticket costs thanks to the weight of taxes, fees, security costs, improvement levies and other charges it tacks onto fares. ""The way (air travel) is being governed actually has created a sky-high cost structure at a below-average infrastructure,"" he said. He has a point, but if airlines are going to pass their costs onto customers, they have a duty to deliver services to match. Other countries do a far better job of protecting passengers. European Union regulations are clearly spelled out, cover 27 countries and numerous outposts, and specify that the ""obligations that it creates should rest with the operating air carrier who performs or intends to perform a flight, whether with owned aircraft, under dry or wet lease, or on any other basis."" Poilievre has accused corporate Canada of ""sucking up"" to Liberals and distanced himself from its embrace. A pledge to put real muscle into passenger rights would be an excellent way to put bite behind the boasting.

"Public servants: From here on, expect change; Poilievre's policies likely to soon set the agenda",2024.0,"To the esteemed members of the public service, As the calendar prepares for its switch to 2025, it is time to take stock of 2024 and what it portends for the new year. First, the obvious: There is likely to be a change in the political control of the government. To put things bluntly, it would take a miracle (Christmas or otherwise) for Pierre Poilievre to not become prime minister in the first quarter of the new year, now that NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has indicated his intention of moving a vote of no confidence in the Liberal government. What's more, the current Conservative advantage in the polls translates into a size and strength of government that will be unlike anything we have seen in the modern age. Forget the first minority Harper government in 2006. Forget even the 2011 Harper majority. It is likely to be a record majority. As a result, Canadians are going to expect significant change and they will be expecting the public service to deliver that change. And the public service is likely going to have to do so as a smaller team. Its numbers have grown - and grown enormously - under the current Liberal government. In 2015, the number was under 258,000. As of today, it is just under 368,000, which represents an expansion of some 43 per cent. Expect the head count to come down, in some places significantly. There is no point bemoaning this fact. It doesn't matter what your politics are. Yes, you are here to advise the government of the day. But in the end, and after providing that fearless advice, you are also here to deliver the mandate of the government elected by the Canadian people. So public servants would do well to pay particular attention to the policy priorities of the modern Conservative Party of Canada. The carbon tax will go. House building will become (even more of) a priority. Budgets will be reduced. And criminal justice policy will once again become more aggressive. Government workers will, of course, be busy elsewhere too. Canada's foreign policy, for one, will take on a new posture. And those of you working in immigration are already toiling hard to reshape our core programs. We can expect this work to continue at pace. We have lost the pan-Canadian acceptance of our historically high immigration levels and we will have to work hard to re-establish control over the numbers, especially if the incoming American administration does what it says it will do with respect to a crackdown on illegal immigrants. Indeed, the incoming Trump administration will provide a number of challenges to our country's government. An already increasingly unpredictable world is going to throw up even more wild cards. It is perhaps trite to observe at this point that we are now a long way from the heady days of 2015, which is the last time this vast team of bureaucrats faced a change of administration. Ten years ago, public servants felt that their efforts were about to be more fully appreciated. Ten years on, many are sitting down with their families in apprehension this holiday period. What I propose is to make this challenge an opportunity. For there is an advantage to be had. What the current prime minister has described as a ""post-national state,"" i.e. Canada, is once again about to feel acutely aware of its Canadianness in the face of Donald Trump. There is work everyone can do to make Canada (even) great(er) again. As Marcus Aurelius once said: ""The blazing fire makes flames and brightness out of everything thrown into it."" As Friedrich Nietzsche put it: ""Amor fati"", i.e. love your fate. And if that's too highbrow for you, you can try this: ""If life gives you lemons, make lemonade."" Happy New Year.

'They don't need to make this so easy'; Dear diary; A look at the imagined thoughts of a strategist with the conservative party of canada,2024.0,"As Canada enters 2025, the Conservative party is riding a historic high in the polls that only seems to grow stronger with each passing week. The party has long been poised to win a majority in the next election, but amid the very public self-immolation of the Trudeau government, the Tories are now looking at the possibility of a victory so total that the Liberals won't even form opposition in the next Parliament. In Dear Diary, the National Post satirically re-imagines a week in the life of a newsmaker. This week, Tristin Hopper takes a journey inside the thoughts of a Conservative strategist. MONDAY Do you have any idea how hard it was to be a Conservative in Canada? For years, the strategy was the same: Hang up a pride flag, flinch if anyone said ""abortion,"" and pretend you didn't hear if they ever asked about health-care reform. Then, once voters become sufficiently disillusioned with the Liberals every generation or so, they might accidentally give you a minority government. But now? No matter what we promise, the poll numbers go up. Defund the CBC. Slash the budget. Lock up criminals. Cut immigration. Don't touch our guns. It's all working. Just the other day, our leader publicly said it was a bad thing to put males in women's prisons if they self-identify as transgender. Half the comms staff had a panic attack just thinking about it ... but it was fine. The Toronto Star didn't even bother to accuse us of trans genocide. TUESDAY We're not stupid. We know that we can't beat the NDP when it comes to free government stuff. If we promise a $15 minimum wage, they just promise a $30 minimum wage. If we promise a guaranteed minimum income, they'll just promise everyone a guaranteed minimum helicopter. But they didn't need to give us a monopoly on the issue of, say, not being stabbed. I'm no student of the left, but you can seize the means of production without constantly giving bail to armed psychos. And, again, it's not like they'll ever have to put their ideas into practice. All they have to do is say ""constant random stabbings by criminals on bail is bad"" ... and then offer some wildly unworkable solution to fix it, like postal banking or subsidized groceries. ""The NDP has a plan to fix all the stabbings,"" they could say. But that day never comes. I can't imagine they're pro-stabbing, and yet the issue is left to us. WEDNESDAY I sometimes wonder if my political powers have become supernatural. I'm serious; it's as if I have some kind of effect over my political rivals. I merely picture what I want them to do ... and it happens. I sensed it all the way back in 2019. I joked with friends, ""Wouldn't it be wild if a bunch of minstrel photos of Trudeau came out?"" One time over beers I mused, ""What if Trudeau inaugurates Truth and Reconciliation Day to use it as an excuse to slip away for a surf vacation?"" I didn't dare think either of these things would happen but ... there it was. Am I doing this? THURSDAY ""Ski. Go skiing. Leave Ottawa. Take a jet to an expensive ski resort and ski,"" I thought, staring at a portrait of Trudeau. Seemingly within minutes, he was on a jet and seemingly on his way to a ski vacation. And not somewhere close like Mont Tremblant. A B.C. resort that required burning several bathtubs of taxpayer-funded jet fuel just to get there. No ... it couldn't be. FRIDAY I'm being irrational. I'm losing my mind. There's no way I can control the minds of rival politicians. It's all just a coincidence. But then I pulled up an image of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. ""Denounce the government. Call it corrupt. Call it damaging to workers. Say Canadians are waiting for a change. Then prop it up. Vote yes in confidence votes. Say prorogation is necessary for 'stability.'Drive a Maserati.

WestJet does slightly better, but is no world-beater, while budget airlines struggle to make a dent in a system that is weighted toward the bigger carriers. Three low-cost ventures - Swoop, Lynx and Canada Jetlines - have quit service in the past 18 months, joining a list of earlier efforts that couldn't survive the muscle of the bigger, richer twosome that dominate Canada's skies with official acquiescence. But while finances and predatory competition may be behind the dearth of air travel options, it's the ill-treatment of paying customers that grates on so many nerves. The most recent blunder to attract attention involved the forced cancellation of a sold-out Toronto concert featuring British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who booked a last-minute ticket on Air Canada after another airline cancelled his flight, only to run into an agent who banned Kanneh-Mason's cello - more than 300 years old and worth millions - from a seat that had been reserved for it. The airline requires seats for instruments be bought at least 48 hours before take-off, with exceptions evidently unthinkable even in cases of passengers caught by circumstances beyond their control, or involving nothing more threatening than a cello. The cello fiasco followed soon on a small-claims court decision ordering Air Canada to pay $10,000 to a Yukon couple the judge said were ""treated shamefully"" by the airline. After spending three years planning a vacation trip to Cuba, the couple set off on their holiday only to be subjected to a series of diversions that ultimately found them in Mexico rather than Cuba, trying to salvage a few remaining days at their own expense in the face of bland indifference from the airline. Citing ""numerous breaches"" of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations, Justice Katherine McLeod called it ""extraordinary"" that ""without this small claims court action, no person-to-person communication would have taken place."" ""Moreover, there has been no acknowledgment of the difficulties suffered or even an apology for the complete lack of care."" While plenty egregious enough, neither instance matches the sheer shoddiness of the treatment meted out to two women thrown off an Air Canada flight because they declined to sit in vomit. The pair, headed from Las Vegas to Montreal, detected a foul smell from their designated seats. Turned out a previous occupant had been sick, and the crew hadn't had time for a proper cleanup. Instead, according to a passenger seated nearby, they tried to mask it with coffee grounds and some perfume. When the passengers remained reluctant - complaining the seatbelt remained wet and vomit was still visible - a pilot appeared on the scene to announce they could leave the plane of their own accord and expense, or be kicked off and placed on a no-fly list, punishment for not being pleasant enough about their situation. Next thing they knew, security arrived and hustled them off the plane. While the cello story made the New York Times, the vomit incident attracted CNN, the BBC, People magazine, YouTube, the Washington Post and other international outlets ... valuable media acreage if you're looking for attention, which in this case, of course, the airline wasn't. Air Canada eventually issued a statement acknowledging the two passengers ""clearly did not receive the standard of care to which they were entitled,"" and it was ""addressing their concerns,"" which hopefully included a big cheque. But bad headlines are a recurring feature for Canada's airlines, which were recently hauled before a House of Commons committee for questioning after eliminating fee-free carry-on baggage on some basic flights. Air Canada noted it was just the latest to start the practice after Porter and WestJet adopted similar policies. Porter CEO Michael Deluce said the fare offers a cheap option for passengers travelling with minimal baggage, while WestJet CEO Alexis Von Hoensbroech maintained Ottawa is to blame for high ticket costs thanks to the weight of taxes, fees, security costs, improvement levies and other charges it tacks on to fares. ""The way (air travel) is being governed actually has created a sky-high cost structure at a below-average infrastructure,"" he said. He has a point, but if airlines are going to pass their costs on to customers, they have a duty to deliver services to match. Other countries do a far better job of protecting passengers. European Union regulations are clearly spelled out, cover 27 countries and numerous outposts, and specify that the ""obligations that it creates should rest with the operating air carrier who performs or intends to perform a flight, whether with owned aircraft, under dry or wet lease, or on any other basis."" Poilievre has accused Corporate Canada of ""sucking up"" to Liberals and distanced himself from its embrace. A pledge to put real muscle into passenger rights would be an excellent way to put bite behind the boasting.

Kudos for Tory plan to 'defund' antisemitism; Poilievre makes Christmas Eve promise,2024.0,"This week marked the 10th Christmas Canadians have endured under Justin Trudeau's Liberal government - 10 years of our Dec. 25th-born prime minister acting as if he's our very own personal Jesus, without the humility, common sense, or moral clarity his birthday might suggest. From the get-go, Trudeau's been a means to an end for Liberal party power - a famous name, flowing hair, a convenient professionally-good-looking object many lonely Canadian wives cast their adoring gazes upon - but otherwise, intellectually and morally vacuous. Thankfully, there is a solution. Pierre Poilievre will bring the common sense and moral clarity Canada so desperately needs. On Christmas Eve, Poilievre, leader of the Opposition, tweeted out a promise to Canadians and we should hold him to it: ""I will defund wokism and fight antisemitism. And stand with our friends in Israel against terror."" It included a link to a statement from a telephone interview he gave last week to the Winnipeg Jewish Review. In the statement, Poilievre did not mince words. He promised to ""defund"" ""all of those with a woke antisemitic agenda."" His promise applies to ""everything that the federal government controls,"" and anyone ""imposing a radical, terrifying, toxic ideology."" He promised to ""fire government officials throughout (his) administration who are imposing a toxic woke ideology."" This would include universities, museums, and government-funded projects. ""The (Canadian Museum of Human Rights) will be there to honour our history and to tell our stories, not to impose toxic woke ideologies against our people,"" he assured the Winnipeg Jewish Review. Poilievre seems to inherently understand that a self-effacing people are not a people at all. Sadly, the same common sense cannot be attributed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who constantly apologizes for Canada and Canadians, whether it's warranted to do so or not. As prime minister, Justin Trudeau will forever be known as Canada's constant underminer. Poilievre, on the other hand, pointed out that he and his government would never fund antisemites, like Trudeau's Liberals did when they awarded Laith Marouf's advocacy group with more than $133,000, supposedly to combat racism. The total amount granted to Marouf was about $500,000. It was the same Laith Marouf who shamelessly took to social media to post: ""You know all those loud mouthed bags of human feces, a.k.a. the Jewish White Supremacists; when we liberate Palestine and they have to go back to where they come from, they will return to being low voiced bitches of thier (sic) Christian/Secular White Supremacist Masters"" and who boasted he'd form ""Zionist-Hunter squads"" among other colourful threats. Marouf was eventually fired from his government contract, but remained employed for a whole month after Diversity and Inclusion Minister Ahmed Hussen had been aware of Marouf's extremism. You see, news of his extremism hadn't hit the news yet. And no one appears to have been fired for hiring Marouf in the first place - a move Canadians can be confident Poilievre has the common sense and moral clarity to make. Other moral-clarity illustrating promises Poilievre made during his interview include: Lifting the nonsensical ban on the sale of military equipment to Israel Reversing the Liberal government's promise to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal, if he were to land on Canadian soil, based on the International Criminal Court's ridiculous charge he was starving civilians as a method of warfare, while aid trucks were pouring into Gaza and being captured by Hamas, and Defunding UNRWA, which the Liberals disingenuously pretended to pause, and whose schools are known to indoctrinate Palestinian children to murder Jews and whose members are becoming harder and harder to distinguish from Hamas itself. Poilievre also promised to make Canada safer, by performing the much-needed security screening our current government apparently doesn't deem necessary or finds boring. ""We will also screen incoming immigrants"" in an effort to ensure they ""have no terrorist links,"" he said on the call. He followed up with a promise to address what we've been seeing in our streets since October 7: ""there will be a crackdown on all terrorist networks that Trudeau has allowed on our streets."" To accomplish this, he told Winnipeg Jewish Review that laws will be passed and serious consequences will be doled out. Tackling radicalism in the streets will no doubt prove tricky to pull off. But this strong message, one we could never expect from our current mealy-mouthed leader, will no doubt be appreciated by those tired and frightened by chants for ""intifada"" in our streets. It will take a common-sense leader with moral clarity to, without apologies, return Canada to its rightful status of nation and begin its redefinition. Because, if we as a nation fail to define ourselves, someone else will happily do it for us.

Pierre Poilievre and his Manitoba polling bromance,2024.0,"You may have noticed, based on the most recent poll, that a majority of decided Manitoba voters are casting their lot with the Trump-like populism of the federal Conservative Party. Well, let me rephrase that — a significant majority of Manitoba men are ready to vote conservative. Because when you take a closer look at the poll, it’s men not women who are giving the Conservatives the lead. Decided women voters, it turns out, are fairly evenly split between the Liberals and Tories with the NDP running third. So why is that? Why are men and not women flocking to the Conservatives in such large numbers? What is it that these men like about Poilievre and don’t like about Trudeau or Singh? I could think of a few speculative answers to that question but my aim here is not to alienate the guys in the room, but rather to appeal to them, based on the facts, to rethink their political choice. So let’s assume the men in this cohort have at least one woman in their lives — a mother, a wife, a sister or a child — and that they want what’s best for that relative. Let’s also agree that, like 90 per cent of us, they support universal health care and most believe climate change is real. The latter being a pretty safe bet, given that some 80 per cent of Canadians believe climate change is driving extreme weather, and as many as 75 per cent agree it’s due to human activity. Finally, let’s assume that all of these men love their kids and grandkids, if they have any, and want what’s best for them, and that a number of them may be struggling to make ends meet in a price-gouging economy. Now, supposing all of that to be true, then all the men out there who are conservative supporters might want to consider what the Conservative Party has voted against in the last few years that will impact them, their kids and the women they love. Let’s start with your kids. Perhaps you don’t know that the Conservatives recently voted against the Liberal’s $10 a day childcare support program, as well as a national food program for schools and funding for a kids hotline. They also voted against a dental plan for seniors and have threatened to cut other key services. You might also be surprised to learn that the Conservatives voted against government support to end gender-based violence and have repeatedly voted “no” to a woman’s right to choose. In fact, 74 per cent of the Conservative caucus is anti-choice, according to a national rights coalition. The Tories also appear to be gung-ho on guns, having voted against stronger gun control, and don’t seem too worried about the rural vote, given that they just rejected support for Canadian farmers. And what of the Conservative leader’s election promises? Well, Poilievre has promised to “lay waste” to the Liberal’s climate and energy policies. To that end, he has promised that oil tankers will once again prowl the coast off northern B.C., the carbon tax will be axed, and emission caps will go the way of the dodo bird. Worse still, he has no clear alternative plan to reduce emissions. All of this while other countries are in the midst of a green energy transition. Which means that our economy, including the creation of new green jobs, will lag behind other nations that are busy investing in clean energy. If that wasn’t bad enough, Poilievre has consistently refused to undergo a security clearance. As a result, he can’t be briefed on classified information, including that pertaining to Conservative MPs — himself included — who may, wittingly or unwittingly, be linked to foreign interference schemes. Read here, the American Republican Party, Musk, Putin and other foreign players. Why is he refusing? Well, according to Poilievre, allowing a security check would compromise his ability to critique the government’s actions on limiting foreign election interference. And if you believe that, I also have bridge in Brooklyn I can sell you. Finally, and perhaps most egregiously, Poilievre has thrown Canadians under the bus by parroting Trump’s false claims that Canada is exporting huge amounts fentanyl into the U.S. A fiction concocted by Trump to justify his threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian goods. And if that doesn’t sway you, consider this: We Manitobans just rejected the provincial conservatives after an eight year austerity program that gutted our health-care system, denied workers a living wage and did less than nothing to address climate change. Now consider that on a national scale. If that doesn’t convince you to ditch your bromance with Poilievre then I guess nothing will. Erna Buffie is a writer and filmmaker.

WNBA's Caitlin Clark is making everyone around her wealthier,2024.0,"Bulls of the year It was a huge year for the business of sport, with Caitlin Clark and the WNBA leading the charge in a game-changing year for women's basketball. She's not alone but she is clearly the poster child for the new economic reality for women's team sports. Clark is making everyone around her wealthier. Explosive growth in media rights fees and overall revenues reaching the stage where several North American pro sports teams posted more than 30 per cent increases in franchise valuation, year-over-year. The television juggernaut that is the National Football League - which we've dubbed the new social network - closes out 2024 with an average franchise value of US$5.7 billion according to Forbes magazine. When your weakest links are still worth $4 billion and have grown by about 70 per cent since the pandemic, there's no one to feel sorry for. That's especially true when recent streaming deals will only drive more NFL revenue and audience in the years to come. Amazon Prime paid $100 million for the Black Friday stream last month while Netflix offered up $150 million for the NFL Christmas Day doubleheader that averaged 24 million, peaked at 27 million for a Beyonce half-time show and rallied more than 65 million unique viewers for at least part of the two games played on Wednesday of this week. Also having bullish years in 2024: Alternate telecasts, stadium design, podcasts and collectibles. More to come on those fronts in 2025. Chicago Bears interim head coach Thomas Brown, centre, looks at the scoreboard during the first half of an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions on Sunday, Dec. 22, 2024, in Chicago. Bears of the year It was already an historically bad year for the Chicago White Sox, the Major League Baseball franchise that set an all-time mark for futility despite having the advantages of operating in the third largest market in the U.S. Yet leave it to the Chicago Bears of the NFL to give them a run for the money as one of the biggest losers in the business of sport this year. The Bears (6-3 losers to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday Night Football this week) have now lost a record 10 straight games after starting the season at 4-2. Outside of deep playoff runs by the New York Yankees, New York Mets and New York Red Bulls, the Big Apple has been largely rotten in 2024. The biggest media market in North America has not one but two also-rans in the NFL (the 2-13 Giants in the NFC and the 4-11 Jets in the AFC), not to mention the New York Rangers, who are an absolute mess at the Christmas break despite being the second-richest franchise in the NHL according to both Forbes and Sportico. Meanwhile, the Oakland Athletics are no more after one of the messiest and protracted break ups in North American team sport. After more than two decades of on-again, off-again talks about a new stadium in Oakland finally collapsed, the Athletics will play in Sacramento for three seasons while they work with Las Vegas stakeholders to fund and construct a new ballpark at the site of the Tropicana Hotel. Once one of the most storied blue collar sport markets in North America, Oakland is now a shell of its former self, with the Golden State Warriors of the NBA now playing at the Chase Center in San Francisco, the Oakland Raiders in Las Vegas and the old California Seals long ago morphed into the Cleveland Barons, merged with the Minnesota North Stars and ultimately relocated to Dallas in 1993.

Pierre Poilievre - take note of Liz Truss's ensnarement: How FP columnists saw it in 2024,2024.0,"Read excerpts from columns that appeared in July, August and September 2024 in FP Comment. Third in a series. July During their debate Joe Biden and Donald Trump engaged in silly finger-wagging about who had expanded the deficit most. But neither had any sort of plan to deal with mounting deficits and mountainous debt. Consolidated government gross debt has reached 123 per cent of U.S. GDP, heading for 134 per cent in 2030. With rising interest rates, Democrats' devotion to more spending and Republicans' to tax cuts means the debt can only rise, and with it the likelihood of financial stress. That incumbent governments are floundering should surprise no one. This week it's happening in the U.K. and France. This fall and next year it may happen in the U.S. and Canada. You mess up economically and voters punish you. To paraphrase Bill Clinton: ""It's almost always the economy, stupid."" - Jack Mintz, July 5 Taxpayers need to question whether every new government intervention in the economy generates net benefits to society. Too often what Oscar Wilde once remarked seems to be true: ""The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of an expanding bureaucracy."" With so many bureaucrats milling about, decisions slow down as files are passed from one to another. Accountability is lost. Departments point fingers at each other, as we have seen in the ArrriveCan debacle. New programs are hatched and more employees hired whether they are needed or not. With work-from-home, less gets done as unsupervised employees walk the dog or do the shopping. - Jack Mintz, July 9 Where is Ottawa's climate commissar Stephen Guilbeault on cheap Chinese EVs? You'd think Minister World-on-Fire would be delighted to see even conservative enviro-skeptics such as myself being tempted by an attractive but cheap and apparently safe and efficient EV like China's Seagull. At last, an EV that ordinary middle-class Canadians, not just preening upper-middle class ones, could actually afford. What better way to effect the transition to EVs - deadline less than 11 years from now, remember - than with market incentives? - William Watson, July 11 Conservative Partly leader Pierre Poilievre recently said that if elected he would appoint a task force to examine tax reform He said the panel would be composed of ""entrepreneurs, inventors, farmers and workers"" and would be given the mandate of simplifying and lowering taxes. It is notable that Poilievre would avoid a task force of experts or a Royal Commission, such as the 1966 report headed by Kenneth Carter, to examine the tax system. Taxation is too important to be based on a John Rawlsian thought-experiment as to what an ideal tax regime would look like. Poilievre has the political savvy and grasp of history to avoid asking the opinions of academics and economists, who inevitably would recommend shifting from income to consumption taxes, such as the GST or carbon taxes Tax reform has to be based on changes Canadians are willing to tolerate, given that millions of households and firms have made long-term plans about their work and investments shaped by expectations of the taxes they will be compelled to pay. - Philip Cross, July 12 The Mike Harris Conservatives' failure to tackle the LCBO privatization deserves a capital 'F' for failure. Not only did it allow a consumer-gouging monopoly to survive as a cash machine for government, preventing the benefits of competition and market freedom. It also helped establish a state corporate control model that to this day influences policy making. One can only imagine how the continuing debate over the provision of other government services such as health care would have evolved if only the Harris ""revolutionaries"" had been willing to force the conversion of the LCBO into another competitor in a free-market-driven wholesale and retail sector. - Terence Corcoran, July 13 In his first remarks as British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer said his government would ""tread more lightly"" on people's lives. That does seem unlikely, coming from the head of the traditionally interventionist Labour Party, but it is badly needed now. What inflames people more than anything is the idea that others intend to outlaw their accustomed way of living, speaking or even thinking. The less we try do by force with law and the more we let social change take place organically and spontaneously, the less angry with each other we all are likely to be. - William Watson, July 16 How refreshing it is in this era of the New Protectionist/Interventionist State to read a full-throated defence of the grand, old liberal ideas of open markets, free competition, private ownership and level playing-fields. True, it's a little surprising that this defence comes from the Chinese Communist Party in the form of its 28-page statement responding to the World Trade Organization's 173-page triennial review of China's economic policies and practices. But in these days of worldwide cancellation of ""Adam Smith Thought"" you take whatever support is offered wherever by whomever. It's good that at least one of the world's major governments still seems to know the words to the great old hymns. - William Watson, July 25 A government that is diverted away from its basic functions by engaging in the nationalization of daycare, dental care, pharmacare and the automobile sector, and undertaking all sorts of other preposterous activities, like forcing all major grocery chains to sign a Grocery Code of Conduct, will neglect the basic functions of national defence and crime prevention. It is therefore not surprising that in Canada today, the military is a shambles and violent crime is rising alarmingly. - Matthew Lau, July 31 August Our tax system is pockmarked with so many preferences that the elimination of many tax credits could result in a substantial reduction of tax rates. Given our falling per capita GDP and lacklustre investment, tax reform could spur economic growth without affecting revenues or redistribution. With more revenues pouring in, maybe beleaguered taxpayers would benefit from tax reductions of the sort we saw two decades ago. - Jack Mintz, Aug. 16 Liz Truss' account of her experience as prime minister should be required reading for Poilievre's inner circle as they make plans to take power in Canada. They will face resistance to their agenda from a left-leaning civil service, special interest groups and the mainstream media. The speed at which major reforms are implemented should be carefully calibrated; former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, for example, knew she would need to win a second mandate before taking on Britain's powerful trade unions, and so devoted her first term to fiscal reform and confronting the Soviet Union. Managed properly, however, and supported by a united caucus, a Poilievre government should be able to avoid the crisis that ensnared Liz Truss. - Philip Cross, Aug. 20 Genuinely agreeing to disagree on important matters means exercising legislative and regulatory forbearance. There are things you keep discussing but decline to legislate on. And you certainly don't ram things through 51-49. There are other things you leave to local legislatures - which is where in the U.S., after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the law of abortion is now written. As a general matter, you refrain from using the nuclear option of absolutist ""rights talk."" If people insist their favoured policy involves ""a basic human right,"" where does that leave democratic compromise? Who can compromise on ""rights,"" after all? They're rights! We need to accept, grudgingly if necessary, that grudging acceptance is the democratic way. - William Watson, Aug. 22 In addressing productivity, we don't need a productivity minister, department, consultants or policy analysts. More than likely all their person-hours wouldn't add to output, they might even subtract from it. What we do need is for everyone working in an organization to ask: ""Is this person or activity really necessary to what we're trying to do here?"" And when the answer is no, act on it. - William Watson, Aug. 29 China's growth spurt after 1978 increasingly looks like similar episodes for the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1950s, Japan in the 1950s and 1960s and Brazil in the 1970s. Each was hailed at the time as having discovered a new elixir for economic growth. Instead, after an upswing based on adopting western technology and shifting resources from farms to industry, growth petered out, revealing these models as incapable of sustaining long-term expansion. China's faltering economic prospects mean that refocusing our trade on the U.S., not China, will be to Canada's advantage. - Philip Cross, Aug. 30 September When you have two cabinet ministers giving an average of $300,000 in taxpayer funding to 17 different organizations so they can be part of an ""ecosystem"" to organize awareness-raising, more-cohesive networks and still more ecosystems based on sexual orientation, this is not an entrepreneurship policy. It is a policy to give away $5.2 million of taxpayers' money to bureaucrats, activists, consultants, and lobbyists who specialize in writing, reviewing, and approving grants for public funds, and then spending those funds on things that will sound marketable in a government announcement. - Matthew Lau: Sept. 4 In 2021, Statcan asked ""Has the COVID-19 pandemic changed commuting patterns for good?"" The answer is clearly yes: it has reinforced our aversion to public transit. Which means the billions of dollars governments are pouring into mass transit, bike lanes and foot paths risk becoming stranded assets. - Philip Cross, Sept. 5 Kamala Harris doesn't say much about her Canadian years, but it's hard to believe her time here did not have some impact on her ""values."" To an almost eerie degree, the Harris campaign echoes Justin Trudeau's winning 2015 campaign Trudeau favoured ""sunny ways,"" referring back to Wilfred Laurier's quip that ""the sun's warm rays are better than winter's bluster."" Harris is pushing ""joy."" As both Trudeau and Harris talk a lot about fighting for the middle class it's not surprising their policy prescriptions are uncannily similar. - Jack Mintz, Sept. 13 Making it to the NHL requires significant athletic skill and investments in time; similarly, opening and successfully running a business requires operational ability and investments of capital (which can be borrowed or raised by aspiring entrepreneurs who have ability but lack financing). People should no more receive taxpayer handouts because they dream of owning a business than receive taxpayer handouts to pursue their dream of making the NHL. That people have dreams is not a reason for the federal government to give them other people's money. - Matthew Lau, Sept. 18 Jack Mintz: Canada can no longer afford a peace dividend Philip Cross: Ottawa proves it again: Human is as stupid does Terence Corcoran: A non-tariff plan to fight Chinese EVs According to the Toronto District School Board website, at the ALPHA Alternative School ""social/emotional learning, democratic decision-making, and social justice are foundations of our program,"" and ""students have considerable freedom to choose what, how and when they learn. We give individual feedback instead of grades or tests."" So this is a school where instead of taking tests, students learn about ""social justice"" by going on field trips to protest Israel.

Leigh Revers: Universities better get prepared for Poilievre's anti-woke agenda,2024.0,"The recent spectacular and decisive presidential election victory by Donald Trump - a self-styled benevolent ""dictator"" swept to power with an unequivocal mandate from U.S. voters - has become what can only be described as a political tsunami for left-leaning observers. Vast change is in the offing. The political tectonic plates have shifted, prompting shattering eruptions along a number of predictable fault lines. One such fiery volcano is gender ideology, a demonstrable fantasy that, mercifully, will soon be banished from American institutions, its many purveyors quickly to be bankrupted by Trump's proposed state-assisted lawsuits brought by the swelling ranks of detransitioners A second is education, a metaphorical marshmallow that is no longer merely the artificially-sweetened confection promised to so many young people, but has instead become more like a skewered and charred husk grilled remorselessly on the three-pronged toasting fork of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Anti-woke sentiment creeps into workplaces as views on DEI start to sour, research shows Howard Levitt: Woke is broke and Donald Trump's return confirms it Americans need worry no longer, however. In a recent post on X, Elon Musk shared Donald Trump's radical vision of a reformed college education system - one that demands the eradication of all DEI and its apparatchiks, and even threatens uncompliant institutions with severe taxation or complete forfeiture of their sprawling endowments. Inevitably, we will witness brazen back-peddling by the cadre of top-tier administrators desperate to remain gainfully employed. Harvard's board, sitting on a treasure horde of US$53.2B (C$74.8B), will doubtless respond accordingly. How will Canadian universities survive? While plunging needles into voodoo dolls of Pierre Poilievre, the left will eschew the 'scary' stateside politics, make accusations of neo-fascism, and point to Canada as a progressive retreat, a haven for the many orphans of woke ideology who, even now, are threatening on their social feeds to lay siege to our border, waving their American passports. But what is far more likely, judging from predictions by even the state-sponsored CBC which suggest with 99 per cent certainty a Conservative win in 2025, is that the Canadian government in a year's time will follow suit. Even the dullest minds in the upper administrations of Canada's top universities - and trust me, they are spectacularly dull - must see the writing on the wall. Here is the unvarnished reality in Canada in higher education in 2024. Students are being ripped off. Their degrees have been continuously devalued by the twin cudgels of enrolment inflation, as ballooning cohorts are funnelled through our universities, and the softening of standards in the face of academic appeasement and growing accommodations. You might raise an eyebrow at that last remark. Academic accommodations are a form of concessionism where, according to a recent reportat Queen's University, nearly one in four students (22 per cent) gain some kind of benefit, usually in the shape of extended time allotments for examinations, to correct for what is often a largely imagined state of mental impairment. Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. In short, if you get anxious, the university concedes that you deserve more time than everyone else. This hardly constitutes quality education, and it inevitably dilutes academic standards. Obsequious compassion is showered on the deserving minorities; but if you are a hard-working student with no stakes in the victimhood game, well, you just have to suck it up. Universities have consequently become expensive pre-adulthood training grounds that now choose to deride diligence, talent, and commitment in favour of equitable practices that attempt to champion anyone choosing to identify into minorities defined by inherent characteristics - gender, race, and sexuality. Indeed, their compulsive obsession with ""belonging"" - cited a mere 27 times, for example, in UofT's most recent 17-page DEI report - has all the allure of a brain hemorrhage. It will be interesting to see how they adapt to this new, inclement climate. For instance, in my own department, there are 40 staffers who support a suite of professional graduate programs. Based on published United Steel Workers' pay scales and benefit rates, this costs the university - a taxpayer-funded enterprise - well in excess of $3.5M per year. For a typical program, a quarter of the allotted budget is sucked up by administrative overhead. All of the appointees would doubtless declare graduate-school exceptionalism and, in the same breath, grouse about the ever-present patriarchy. But inspection shows only 24 per cent are men, and 40 per cent are, unsurprisingly, white women. Now, sandwiched between provincial funding cuts and a collapse in international student admissions, campuses like mine will have to muster major savings as budget holes dilate in an ever-gloomier climate. Punitive financial incentives imposed by an incoming Conservative government will doubtless see a rapid turnaround as academics and administrators alike rush to gaslight everyone claiming that woke waste - characterized so effectively by journalist Charlotte Gill in Britain - was all ""unintentional."" Pull the other one. Recent propaganda sheets such as The Bulletin of the Canadian Association of University Teacher and Academic Matters, the journal of the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, which purport to represent professors like myself, are awash with racist DEI and tout a slavish fealty to obsessive and damaging social justice ideology. If you belong to the editorial team of either of these absurd political pamphlets, please drop me from your mailing list. There is hope for students. Jordan Peterson has lately launched his academy, which, though limited to the social sciences so far, has breached the universities' monopoly and comes at a bargain price. And the content is excellent, featuring such stellar authorities as Andrew Roberts, James Orr, John Vervaeke, Eric Kaufmann and a host of others. I've signed up. Time is running out for legacy universities across Canada. I have a fancy next year we will see the same wave of comedy meltdowns that followed Trump's re-election, just this time by an army of capitulating academics.

"A movement, not a moment: 2024 was the biggest year for women’s sports:   From Summer McIntosh and Simone Biles on the Olympic stage, to Caitlin Clark and the rise of the PWHL, this past year was full of stories of exceptional female athletes doing unprecedented things",2024.0,"This was the year Summer McIntosh dominated the world in the Paris Olympic pool, the year a best-on-best women’s pro hockey league burst into existence. It was the year Caitlin Clark helped elevate women’s basketball into must-see TV and the year Toronto landed a coveted WNBA franchise. Simone Biles returned to the Olympic stage, after a mental-health layoff, and delivered a gold-medal performance that stretched the limits of gymnastics skill. Female athletes appeared more frequently on network TV and social-media feeds in 2024, as they seized medals, scored skillful goals, hit big buckets and turned their game day tunnels into fashion runways. I’ve been lucky to watch and write about sports for a living for 25 years, and a significant portion each year has focused on women. In 2024, more than any other year of my career, stories of exceptional female athletes doing unprecedented things dominated my work calendar. It will go down as the year the world began to care more widely about women’s pro sports and recognize their appeal – evidenced by record-setting live attendance and broadcast audiences for several leagues, from the WNBA to the National Women’s Soccer League, and the newly launched Professional Women’s Hockey League. One of the must-have fashion items of 2024 was a T-shirt with the words “Everyone watches women’s sports”, popularized by celebrities donning it at games. My e-mails and texts were filled with story pitches, news tips, fresh market research substantiating the business-case for women’s pro sport and press releases about new franchises, broadcast deals and sponsors jumping aboard. Can you name one person who doesn’t know who Caitlin Clark is after her unprecedented 2024? Long-time friends who have never cared about sports suddenly wanted to discuss women’s sports, especially Clark. The two-time college national player of the year out of the University of Iowa, who became a rookie star with the Indiana Fever, mesmerized audiences by repeatedly swishing audacious long-range threes. Her fire was wildly entertaining, all chest-pumping and arms stretched wide. Clark’s reach was immense. She set a women’s basketball NCAA Division 1 scoring record, then eclipsed Hall of Famer Pete Maravich’s overall mark as the NCAA’s top scorer. The college championship game between Iowa and South Carolina averaged 18.9 million viewers, the No. 2 most-watched women’s sporting event in U.S. TV history outside the Olympic Games. For the first time, a larger audience tuned in for the women’s NCAA championship than for the men’s. Drafted into the WNBA first overall, Clark set a rookie record for most points in a season (769). She also set WNBA marks for most assists – in a season (337) and in a single game (19). The 22-year-old endured hard fouls in her WNBA debut year and was left off the 2024 U.S. Olympic team, as fans and media drummed up tension around those narratives. Still, it was undeniable Clark propelled growth for the league. In July, the WNBA signed a historic 11-year media-rights deal with Disney, Amazon Prime and NBC valued at about US$200-million a year, Sportico reported. The WNBA drew a record of more than 54 million unique viewers across its broadcasts this season. Its overall attendance (2,353,735) jumped 48 per cent year over year. The Fever set the WNBA record for home attendance by a franchise, with many of their road games moved to bigger NBA and NHL rinks to accommodate the demand to see Clark. Time and The Associated Press each chose her their athlete of the year. Clark calls herself a fan of women’s sports and said during the Final Four, “I think you see it across the board, whether it’s softball, whether it’s gymnastics, volleyball. People want to watch. It’s just when they’re given the opportunity, the research and the facts show that people love it.” The PWHL illustrated that as it launched in 2024. Some 2.9 million Canadians viewed the PWHL’s first game – between Toronto and New York on Jan. 1 – across CBC, Sportsnet and TSN. It set attendance marks, especially in its Canadian markets, including the 21,105 who filled Montreal’s Bell Centre. Just barely into its second season, the six-team league has already began exploring expansion. It has increased opportunities to see top athletes – including Natalie Spooner, Marie-Philip Poulin and Sarah Nurse – that most fans only saw every four years during a Winter Olympics. Females provided many of the biggest headlines at the Paris Olympics. Biles was the Games’ most famous headliner, as she earned four medals and Performed the “Biles II”, the most difficult vault in women’s gymnastics. It was a rousing return four years after the American superstar had withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics to focus on her mental health. McIntosh, the teen sensation who swam to four medals and carried Canada’s flag at the closing of the Olympics, was another luminary to draw worldwide attention. She set two Olympic records and became the first Canadian to win three gold medals at one Games. The CBC said some 27 million Canadians watched its Paris coverage, with McIntosh’s performances accounting for some of the most-watched moments. Women’s soccer grew its audience this year, too. The NWSL averaged crowds of 11,250 during the regular season, the league’s best attendance mark. In its first season with 14 teams – up from 12 – the NWSL surpassed two million total fans for the first time in its 12-season history. Its championship game set a ratings mark for NWSL match viewership, with an average audience of 967,900 on CBS. The Northern Super League, Canada’s new women’s pro soccer league, took major steps toward its launch in April, 2025, announcing owners and branding for its six franchises, and signing its first players. And Canada landed a long-awaited WNBA franchise, which will begin play in 2026. The news conference, held in May to announce the team, was one of the largest I covered all year in Toronto. It drew an enormous crowd of media and celebrities, everyone from Drake to Kyle Lowry and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Excitement for the new team continued, as more than 10,000 people submitted ideas to name the club, before Toronto Tempo was chosen. I noticed a palpable shift in interest and image across women’s sports. Sold-out events became common place. The athletes became more influential and coveted by sponsors as teams and leagues elevated their game-day experiences and invested heavily in their own glossy-looking marketing content. More media turned out to report on the women. The industry is growing in all directions. There’s been a burst of new podcasts about women’s sports. Whoopi Goldberg launched an all-women’s sports network. Unrivaled, a 3x3 off-season basketball league built by players, will make its debut in January. And a new women’s pro baseball league will start in the United States in 2026. The barrage reminds me of a sentiment I heard during countless interviews in 2024: women’s sport is not having a ‘moment’; it’s a ‘movement’.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,,The Globe and Mail,"Dec 27, 2024",Franchises; Olympic games; Womens sports; Teams; Audiences; Celebrities; Athletes; Females; College basketball; Medals; Soccer,Nom: National Collegiate Athletic Association--NCAA; NAICS: 813990; Nom: Womens National Basketball Association; NAICS: 813990,2024-12-27,The Globe and Mail
"I lost my husband but I cherish this symbol:   The bagel ornament was the perfect metaphor for how our Jewish-Christian family rolled, Catherine Mulroney writes",2024.0,"The bagel ornament made its first appearance on our Christmas tree the year Mike and I married. I was pretty pleased with myself when I ran across it in a display at the now long-gone Simpson’s department store in downtown Toronto. Amid a series of trees decorated by theme, one tree was completely decked out in little bread ornaments. There, amid the baguettes and croissants, was a lone bagel. I snatched it up, knowing it was a perfect gift for my Jewish husband, who was about to celebrate his first Christmas. Mike and I were married in the early 1980s, when people still felt free to comment on what was then called a mixed marriage. While our families were supportive, we heard it all from just about everybody else – on both sides. I was called “Abie’s Irish Rose” by the guests at our wedding and then came the more invasive, “How will you raise the kids?” A question that started the very next day. So, including a bagel on our Christmas tree struck me as a pretty perfect metaphor for how we planned to roll, if you’ll excuse the pun. The bagel was tossed into Mike’s stocking that first Christmas, right next to some Hannukah gelt, and it was easily the best thing he received that year – or perhaps any year that followed. As he munched on his mixed nuts, he set aside the latest Robert Ludlum paperback and let the ornament dangle from his pointer finger, laughing goofily at the novelty. (For a man who grew to love Christmas more than just about anybody, stockings remained a mystery to Mike. Early on, he asked me about the custom, and I explained they contained little treats – “you know… the stuff you’d find at the drug store.” For decades to follow, my stocking would include a pack of Bic disposable razors. From the drug store. Pink, but still hard not to take too personally.) In the early years, it was natural for Mike to hang his special ornament himself. When our kids came along, however, and tree decorating became a chaotic free-forall, there was always a moment when someone unearthed the bagel ornament and it would be handed over to their dad. It was a sacred ritual, with our Catholic kids recognizing their dad for who he was – and for who their parents were as a couple. Eventually, the bagel began to show its age, developing a crack in its flimsy plastic shell. Our response was to treat it with greater care. This one was irreplaceable. When we would take the tree down at the end of the season, I began putting the ornament in my china cabinet knowing it would be safe from dust and damage. Mike died just days before the pandemic started. That Christmas, I discovered that I couldn’t find the bagel, and my heart broke all over again. I searched all the usual spots but it just didn’t turn up. I was furious with myself and agonized about telling my kids that the year they lost their dad I managed to lose a key symbol associated with him. The kids, of course, were sweet about it and that made me feel less awful about the loss. From time to time I would spend five minutes here or there ripping the house apart hunting for it. As so often happens, the missing item turned up when I wasn’t looking for it. It was tucked away at the back of the drawer where I keep things like the kids’ hospital bracelets from their deliveries, and notes from my mother. Clearly, in the fog of grief, I must have thought that, while I’d lost Michael, I was not going to lose this cherished symbol of our lives together. Our Christmases are different now. Rather than a family effort carrying a tree home, my youngest and I go off to the local fancy nursery where I pay through the nose for a perfect tree delivered by rent-ahusbands who set it up for us. Ever mindful of our loss, our ornaments now include a dreidel and a menorah, coopted from another purpose – a Hannukah bush, perhaps? – to brighten our tree. The kids even commissioned a porcelain Star of David ornament for me which features a little boy wearing a yarmulke with his arm around a little girl – a shiksa, we like to think. But, as always, high up the tree rests the bagel, once lost and now found. In recent years, the honour of placing the bagel on our tree has fallen to our youngest daughter, who was at her father’s side his entire illness. Our bagel is now watched more closely than ever. When it’s not on the tree, it rests on top of the chest holding Mike’s ashes. We always were an unorthodox family, and, while it might seem like a flip gesture, it is anything but. Like Proust’s madeleines or Citizen Kane’s Rosebud, this $2 ornament brings forth nothing but the happiest memories of a man well-loved and dearly missed – especially at Christmas.

Terry Newman: Poilievre's plan to 'defund' woke antisemitism can't come soon enough,2024.0,"This week marks the 10th Christmas Canadians have endured under Justin Trudeau's Liberal government - 10 years of our Dec. 25th-born prime minister acting as if he's our very own personal Jesus, without the humility, common sense, or moral clarity his birthday might suggest. From the get-go, Trudeau's been a means to an end for Liberal party power - a famous name, flowing hair, a convenient professionally-good-looking object many lonely Canadian wives cast their adoring gazes upon - but otherwise, intellectually and morally vacuous. Thankfully, there is a solution. Pierre Poilievre will bring the common sense and moral clarity Canada so desperately needs. On Christmas eve, Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Opposition, tweeted out a promise to Canadians and we should hold him to it: ""I will defund wokism and fight antisemitism. And stand with our friends in Israel against terror."" It included a link to a statement from a telephone interview he gave last week to the Winnipeg Jewish Review. I will defund wokism and fight antisemitism. And stand with our friends in Israel against terror. - Pierre Poilievre (@PierrePoilievre) December 24, 2024 In the statement, Poilievre did not mince words. He promised to ""defund"" ""all of those with a woke anti-Semitic agenda."" His promise applies to ""everything that the federal government controls,"" and anyone ""imposing a radical, terrifying, toxic ideology."" He promised to ""fire government officials throughout (his) administration who are imposing a toxic woke ideology."" This would include universities, museums, and government-funded projects. ""The (Canadian Museum of Human Rights) will be there to honour our history and to tell our stories, not to impose toxic woke ideologies against our people,"" he assured the Winnipeg Jewish Review. Poilievre seems to inherently understand that a self-effacing people are not a people at all. Sadly, the same common sense cannot be attributed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who constantly apologizes for Canada and Canadians, whether it's warranted to do so or not. As prime minister, Justin Trudeau will forever be known as Canada's constant underminer. Poilievre, on the other hand, pointed out that he and his government would never fund antisemites, like Trudeau's Liberals did when they awarded Laith Marouf's advocacy group with more than $133,000, supposedly to combat racism. The total amount granted to Marouf was about $500,000. It was the same Laith Marouf who shamelessly took to social media to post: ""You know all those loud mouthed bags of human feces, a.k.a. the Jewish White Supremacists; when we liberate Palestine and they have to go back to where they come from, they will return to being low voiced bitches of thier (sic) Christian/Secular White Supremacist Masters"" and who boasted he'd form ""Zionist-Hunter squads"" among other colourful threats. Marouf was eventually fired from his government contract, but remained employed for a whole month after Diversity and Inclusion Minister Ahmed Hussen had been aware of Marouf's extremism. You see, news of his extremism hadn't hit the news yet. And no one appears to have been fired for hiring Marouf in the first place - a move Canadians can be confident Poilievre has the common sense and moral clarity to make. Other moral-clarity illustrating promises Poilievre made during his interview include: .Lifting the nonsensical ban on the sale of military equipment to Israel, .Reversing the Liberal government's promise to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal, if he were to land on Canadian soil, based on the International Criminal Court's ridiculous charge he was starving civilians as a method of warfare, while aid trucks were pouring into Gaza and being captured by Hamas, .And defunding UNRWA, which the Liberals disingenuously pretended to pause, and whose schools are known to indoctrinate Palestinian children to murder Jews and whose members are becoming harder and harder to distinguish from Hamas itself. Poilievre also promised to make Canada safer, by performing the much-needed security screening our current government apparently doesn't deem necessary or finds boring. ""We will also screen incoming immigrants"" in an effort to ensure they ""have no terrorist links,"" he said on the call. He followed up with a promise to address what we've been seeing in our streets since October 7: ""there will be a crackdown on all terrorist networks that Trudeau has allowed on our streets."" To accomplish this, he told Winnipeg Jewish Review that laws will be passed and serious consequences will be doled out. Tackling radicalism in the streets will no doubt prove tricky to pull off. But this strong message, one we could never expect from our current mealy-mouthed leader, will no doubt be appreciated by those tired and frightened by chants for ""intifada"" in our streets. It will take a common sense leader with moral clarity to, without apologies, return Canada to its rightful status of nation and begin its redefinition. Because, if we as a nation fail to define ourselves, someone else will happily do it for us.

Jamie Sarkonak: Poilievre's very normal take on males in female prisons,2024.0,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't have to adopt the most extreme positions within the world of social justice and completely cede the cultural mainstream to his opposition. But he did, which is how we got a statement like this from Pierre Poilievre on Sunday: ""I can't believe I have to say this: but when I'm PM, there will be no male prisoners in female jails. Period."" He was responding to a recent horror story out of Quebec. One Mohamad Al Ballouz brutally killed his wife and two sons in 2022, and last week was sentenced to life in prison with no shot at parole for 25 years. Because he now identifies as ""Levana,"" Al Ballouz has asked to serve that sentence in a women's prison, the Joliette Institution for Women If the wish is granted, female inmates there will have to share space with a male counterpart who stabbed his wife 23 times. It would be an absurd and inhumane scenario - and it's only possible because of a 2017 policy change championed by Trudeau that requires prisoners to be sorted according to gender identity and not genitalia. Today, a fully intact criminal - rapists included - can be housed in the same facility as vulnerable women, balls and all. The first transfer, gang-related killer Fallon Aubee, formerly Jean-Paul, was moved into a women's facility in 2017 in a move that warmed hearts at CBC. It only continued from there. Trans-identifying bank robber Sam ""Steven"" Mehlenbacher was kept in a female prison and, according to another inmate, caused three women to require the morning-after pill; Mehlenbacher went on to receive a sexual assault charge, but it was eventually dismissed Most vile is perhaps the incarceration of baby rapist Tara Desousa (Adam Laboucan) and serial pedophile Madilyn Harks (Matthew Harks) in a female facility. In 2021, a women's advocate reported to the House of Commons that both individuals had been antagonizing a fellow inmate and her child in the facility's mother-child program. People like this have no place whatsoever in a women's prison. Unfortunately, the prime minister doesn't agree. Before 2017, all pre-op trans prisoners were kept in a prison dedicated to their sex; only post-op males had a pathway to female prisons. A key factor limiting transfers was the fact that pre-op transgender-identifying males weren't eligible for surgery unless they'd lived for a year as a woman prior to prison. It kept the barrier to entry for female prisons high, even though it wasn't perfect. But in 2016, riding the hype train of Netflix's trans-plotline-featuring Orange is the New Black, then-minister Ralph Goodale signalled that a more accommodating prison policy was on the way. In January 2017, he unveiled the new change: prisoners would now be eligible for cross-sex surgery if they lived as the opposite sex for one year, in prison or out. It wasn't enough, however: a few days later, Trudeau was confronted at a town hall by a transgender activist who accused the federal prison system of committing ""torture"" and decried the fact that women of ""any other type"" aren't put in men's prisons. Trudeau promised to look into the matter before uttering the magic words, ""trans rights are human rights."" A week later, federal prisons were ordered to evaluate transgender transfer requests on a case-by-case basis, eliminating the old standard that restricted transfers to post-op individuals. The prime minister accelerated, exposing female prisoners to violent male offenders all because of one self-interested activist at a town hall. The rest of the country, for the most part, isn't on board with any of this. Just under 80 per cent of Canadians believe that it's ""somewhat important"" or ""very important"" to segregate prisons by sex, according to 2023 polling by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. A little more than 70 per cent believed that trans prisoners should be kept away from female inmates. And because he agrees with them, Poilievre is smack-dab in the middle of normal culture: regardless of their partisan leanings, the overwhelming support for sex-segregated prisons shows that most people are Team Conservative on this one. For the sake of women in jail, thank goodness. It's a matter of common sense, really: men are bigger and stronger than women, therefore, they present the greatest threat. Plenty of Canadians want adults to be free to live as the opposite sex - but that does not include the freedom to leer at women in a federal institution. Trudeau, on the other hand, made his party into one that will ceaselessly defend Al Ballouz's right to be housed in a female prison after stabbing his poor wife to death.

"The Adrian Dix-Glen Clark reunion: New energy minister, B.C. Hydro board chair have a long history",2024.0,"VICTORIA - When Glen Clark retired two years ago as president of the Jim Pattison group, the former premier let it be known that he was ready, willing and able to help out the current NDP government. ""I would like to do something if I could that would be helpful on some issues,"" said Clark. ""Where I can be the most help, you know."" He further suggested that he would be a good choice to head up B.C. Housing. ""The premier's made a bunch of commitments on housing that I completely laud him for, so now they've got to execute,"" Clark told Andrew McLeod of the Tyee. Then again: ""They may feel my knowledge could be better used somewhere else, and I'd be interested in that, too, as long as it's something worthwhile that would allow me to make a difference."" There was also this testimonial from the namesake of the Jim Pattison group, where Clark worked and thrived for 22 years. ""Glen's a good worker, a hard worker, and he's got a lot of common sense. He's decisive. We like Glen a lot,"" the legendary billionaire told John Mackie of Postmedia. That is where matters stood as of early January 2023. But as the weeks gave way to months, there was no sign that the government had taken up Clark's offer. He wasn't interested in a functionary position, and apparently that was all the David Eby government had to offer. Clark continued to serve as Pattison's representative on the boards of Canfor and Western Terminals. He became a senior advisor to Rogers Communications and CEO of the Overstory Media Group. He also offered some unsolicited advice to the premier during a B.C. Business Summit in June of this year. The Eby government should shift its attention from ""wealth distribution"" to ""wealth creation,"" said Clark. By the time the election rolled around, it was easy to forget that Clark had ever offered his services or been rebuffed. Then came Friday's news that the government had found a job worthy of Clark's abilities. The former premier and Pattison executive was named chair of the board at B.C. Hydro ""Premier David Eby has tasked me with moving our province's clean-energy agenda forward,"" said Energy Minister Adrian Dix. ""That's why I am taking action to ensure that we have the knowledge, experience and skill set on B.C. Hydro's board of directors."" Three other directors were named as well, including Canfor president Don Kayne. But Clark was the key. There was no overlooking the deep connection between him and the energy minister. When Clark was premier in the 1990s, Dix served as his chief political adviser. The two also shared a condo near the legislature. Rare was the political issue on which Dix did not serve as Clark's eyes and ears. When Clark was accused of meddling in casino licensing on behalf of a friend, his denial was backstopped by a memo from Dix. It declared that the premier had ordered staff to ""insulate"" him from the licensing issue. Later, it came out that Dix had typed up the memo months after the order was supposedly given. Then he backdated it using the official stamp from the premier's office. Dix was fired. Clark resigned as premier not long afterward because he was facing a criminal investigation over the casino licence. He was acquitted on a charge of breach of trust, but was found to have twice violated the province's conflict of interest legislation. Clark was hired by Pattison while still embroiled in the criminal case. Over two decades, he climbed to the top of the Pattison Group, no small feat working for one of the most demanding bosses anywhere. Dix came back as well, winning election in Clark's old seat in 2005. He later won the party leadership, then lost the election, but bounced back to serve as health minister in the John Horgan and Eby governments. In the post-election shuffle, the premier named Dix energy minister with instructions to ""increase and expand electricity (generation) and low-carbon energy projects in B.C."" Eby says Hydro is moving too slowly: ""It takes eight to 10 years to fulfill a request from industry for the kind of electricity that they are looking for. We have to speed that up."" His government this month waived independent environmental reviews for nine new wind power projects, all the while insisting - trust them - that ""robust environmental permitting processes will remain in place."" The need is ""urgent,"" says Dix. That theme should sit well with the new board chair at Hydro. The retiring chair, Lori Wanamaker, is a career public servant. Clark is the furthest thing from a bureaucrat. As premier, Clark famously declared that ""process is for cheese."" He also branded Greenpeace and other critics of provincial forest policies as ""enemies of B.C."" Eby says all nine wind farms must be up and running by 2031. He also wants Hydro to pick up the pace with new calls for generation proposals every two years. If anyone can deliver on that timetable, it is probably the hard-driving combination of minister Dix and board chair Clark. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related Ex-NDP MLA Selina Robinson's memoir skewers David Eby, is dedicated to John Horgan B.C.'s public service 'freeze' comes after NDP added 1,600 jobs in six months",The Vancouver Sun (Online); Vancouver,Vancouver,"Dawson, Hugh",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 24, 2024",Energy,,2024-12-24,The Vancouver Sun
"Chow on Poilievre, Uber and tax hikes:   Mayor says she has proven she can 'work across the aisle' if new government takes over in Ottawa",2024.0,"The next federal election looms large on the horizon for Mayor Olivia Chow. She knows the man who polls predict may become the next prime minister from her own days working in Ottawa. But whether it's Pierre Poilievre or someone else who wins power in the nation's capital, Chow says, it would be unwise of any prime minister to ignore the residents of Canada's largest city. Chow shared her impressions of the politician who polls show has a strong chance of becoming Canada's next prime minister in a year-end interview with the Star. As she passed the midway point of the council term, Chow also defended decisions to not fight harder against Premier Doug Ford's plans to overhaul Ontario Place and remove bike lanes, and weighed in on the political uncertainty swirling around Ottawa that could jeopardize her administration's plans for housing, transit and anything else that relies on federal funding. The mayor said she got to know Poilievre more than a decade ago when they attended the same committee meetings on Parliament Hill - he as Stephen Harper's parliamentary secretary for transportation and she as transit critic for the NDP. Chow described the Conservative leader as ""very articulate"" and ""very ambitious,"" but said it's too early to predict how he would govern. However, ""if there is a new government, I have proven that I can work across the aisle,"" Chow stated, citing working relationships she forged with Tories like John Baird and Jason Kenny. The mayor has at times been at odds with the current government over issues like refugee funding, despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals representing almost every riding in the city. If Poilievre leads the Conservatives to victory in a federal election that could come before next fall, it remains to be seen whether his government would have such strong local representation, meaning the mayor could have less leverage. But ""as long as the wishes and the needs of Torontonians are expressed, no matter which level of government, whoever is in power, they cannot ignore the needs of the people,"" Chow said. With Trudeau's hold on power shaken by Chrystia Freeland's shock resignation and calls from his own party to step down, Chow acknowledged there's ""instability"" at the political level in Ottawa. But she said federal and municipal civil servants are still co-operating as normal on important files. Asked whether Liberal government promises such as the recently announced $758 million to help pay for a new fleet of Line 2 trains are in jeopardy if Trudeau's government falls, the mayor said: ""Hopefully not."" Chow was elected last June on a promise to ""open up city hall"" to communities who have felt shut out of decision-making. She had early success joining with refugee advocates and Black faith leaders to push for more federal funding for asylum seekers. But as 2024 drew to a close,those same advocates were back at city hall to demand Chow and council reverse a Dec. 18 decision to take no action on an ombudsman's report that found the city discriminated against asylum seekers by denying them access to the main shelter system. According to Chow, she still has a good relationship with refugee organizations, and remains committed to hearing from residents through outreach like public budget consultations. ""Those town halls were packed. North York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, downtown - every one of them,"" she said. The mayor wouldn't reveal whether what she has heard from residents will lead her to impose a lower property tax increase in next year's budget than 2024's historic 9.5 per cent, saying she didn't want to pre-empt the work of staff. ""No commitment at this point,"" she said. Chow's handling of the refugee report is among a string of issues over which the mayor has risked alienating her progressive supporters, some of whom have expressed disappointment that she has agreed to give the police an additional $46.2 million in 2025. Others are stung by her backing down on Ford's plan for a mega-spa at Ontario Place, or for not taking a stronger stand against Queen's Park's push to remove bike lanes. She insists she's not giving up those fights, and on bike lanes in particular she still hopes to find a compromise that would preserve cycle tracks on the western stretch of Bloor Street in Etobicoke while opening up additional car lanes. But the mayor explained her view that given the city's limited powers compared to the province, sometimes confrontations with the premier aren't the best way to get things done. ""There are things that you can't do no matter how much you try,"" she said. ""Then you find another path forward."" She cited her attempts to improve the wages of ride-share drivers. Her administration has tried twice to impose a cap on the number of drivers working for platforms like Uber, but after more than a year of trying, the most concrete outcome was a council-approved public relations campaign and pleas to the provincial government to enact better labour standards. While critics charge the saga has been a waste of city resources and shows Chow can't execute on her priorities, the mayor asserts that she's advanced the cause of precariously employed ride-hailing drivers by raising their plight at city hall. ""Now people realize, 'Oh my God, what? The Uber driver is only getting $6 an hour? There's something wrong,' "" Chow says. (Uber disputes that figure.) Chow maintains that she's focused on policies within her control that will better the lives of Toronto's most vulnerable, such as improving transit service, building more affordable housing, expanding student nutrition programs and keeping libraries open longer. ""Those are policies, those are changes, that people that have elected me expect,"" she said.

Caroline Mulroney: Ontario needs to become a global leader in artificial intelligence,2024.0,"In my role as president of Ontario's Treasury Board, I am often reminded of a line my father liked to repeat: ""Leadership is the capacity to look around the corner of history, just a little bit."" What lies around that corner today is the most significant technological revolution of our time: artificial intelligence, or AI. As a central agency of the provincial government, the Treasury Board's role can sometimes be underestimated. Yet along with my colleague Todd McCarthy, the minister of public and business service delivery and procurement, we are preparing Ontario for the AI revolution that is at our doorstep. Governments at all levels cannot afford to ignore the benefits of digital tools like AI for enhancing the public sector and improving outcomes for the communities we serve. Ontario has a generational opportunity to become a global leader in AI and now is the time to seize it. We are already leveraging AI in multiple ways to increase efficiency and improve services. At the Ministry of Finance, AI is being used to detect fraud, improve compliance and aid economic forecasting. In immigration, it streamlines visa processing. At the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, AI monitors air and water quality to predict ecological risks. In my former portfolio of transportation, AI stands to revolutionize Toronto's traffic management, making commutes smoother and reducing emissions. Our government is rapidly developing an AI strategy across the Ontario public service. By collaborating with world-class Ontario-based organizations like the Vector Institute and the University of Toronto, we are shaping an innovative and responsible AI future. Our approach focuses on high-value, low-risk and pragmatic use cases, investing where it matters and building enterprise capabilities with forward-thinking infrastructure. Through Ontario's Bill 194, the Strengthening Cyber Security and Building Trust in the Public Sector Act, our government is laying the foundation for Ontario's AI future by establishing AI governance within the broader public sector and ensuring data security and trust in digital tools. These efforts protect critical government services while supporting innovation. Over the past year, I have also been working to better understand how AI is already increasing productivity and improving the services that are relied on by people across the province. Some notable examples from Ontario's health-care sector stood out: Humber River Health has transformed patient care with an AI-equipped centralized command centre, adding additional capacity equivalent to 35 hospital beds, nearly eliminating medication errors and decreasing the amount of time patients have to wait for diagnostic imaging, as well as length of stays, admissions and more. Our government will be a maker of the future, not a taker, with innovation like AI at the core of improving people's lives and driving economic growth. To that end, Ontario's success in AI hinges on leveraging our unique strengths: infrastructure, energy and talent. We must provide advanced, secure facilities for AI development and ensure we have the energy resources to support this rapidly advancing sector. We are already home to the second-largest tech cluster in North America, with more than 420,000 workers at 25,000 firms. According to CBRE's 2024 Scoring Tech Talent Report, Toronto added more tech jobs between 2018 and 2023 than San Francisco's Bay Area. By prioritizing and supporting the right investments, we can build on this momentum. Part of our strategy is working, with global leaders like Unilever establishing the Horizon3 AI Lab in Toronto and Roche investing $130 million to expand its global informatics hub, backed by Invest Ontario. As increasing computing power and high-performance data centres are the foundation of AI development, Ontario must provide advanced, secure facilities capable of housing the sophisticated systems that drive and support AI innovation. That is why our government is future-proofing our plan to maintain our competitive edge. Energy resources are equally important, as high-performance data centres require substantial power to operate at scale. Our government's energy strategy is clear: The world needs more reliable and affordable energy to power AI and Ontario is ready to deliver it. Ontario's minister of energy, Stephen Lecce, recently announced that our government is leading the largest expansion of electricity generation in more than 30 years. By investing in enhanced power generation, we are positioning Ontario to meet the soaring demand for energy here at home, throughout Canada and across an increasingly digital world. With a solid governance framework, a comprehensive enterprise AI strategy and the right investments, we are on the cusp of achieving our objective of being the most AI-enabled government in Canada. Ontario's economic future is bright. By becoming a global leader in AI, we will signal to the world that we are the heart of innovation and advancement, which will improve the quality of life for the people we serve - every day.

Poilievre shows steadiness amid Trudeau turmoil; Trudeau Liberals in Chaos,2024.0,"The week in politics has been defined by a series of momentous events but Friday's lame duck cabinet appointment process was not one of them. It was a Potemkin shuffle, designed to hide a deeply rotten reality behind an impressive, business-as-usual facade. Aside from David Mc-Guinty, a long overdue addition as new public safety minister, this crop is not going to have time to make any impression. Of 153 Liberals, 30 were already in cabinet, 11 have said they are not running again and 40 to 50 are said to want the prime minister to take a long walk off a short pier. If you weed out the borderline idiots that sneak into every caucus, the prime minister was effectively left with no choice at all. Jagmeet Singh's statement that the Liberals don't deserve another chance and that the NDP will vote to bring down the government seems unequivocal, clear-cut and devoid of wiggle room. That means even if Justin Trudeau ends the parliamentary session in January, it merely prolongs the inevitable collapse of this government. He cannot prorogue indefinitely, and sooner rather than later, one of the opposition parties will table a vote of no-confidence that now looks set to spark an election. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has attempted to circumvent this process by writing to the Governor General, Mary Simon, claiming Trudeau has lost the confidence of the House and that she should use her authority to reconvene Parliament before the end of the year to test that theory in a vote. Stranger things have happened, even if it seems unlikely. But one way or another, Trudeau's goose is cooked. He has said he will ""reflect"" on criticism of his leadership. But the cabinet appointment process has likely made things worse, producing a bunch of ingrates, who got in but expected more, and dozens more malcontents, who got nothing. The only imponderables are, firstly, whether Trudeau will resign and use prorogation to hold a truncated leadership race; and, secondly, how much economic damage will be done to Canada in the meantime by an incoming Trump administration. David McGuinty's brother, former Ontario premier Dalton, used to say there is no wrong time to make the right decision. But it would be wrong for Trudeau to wait until late January to announce he is spending more time with his family. The country needs to be represented by someone Donald Trump doesn't mock openly. In his latest interview, the president-elect mused on how Trudeau's mother was ""beautiful and wild"" and that Justin is a communist like Fidel Castro, who may have been his father. Dominic LeBlanc would be the obvious choice to charm the Trump administration, were it not for the fact he's just been made finance minister, despite his own admission that he is not an ""economics expert."" No wonder 58 per cent of Canadians say they want an election as soon as possible. Nearly nine in 10 Canadians say it is time for a change in government, even though one third of voters say there isn't a good alternative. That is the only lifeline the Liberals have - that somehow in an election campaign when people are paying attention, they can persuade Canadians that Poilievre isn't worth the risk. That's why I think the most consequential event of the week, after Chrystia Freeland's resignation, was the Conservative leader's response. He has been criticized as being a caricature who offers simple slogans to complex problems. But the more at sea Trudeau has seemed, the more assured Poilievre has been. On Monday, he reached out to former Liberal voters, saying they supported the Trudeau government in good faith because they thought it was the right thing for the country but have been let down by the prime minister. ""What I'm calling for is, let's bring home the common sense consensus of Liberals who believe in liberty and Conservatives who believe in conserving it. Fiscal responsibility, compassion for our neighbours. These are shared common values that will bind up our nation's wounds and bring us back together,"" he said. It was eerily reminiscent of Trudeau's speech to the Liberal convention a decade ago in Montreal, when he appealed to disillusioned Conservative supporters. ""People in Ottawa talk about the Conservative base as if it is some angry mob to be feared. They're wrong. As you all know, the 5.8 million Canadians who voted Conservative are not your enemies. They're your neighbours,"" he said. The unseasoned Liberal leader then went on to patronize Stephen Harper as ""an idealistic reformer"" who had abandoned the principles he once held dear. ""We already know that Mr. Harper will throw any person under the bus who no longer serves his political purpose,"" he said. It was a promising start for Trudeau, who quickly became the most popular politician in Canada. But the idea he would be the great unifier drawing the country together faded quickly. Few figures in recent Canadian history have been more divisive than Justin Trudeau, who won successive elections by targeting left-of-centre voters in major metropolitan centres and vilifying much of the rest of the country. The events of the last week suggest Trudeau is the idealistic reformer who has abandoned his principles and who has no qualms about discarding people who no longer serve his political purposes.

Deragh Campbell:   CANADIAN ACTRESS OF THE YEAR,2024.0,"There is brave, and then there is Deragh Campbell brave. The most fearless performer of her generation, Campbell possesses a determined and unparalleled desire to claw under the skin of her characters, evaporating the line between fabrication and fact to a wisp of thin air. And 2024 proved to be her breakout year – if we can just get Canadian moviegoers to actually pay attention to what’s going on inside our own borders, that is. So here’s the top tip of the year that will make you feel better once Campbell breaks out even further: Keep your eyes out for two of this past fall’s big Canadian film-fest premieres: Kazik Radwanski’s romantic dramedy Matt and Mara, and Sofia Bohdanowicz’s Measures for a Funeral. Each film requires a wildly different tenor from its star – Radwanski needs Campbell to be wry and stirring as she cozies up to an old boyfriend, while Bohdanowicz forces her star into far more haunted and uncomfortable corners as an academic uncovering forgotten history. Yet the actress takes to both challenges – each directed by familiar collaborators whose filmographies have evolved in lockstep with Campbell’s – as if they were the most natural of journeys. Watching her figure out her place onscreen, not just in her 2024 films (which also included the underseen and unsettling drama Family Portrait from New York director Lucy Kerr), but over the course of her career, is akin to watching a cinematic high-wire act. Her work is a series of wonderfully constructed, audacious dares. Don’t dare turn away, or you’ll risk missing something astonishing.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Hertz, Barry",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 21, 2024",Motion pictures,,2024-12-21,The Globe and Mail
Province names former Premier Glen Clark to head B.C. Hydro board,2024.0,"The province has appointed Glen Clark, the now-retired Pattison Group executive and a former premier, to head B.C. Hydro's board of directors during a challenging period for the utility. Clark was named chair Friday to take over from Lori Wanamaker, a career civil servant whom Premier David Eby appointed less than a year ago and will leave the position Dec. 31, in a shakeup of Hydro's board that will see three other new directors join its ranks. In a news release, staff in the ministry of energy wrote that ""Clark brings extensive leadership, corporate relations and resource development experience,"" to the position at a time Hydro is under pressure to expand the province's power supplies to meet ambitious objectives of government's CleanBC plan. Clark retired from his high-profile job at the Pattison Group in 2022, 20 years after the firm's founder, Jim Pattison, surprised the political world by hiring the former premier. As premier, Clark used Hydro to implement some populist but controversial policies, such as a three-year freeze of rates starting 1996 which critics wrote off as vote-buying. Clark quit politics in 1999 after allegations were raised that he had accepted favours, renovations to his east Vancouver house and a new deck from a neighbour who happened to be involved in an application for a casino in North Burnaby. He was charged with breach of trust in the matter, but acquitted at the conclusion of a 2002 trial. Pattison hired Clark in 2001, starting him as head of the B.C. branch of his Jim Pattison Sign Group. Clark then rose through the ranks to become president and chief operating officer of the Jim Pattison Group for the last seven years of his corporate career. The province announced Clark's appointment on the same day it approved a proposed 104-megawatt solar farm in the southern Interior near Logan Lake, which will be added to the roster of nine wind energy projects intended to deliver enough electricity to power 500,000 homes. He is joined on the board by new appointees Merran Smith, a well-known environmentalist and founder of Clean Energy Canada, union leader Bryn Bourke, executive-director of B.C. Building Trades, and forestry executive Don Kayne, CEO of Canfor Corp. They will replace Irene Lanzinger, a former president of the B.C. Federation, resources expert Daryl Fields, both of whom are retiring, as well as financial consultant Victoria McMillan and financial executive Amanda Hobson whose terms are ending. depenner@postmedia.com x.com/derrickpenner With files from Canadian Press Related B.C.

"David Staples: Poilievre's knockout speech signals historic 2025 defeat for Liberals, whoever leads them",2024.0,"Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre gave a test drive in the House of Commons this week to his likely stump speech for the 2025 election. I'll suggest the speech did more than just hit the spot. It went viral online because it packed the punch of an Evan Bouchard slapshot, so devastating it brought to mind the question of just how low the popularity of the Liberals will sink in the final vote count. In Canada's 44 federal elections, the Liberals have won 24 of them, giving rise to its boast that it is ""Canada's natural governing party."" But not in 2025 it won't be, not with the dislike, if not contempt, many Canadians now hold for both party leader Justin Trudeau, who might be changed out, but also for the party's platform and process, which are impossible to quickly jettison. It was one thing for the moderate, centrist Liberal political party of Jean Chretien and Paul Martin to modify or even discard policies that came out of a compromise group consensus. It is another for the remaining members of the Trudeau Liberals to reject radical party views on race, trans, crime, drugs, immigration, climate change and homelessness. Such policies evolved into sacred cows under Trudeau. He made it his calling for such policies to be seen as not just politically expedient and on-the-whole beneficial, but as morally virtuous and as existential imperatives. It will take some doing for Liberal party members to throw off such a yoke, even as many of the rest of us are desperate for change, as Poilievre made clear in his speech. Poilievre said he regularly meets two kinds of people in his travels, first those who are little better off and who bluntly tell him if the Conservatives don't win, they'll leave Canada. He said he's not worried about group. Instead he's worried about the ones who are too poor to either move away or to make it here. He described meeting a restaurant waitress. ""She came up to me, grabbed me by the hand and said that I have to win. I thanked her and said that I appreciated her support. She said, no, it was not a compliment. Then she told me her story."" She had a full-time job and two part-time jobs to pay her bills, but she was in her late 50s and so very tired. She had cut all creature comforts out of her budget, which had allowed her to drop one part-time job, but then her car was stolen and her insurance company refused to cover its replacement value. She had to take back that second part-time job to get a new car. Polievre then referenced Liberal political machinations around the resignation of Trudeau's ally Chrystia Freeland. ""These silly games over here are very entertaining, as is the soap opera that everyone is seized with today. That is all fine, but there are real people whose lives are on the line. We have a duty to work for them. Quite frankly, this woman does not see me or any of us as any kind of saviour. They see us all as a last hope. In fact, she does not want to be saved; she just wants her life back. She was taking care of herself just fine before her tax, her heat and her grocery bill went through the roof and her car went missing. She was doing everything right."" Poilievre mentioned a Labatt brewery worker who worked three jobs to make enough to pay rent and care for his family. ""They can barely make it. He said to me that he feels ashamed when he talks to his kids because they ask why he is never around and why they can never have a house. He feels like a failure. He did not fail. He has been failed. He has been robbed of the promise of Canada. It was a very simple promise: If we worked hard, we got a good life ... ""Politicians break promises all the time, but do we know what was bad about this promise? This promise did not belong to the prime minister. It was not his promise to break. It belonged to all of us. Our purpose is to bring home that promise for that young man, that young father, and that older female worker, so that they can take back control of their lives once again."" The record low out of 44 federal elections for the Liberals was 11 per cent of the vote in 2011. With a new leader, maybe they'll be higher than that. With Trudeau, the bottom is the limit. dstaples@postmedia.com Related David Staples: The biggest loser out of Freeland crisis? Not Trudeau or Singh.

Don't expect a different Pierre Poilievre as PM,2024.0,"It’s as if he just can’t help it. Conservative Party of Canada Leader Pierre Poilievre, the man who would be prime minister, is this week closer than ever to having his political dreams come true. With the sudden and calculatedly injurious resignation of federal finance minister Chrystia Freeland from cabinet, the leadership — and, therefore, government — of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is hanging by the thinnest of threads. Poilievre continues to voice his oft-repeated assertion that Trudeau must go; that he has lost the confidence of Parliament, the Canadian people and indeed his own Liberal Party; and that it’s time to end this minority-government charade and let a federal election confirm what is widely believed: that this country’s next government will be a Poilievre-led Conservative majority. By any logical measure, he’s right. It might not have been completely true for all the many months he’s been saying it, but at this advanced stage of the Liberal Party implosion, it’s hard to argue that Trudeau’s time isn’t up. Poilievre also stated this week that the one person standing in the way of an almost-immediate federal election is NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party propped up the Trudeau government via its supply and confidence agreement and, since exiting the deal last September, opted not to support the Poilievre-induced non-confidence motions that might have brought the government down. Again, for all intents and purposes, an accurate assessment. But then, in calling for Singh to cease his indulgence of the minority government and join with the other opposition parties that have declared they’re prepared to support the non-confidence motion, Poilievre suggested — as he has numerous times — the reason Singh refuses to join Poilievre’s government-toppling crusade is that he’s intent on keeping the Liberal government alive until February, when he will become eligible to collect a cushy MP pension upon reaching the age of 65. There’s nothing to suggest such a notion is true. But Poilievre (who, by the way, became eligible in 2010 for a much-cushier version of that same MP pension) repeats it, because inflammatory rhetoric is a big part of what Poilievre has chosen to be as a politician: someone who’ll seemingly say just about anything for the sake of political advantage. Borrowing heavily from the confrontational playbook that has twice ushered Donald Trump into the White House, Canada’s prime-minister-in-waiting traffics regularly in misinformation — such as concocting wild theories that Trudeau is responsible for high grocery prices, or Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem was somehow the cause of global inflation — and resorts often to the sophomoric sort of name-calling (“Justinflation,” “Sellout Singh,” “Carbon Tax Carney”) that are a signature part of Trump’s style. It’s unnecessary, and it’s undignified. But it has become a favoured approach of right-of-centre parties in many countries in what has become known as the “post-truth” era, and it’s the style of politics Poilievre has embraced — clearly, with considerable success — in his rise to the top of the CPC. With the office of prime minister now completely within his reach, some speculate Poilievre as PM might set aside the superfluous bombast and adopt a more measured and statesmanlike approach. Those cockeyed optimists would be well advised to recall how many observers of U.S. politics predicted Trump would adopt a more refined and “presidential” posture once freed from the rough-and-tumble rigours of the campaign trail. It didn’t happen there, and it won’t happen here. Poilievre has spent the past couple of years showing Canadians exactly who he’ll be as their prime minister.

"Poilievre would be a 'catastrophe' for Quebec, Trudeau's lieutenant warns Legault",2024.0,"OTTAWA - Quebec Premier François Legault should think twice before asking for a change of government in Ottawa if he still wants money for his projects, warns Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Quebec lieutenant. ""We know that a Conservative government would be very damaging not only for Quebecers but for the government of Quebec,"" said Jean-Yves Duclos in an interview. Duclos accused federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre of being against several agreements and transfers favourable to Quebec in daycare, innovation, the Quebec tramway project and a transfer of $2 billion in housing. Poilievre has indeed promised to scrap the multi-billion dollar tramway project that has been making headlines in Quebec for years. He has also announced that he will tackle housing affordability by reducing the GST on home purchases under $1 million and that he will fund this project by cutting the Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund and the Housing Accelerator Fund He has not, however, promised to scrap the child-care program passed earlier this year, from which Quebec will receive a total of $6 billion over five years because it already has a provincial program. ""It would be a catastrophe for the Quebec government if a Pierre Poilievre government were elected,"" Duclos said. Duclos gave a year-end interview to the National Post before his colleague, Chrystia Freeland, resigned from cabinet on Monday, sparking a new crisis among the Liberals. During the interview, Duclos spoke about the Liberal meltdown in Quebec in 2024, but also about his relationship with the Quebec government. Despite the fact that Duclos was named Quebec's point person to the Quebec government on Sept. 19, Premier François Legault asked the PQ leader ""to have the courage today to ask his Bloc Québécois comrade to back down, not to support the Trudeau government"" in a confidence motion presented by the Conservative party. In Ottawa, the Liberals couldn't believe their ears. In 2021, Legault had made a similar request by inviting Quebecers to oust Trudeau's Liberals from power and to support Erin O'Toole's Conservatives. But Quebecers brushed that suggestion aside and went on to elect a majority of Liberal MPs and a handful of Conservatives. As Liberals hemorrhage support in Quebec, it's every MP for themselves Parti Québécois is forcing Quebec federalists to rally their troops Having just replaced his colleague, Pablo Rodriguez, who had resigned from cabinet to run for the leadership of the Quebec Liberal party, Duclos couldn't believe Legault was once again attacking his party. Today, he thinks Legault understands that it was a mistake. Because at the time, Poilievre hadn't yet said he was going to cancel the housing agreement. ""Eight thousand social housing units, what a disaster it would be for homelessness and housing in Quebec if the Quebec government lost this $2-billion agreement. He didn't know it in September, now he knows it,"" he said. As a Quebec City MP and minister of the public services and procurement department, Duclos regularly deals with his provincial counterparts in a relationship that has its ""ups and downs."" This year, there have been many downs. In Ottawa, many Liberals were tired of being Quebec's easy target. Especially when it came to the asylum seeker file, which was at the heart of Legault's outburst in September. As it turns out, a letter from Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Immigration Minister Mark Miller about the federal government's plan to address the problem has clarified the situation for Quebec. Things have been looking more positive lately, but Duclos admits that dealing with his home province's government isn't easy. Quebec is constantly at odds with Ottawa on many issues, including immigration. Under an agreement between the province and the federal government in 1991, the Quebec government manages the volume of entries of its future permanent residents and economic immigrants. The federal government must take care of welcoming refugees, family reunification and all issues related to citizenship. For years, the Legault government has been asking Ottawa for more powers. Earlier this year, Trudeau was clear: ""No, we are not going to give more powers (to Quebec) in terms of immigration."" ""Maybe we don't have everything we want with a Liberal government, but it would be much worse for the Quebec government to have a Pierre Poilievre government with everything we know now,"" said Duclos.

Poilievre in line for hefty pension,2024.0,"Re: ""The biggest loser in Freeland crisis is not Justin Trudeau,"" David Staples, Dec. 17 I am no fan of Jagmeet Singh and find his posturing to prop up the incompetent Trudeau government disturbing. What is also disturbing is the continuing lack of accuracy in the opinion pieces written by David Staples. In his latest diatribe about Chrystia Freeland, he states Singh is holding out to collect his $2.2-million pension. That figure is entirely inaccurate. If they retired at the end of this year, collected their pensions at 55, and lived to 90, a non-partisan actuarial firm calculated Trudeau would receive $4.4 million, Staples'golden boy Poilievre would take in $3.4 million and Singh would receive $910,000.

Poilievre to be left with Epic Mess,2024.0,"Whatever claim Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government had to fiscal probity was smashed to bits after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland resigned from cabinet in dramatic fashion, with a letter that cited the government's irresponsible spending. Freeland specifically mentioned the uncertainty and chaos that is likely to emerge when Donald Trump returns to the White House. The president-elect has pledged to slap tariffs on Canadian imports, and his administration is sure to upend economic predictability. While Freeland rightly left cabinet due to the disloyalty shown to her by Trudeau, it does not absolve her poor record as finance minister. Had Freeland actually delivered the fall economic statement (FES) to the House of Commons, she would have been forced to present a deficit just short of $62 billion. If and when the Conservatives form a majority government, they will be faced with the Herculean challenge of shoring up the budget, and this will be no easy task. Last year, the Liberals set a hard limit of $40 billion in deficit spending. This same government also set a target of reducing their polling gap with the Conservatives to five percentage points by the start of the summer. That gap would end up at about 20 points, so their inability to meet their budgetary commitments is thoroughly unsurprising. Tiff Macklem has earned himself a less-than-sterling reputation as the Bank of Canada's governor, but he correctly said in 2023 that massive government spending hampered the effort to clamp down on inflation. Freeland also ambitiously introduced a $100-billion stimulus package back in November 2020, before anyone knew the course of Canada's economic recovery. It exemplified the attitude shown by the Trudeau government when it comes to spending taxpayer money: big numbers, big words and dramatic announcements. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar is slipping below 70 cents U.S., eroding the purchasing power of middle-class Canadians. And if Trump follows through on his proposed 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods, it will have a devastating impact on the economy (following the U.S. election, Scotiabank economists estimated that a 10 per cent tariff would reduce Canada's GDP by up to 3.6 per cent). Even if the Liberals had adhered to their $40-billion deficit promise, there would still have only been a small fiscal buffer for unexpected shocks, such as the liabilities related to Indigenous legal settlements and falling tax revenues that were the primary contributors to the expanded deficit. On the latter front, steady growth from Canada's economic backbone of natural resources might have helped. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion contributes more quarterly national economic growth than the entire province of British Columbia. Unfortunately, a maze of regulations and uncertainty forced the federal government to step in and buy the pipeline outright after its initial investors pulled out in 2018. While this ensured the project got completed, taxpayers have been left with the bill, and it remains the only major oil and gas project to have been completed under the Trudeau government. Oil and gas make up the largest share of Canadian exports and sustains thousands of jobs, all of which generate tax revenue. Regarding other resources, the aquaculture sector on the B.C. coast is being shut down by the federal government on the basis of unsettled marine science, despite evidence to the contrary put forward by First Nations aquaculture operators. The estimated cost to taxpayers of shutting down the open-net fish farm industry could be as high as $9 billion, according to a recent report. When it comes to natural resources, the treasury has spent far more than it should, and gained far less than it might have - and this is true of other industries, as well. In their bid to entice electric vehicle manufacturers to Canada, the Trudeau government has sunk an estimated $43.6 billion into subsidizing EV battery manufacturers like Northvolt to set up or expand operations in Canada. Northvolt is now bankrupt, and demand for EVs is falling in Europe, Canada and the United States. Trump himself is promising to end EV subsidies, which would drastically reduce demand for the vehicles themselves. Furthermore, Trump has repeatedly demanded that members of the NATO alliance meet their defence spending obligation of two per cent of GDP. If Canada is racking up $62 billion worth of deficits, the money should at least be spent on meeting that target. Yet instead of investing in new military equipment and recruiting new soldiers, pilots and sailors, the Trudeau government has ballooned the number of bureaucrats in the public service by 43 per cent. From 2019 to 2023, hiring in the public sector was 3.6 times higher than the private sector. The public sector has become a massive welfare program to make up for the fact that the Liberals have failed to foster a vibrant private-sector economy, resulting in the recycling of wealth, rather than wealth creation, which Canada needs now more than ever. This historically unpopular Liberal government has had no foresight, caution or prudence when it comes to spending, only ambition, recklessness and inefficiency. For this much money, Canadians should expect far more than a plummeting standard of living, a peso-like dollar and an under-defended country.

Freeland's departure shows need for Election: Poilievre; 'Out of control',2024.0,"Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre demanded on Monday that the government call an immediate election as the Liberals were thrown into chaos by high-profile resignations, saying there is no time to waste with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration just over a month away. Poilievre said it's clear ""everything is out of control"" after finance minister and deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation from cabinet Monday morning, just hours before she was to deliver her fall fiscal update, which she had reportedly clashed with the Prime Minister's Office over. ""It would be ideal to have the election done before the president takes office (on Jan. 20) or within the first week or two of his mandate,"" Poilievre told reporters at a news conference on Parliament Hill. ""So that Canadians would have a strong prime minister, with brains and backbone... facing down President Trump and our American competitors."" Poilievre added he wasn't worried about springing a holiday election campaign on Canadians. ""Right now, Canadians'Christmas holidays are being interrupted by the NDP-Liberal hell they're living under,"" he said. ""And I think the best Christmas present we could give Canadians is to let them choose a new common-sense Conservative government that will bring home Canada's promise."" Freeland's resignation letter posted to X on Monday morning took aim at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, accusing him of trotting out ""costly political gimmicks"" before a potentially costly trade dispute with the U.S. ""We need to take that threat extremely seriously,"" the letter reads. ""That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war."" Trump said last month that he'd slap a 25 per cent tariff on both Canadian and Mexican imports unless the two countries cracked down on the flow of drugs and illegal migrants into the United States. He's since taken multiple shots at Trudeau on social media, recently calling him ""governor"" of ""the great state of Canada."" Poilievre said it is now up to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to end his party's support that has kept the minority Liberals in power for several years. Liberal backbencher Chad Collins, one of the 23 Liberal MPs who circulated a letter asking Trudeau to resign in October, publicly reiterated his resignation call on Monday afternoon. New Brunswick Liberal MP Wayne Long, one of a few others who has called for the prime minister's resignation, told reporters Monday it was ""time to go"" for Trudeau, adding that he saw a prorogation followed by a leadership race as the path forward.

"Justin Trudeau is the political issue, despite all the others:   The Liberals had hoped they could make Pierre Poilievre the issue, but they can’t distract people from what feels bigger: Mr. Trudeau",2024.0,"The polls tell us the top political issues in Canada are jobs and inflation. But the burning issue for many Canadians is Justin Trudeau. After Monday’s political bombshell, the new Finance Minister and still Public Safety Minister, Dominic LeBlanc, gamely soldiered on Tuesday by announcing a border-security plan with cabinet colleagues. But just about everyone around them in Ottawa was thinking about Mr. Trudeau. Will he resign? Will his own party force him out? Will he hang on? Those were the questions in late June, when a small group of MPs started to squawk after the Liberals lost a by-election in a stronghold riding, Toronto-St. Paul’s. The same questions were posed in October, when a group of 24 organized a kind of petition for Mr. Trudeau to go. They are being posed again, more pointedly, after Chrystia Freeland quit as finance minister Monday with a scorching resignation letter accusing the Prime Minister of placing political survival before country. It seems like there is more of a feeling now among Liberals that Mr. Trudeau might actually leave, mostly because of the Prime Minister’s tone in private and silence in public. And once again, Mr. Trudeau is promising to reflect. Usually, those kind of things are Ottawa bubble chatter, but Mr. Trudeau has been the main issue in the country, too, and for a while. Look at Monday’s by-election in Cloverdale-Langley City, where the Liberal vote collapsed so hard that Conservative candidate Tamara Jansen was elected with 66 per cent of the vote. For all their gains, the Conservatives didn’t get to that score because of their policies or Pierre Poilievre’s word play, even if they are more popular than the Liberals. It wasn’t because of Ms. Jansen, the former MP who lost the riding in the 2021 election. The only explanation for that kind of margin is that a large proportion of the people motivated enough to go to the polls wanted to register a verdict on Mr. Trudeau. One by-election is not a bellwether, but there have been three this year where the Liberals collapsed, including two Grit bastions. There were lots of issues in all of those races: prices, housing, immigration and so on. The Liberals had hoped they could make Mr. Poilievre the issue, but they can’t distract people from an issue that feels bigger: Mr. Trudeau. Of course, there are lots of real, substantive, big issues. There is U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s threat of devastating 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian goods. But now the issue is whether Mr. Trudeau has a government that can deal with it. Mr. Trudeau’s team had hoped that Mr. Trump’s election might somehow revive the Prime Minister’s political fortunes. After all, Mr. Trudeau led a Team Canada response that successfully wrestled down Mr. Trump’s demands for a renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement to a new deal with relatively modest concessions. The chaos that comes with Mr. Trump’s re-election might just shake Canadian politics enough to be a game-changer. Now it has, but in a way has made Mr. Trudeau the issue again. Ms. Freeland’s resignation letter accused him of putting “costly political gimmicks” ahead of preparing for the danger of Trump 2.0. The Prime Minister’s first-term NAFTA quarterback was accusing him of failing to do the right thing for the country because he was too busy working to save his own job. That is a powerful blow to Mr. Trudeau’s last hopes for political revival. It is one thing when voters doubt a leader’s competence, but far more damaging when they doubt a leader’s motives. Ms. Freeland has invited Canadians – notably Liberals – to do both. It was already clear that Mr. Trudeau couldn’t mount a unified Team Canada to face Mr. Trump this time. Now it seems unlikely he can keep hold of a cohesive government. For Mr. Trudeau, there isn’t another set of issues that might alter the picture of Canadian politics now.

Poilievre named Canadian Press newsmaker of year:   Conservative leader tops list for second consecutive year,2024.0,"For the second year in a row, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been chosen as the Canadian Press Newsmaker of the Year. Editors across the country placed Poilievre at the top of the list in 2024. He captured just over a quarter of the vote among a group of 10 candidates. ""The worm has turned on the current government and Poilievre has tapped into the zeitgeist,"" said Wendy Cox, the Globe and Mail's deputy national editor for B.C. ""Whether that means he'll be an effective prime minister appears to be beside the point."" Running miles ahead of his opponents in the polls throughout the year, Poilievre has cemented his position as Canada's prime minister-in-waiting. His fierce, carefully crafted sound bites aimed with precision at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the issues gripping Canadians have let him tap into the national mood at a time when Canadians are preoccupied with their finances and futures. Hounding the government on the cost of living and housing crisis, he owned the narrative in Ottawa by way of message simplicity, and put Trudeau's leadership of the Liberals on the ropes. ""Pierre Poilievre continues to frame the conversation in Ottawa, with Justin Trudeau switching policies trying to catch up,"" said Rob Roberts, editor-in-chief of the National Post. Poilievre also built up his party's election war chest, crushing its previous fundraising records. The party even poached a crown-jewel seat from Liberal fortress Toronto in the Toronto-St. Paul's byelection in June. The vote was called to replace former cabinet minister Carolyn Bennett, whom Trudeau awarded a plum diplomatic posting. The Tories under Poilievre's leadership have jammed up the House of Commons in a protracted procedural battle that effectively blocked the Liberal government from passing most of the remaining legislation on its agenda throughout the fall sitting. Seemingly every week, Poilievre found new ways to get under the government's skin in Parliament. In April, House Speaker Greg Fergus ejected Poilievre from the House for using unparliamentary language when he called Trudeau a ""wacko prime minister,"" then refused to take it back. He constantly dared the other opposition parties to topple the minority parliament and go to the polls in an election over the Trudeau government's capstone carbon-pricing policy. Poilievre spent much of his summer criss-crossing Canada in a campaign-style tour, taking his ""axe-the-tax"" message and rallies on the road. And while his multiple attempts to quickly bring down the government this year have failed, the man who honed his political skills as an attack dog in the government of prime minister Stephen Harper looks readier than ever for the next fight.

"Like her or loathe her, Caitlin Clark keeps the WNBA in the spotlight:   In modern media, the WNBA needs to be part of the conver sation and Clark brings the league the attention it needs",2024.0,"Though she bears no resemblance to him in style or content, Caitlin Clark has become the Donald Trump of sports. Everything she does or says makes someone angry. The people who are most reactive to her are her colleagues in the WNBA, all of whom stand to make more money because of her presence. Clark’s professional arrival could not be better timed in that regard. The league and players are currently negotiating a new collective agreement. Whatever additional monies flow from that – and there will be a waterfall of cash – should be referred to as the Clark Bump. But no good deed and all that. Clark’s latest misstep was trying to deflect some of the well-deserved credit that’s been sent her way. This past week, Time magazine made her its athlete of the year. That forced Clark to do the thing she likes least – a long, searching sit-down interview. In the feature that resulted, the issue of race was highlighted. For the most part, Clark has managed to avoid wandering into that minefield. In the piece, she is deferential to her Black predecessors, without being obsequious. “I want to say I’ve earned every single thing, but as a white person, there is privilege,” Clark said. It goes on like that with a lot of progressive boilerplate about appreciating and celebrating and highlighting. This sentiment is so middle-of-the-road that it is tracing the median. It’s hard to imagine a statement less likely to provoke. But it’s Clark, so the alarms were sounded. Everyone to their podcasts! Launch the tweets! Fire the columns! The comments getting the most play came from Washington Mystics owner Sheila Johnson. She is unhappy that Time singled Clark out. “We have so much talent out there that has been unrecognized,” Johnson told CNN. “And I don’t think we can pin it on one player.” Yes, we can. That’s why they call it Athlete of the Year, and not Everyone of the Year. Nearly 50 years ago, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television with her then husband. They turned a niche cable channel into a multibillion-dollar business. All to say, she is an experienced campaigner. Yet here she is sounding like she just discovered there is a thing called media, and doesn’t understand why it can’t be nice to everyone. Johnson’s comments prompted Clark’s defenders to pile in, amplifying a debate spun from nothing. The WNBA just did what their male counterparts wish they could do more often – turn a made-up story into a real one. It’s at this point that I call shenanigans. I no longer believe that everyone in the WNBA is irritated by Clark, who is about the most anodyne great star in sports history. If she was strutting around picking fights, maybe. But this kid? She wouldn’t say boo to a goose. This is the person who upsets you so much? Nuh-uh. I refuse to accept it. Instead, I think that everybody in the WNBA – Clark, Johnson and everyone else – has reached an instinctive and unspoken consensus on what sells. For 20 years, the WNBA tried to break through by highlighting the abilities of its players. That didn’t work. People laughed at them. Worse, they ignored them. Incremental gains were being made, but advancing by increments in sports is like moving backward in any other business. It’s either boom or bust. Then Clark showed up. Coming out of college, she was the biggest thing ever. She’s gotten bigger since. To say she should be more deferential to her predecessors is a bit like saying Michael Jordan should never have done an interview without thanking Jerry West. It’s a nice thought, but let’s get real. Unlike most other newbies, Clark came packaged with a ready-made rivalry against LSU standout Angel Reese. The two have history going back to college. Clark is white and Reese is Black. Everyone in the WNBA must have noticed that Clark vs. Reese got mainstream outlets talking about the league like nothing before ever had. So instead of doing what it had always done – accentuating good vibes – the league embraced conflict. That the conflict was mostly made up didn’t matter. Soon, people had taken sides. Some think Clark’s the greatest. Some think she’s surfing on the accomplishments of others. Despite zero evidence to support the thesis, some think she’s a racist. Some think she’s a scapegoat. The truth of it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you’re interested. That’s brand new, and is plainly intoxicating to those who’ve been involved in the league for years. It’s why they can’t stop saying silly things. The trick is stoking this conflict just enough that it neither becomes an uncontrollable blaze nor gutters out. So far, so good. If they stick with the playbook here, we know how this should go. Eventually, Clark earns the grudging respect of her peers. They come to understand that despite superficial differences, they are all more alike than not. Maybe after years of animosity, Clark and Reese end up as respectful acquaintances. Not friends, exactly. That comes later. But valued colleagues. Maybe they become the Statler and Waldorf of sports. Bicker theatrically, go through content-friendly tribulations and eventually play together. Maybe once it’s all over, they can do a documentary together. This show has been done before. They called it Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. That worked out pretty well for the two of them. It worked out even better for the NBA. The league’s modern brand is built on a white guy and a Black guy who strongly disliked each other until they were forced to talk. The players prospered and the league went stratospheric, but no one got more out of that racial conflict than the team owners. It took them from struggling multimillionaires to thriving billionaires.

Bell: Poilievre says Canada is in 'a very dangerous place' with Trudeau,2024.0,"Conservative party Leader Pierre Poilievre is not a man known to pull his punches. So when it comes to the latest obscenity from the theatre of the absurd also known as the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, why would he hold back? Especially now, when the country needs strong leadership and is left with Trudeau instead. On Friday, Poilievre says ""we're in a very dangerous place because of the kind of person running the country."" ""Justin Trudeau is weak, woke, wacko and wasteful. He has destroyed our economy, he's dividing our country, he is a threat to our future,"" says Poilievre. ""We have to get him out of office."" Trudeau is now seriously considering slapping a tax on Alberta oil going stateside in this tussle over tariffs with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Premier Danielle Smith has already said in this column if Trudeau steps in and tries to pull off that tax stunt Albertans would ""go bananas"" and ""it would get really ugly, really fast"" and would set off ""a national unity crisis"" at the absolute worst time. Smith adds a tax on Alberta is theft, stealing from the people of Alberta and it will not be tolerated. How bad can it get as Trudeau continues his slide into the political abyss? ""Don't rule out anything. There is no bottom with him,"" says Poilievre. ""This guy is a radical extremist. Most of all Justin Trudeau is a diagnosable narcissist. He will tear down the country. He'll destroy his own party, all to preserve and embolden his ego."" What does Poilievre think of throwing a special tax on Canadian oil going to the U.S.? ""It's just another insane, divisive, asinine, costly idea from Justin Trudeau. It's idiotic,"" says the Conservative leader. The tax hit would damage the country's biggest net export, a bigger net export to the U.S. than all other exports combined. It would drive down the Canadian dollar even further and drive up inflation and interest rates right across the country. ""This kind of economic vandalism would destroy our economy. In the end there are no winners, only losers."" For Poilievre, it would also divide the country when we need a united front against the tariff threat. U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on February 13, 2017, in Washington, D.C. Poilievre grew up in Calgary. He knows the story he tells too well and it involves Justin Trudeau's father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. ""Look, let's not forget when Pierre Elliott Trudeau brought in the National Energy Program. He caused a national recession, he caused people to lose their homes all across Canada. ""The suicide rate hit its highest in 1983, in the middle of the NEP when old man Trudeau was devastating our economy, just like his son is doing."" What happened to all the talk of Team Canada? Poilievre says Trudeau is already dividing the country, premiers are stepping up to do his job, protecting their borders, conducting their own diplomacy with the Americans. ""He doesn't want Team Canada, he wants Team Trudeau. That's the only team he's on."" The Conservative leader says Trump ""obviously has no respect for Justin Trudeau."" ""He's viewed by Americans as a total and complete joke. He's a laughingstock."" Poilievre says Albertans and all Canadians have to push for an election and let the people decide who should be leading the nation. He wants Canadians to call Liberal and NDP members of Parliament ""and urge them to vote non-confidence and bring down the Trudeau government."" The Conservatives are so far ahead of the Trudeau Liberals in the polls, you don't need a calculator to figure it out. Poilievre says if he was in charge he would sit down with Trump and a map of North America, realizing the incoming president wants his country to be safe and secure. He would ask Trump what he thinks is needed to secure our continent. He would work together with the Americans. Poilievre would also pitch to Trump the idea of ""one big powerful free-market North American economy"" with bigger paycheques and lower prices on both sides of the border and a rock-solid military and security apparatus that would stop any foreign threats to both Canadians and Americans. The Conservative ends on a hopeful note. ""I would tell my fellow Albertans, help is on the way. Canadians across the country agree with Alberta. I'll tell you Rick, Trudeau is despised in every corner of this country. ""He is trying to divide Canadians. He's increasingly uniting Canadians - against him. ""The future for Alberta is going to be extremely bright. We are going to unleash the energy sector in a way you've never seen."" rbell@postmedia.com",Calgary Herald (Online); Calgary,Calgary,"Bell, Rick",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 14, 2024",Leadership; Canadians; Prime ministers,,2024-12-14,Calgary Herald

And the insurance companies are bad guys too. Why don't we look at countries where private and public health care cohabit happily and often with involvement of insurance companies? Countries like France, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, to name a few, have far better health care than Canada and the U.S., and insurance companies play a role in the quality of the health care offered to citizens of those countries. The author of this article goes on to say that Canadians have access to health care ""regardless of wealth and social position."" How can we reconcile this statement with the fact that more than 21/2 million Canadians don't have a family doctor,wait times in our emergency rooms are measured in hours, if not days, when it should be measured in minutes, and sick people have to wait months for necessary tests and procedures?

Latest prohibitions put military, police in more danger Trudeau government adds hundreds more assault-style weapons to its gun ban, Dec. 6 Some Canadians, who believe only the military and police should have access to weapons, are pleased with this latest gesture toward civilian disarmament. There's a big disconnect with that though. As a firearms advocate and volunteer coach, I've talked to dozens of police over the years and a common challenge I hear is how today's recruits need more time and training just to get comfortable handling firearms. Learning to shoot isn't something you just pick up - it takes time and starting young, in a safe and controlled environment, is the ideal way. The Liberals love to say they support our police and military, but the reality is - their continued actions, over the past 35 years, just puts our troops and law enforcement into more danger.

Here's why, Dec. 8 Ricardo Tranjan suggests that parents should ask their children's teacher how she or he is coping with the stresses in the Ontario educational system right now.

Katy Austin, Midland, Ont. Poilievre must be hiding something Pierre Poilievre could receive and make public the names of Conservatives allegedly tied to foreign meddling, former top spy says, Dec. 9 Making decisions in the best interests of Canadians as a mature and professional adult, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau steps in and provides a solution for his rival's obstinance at his own political expense. Trudeau is a selfless, gracious and thoughtful man. He displays the characteristics of a leader often. But if a pig farts in Woodstock, it's Trudeau's fault to some. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre refuses to get his security clearance because he is playing childish games and is completely at ease with risking the safety of MPs and Canadians. He places his interests above those of the country. Why has refused to get this clearance? What does he have to hide? Why would anyone have confidence in him as a leader? I am not suggesting for anyone to necessarily vote red. However, I do think Canadians should thoughtfully consider ""anything but blue"" as a guiding light. Timothy Kwiatkowski, London, Ont. Sidewalk e-bike rider hit me and paid no penalty You make a lot of fuss about bikers who are hit, but what about pedestrians who are hit by bikes? The police don't even separate pedestrian casualties from bike casualties, and they never worry about whether a pedestrian has been injured by a cyclist on the sidewalk. This is a serious issue for me, because my hip was broken by an adult cyclist who was afraid of the road and so rode his e-bike on the sidewalk. He paid no penalty, but I spent a month and a half in (they called it a hospital) and I have still not recovered.

Poilievre's love affair with labour tested,2024.0,"Like teenage infatuation, it burned bright and fizzled quickly, with one party barely aware the love affair had begun. This week, the Conservatives appeared to mark the end of their outward courtship of organized labour. For a while, it seemed Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre was serious about standing up for workers' rights. He'd picked up the ball from former leader Erin O'Toole, reaching out to blue-collar workers, especially those in private-sector unions, hoping to mimic Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford's early success. In May, the Conservative party helped unanimously pass the Liberal government's anti-scab legislation, Bill C-58. ""Knock me over with a feather!"" Unifor National President Lana Payne said in expressing her surprise. Poilievre's office pledged to keep the measures - which kick in next year - if the Tories form government. This fall, in the lead up to a potentially disruptive Air Canada strike, Poilievre sided with the pilots, saying they were just looking for the same compensation as their American counterparts. ""We are not going to support pre-empting those negotiations,"" he told reporters. It was a clear reversal from his 2012 position, when he supported then-prime minister Stephen Harper's pre-emptive use of back-to-work legislation for those same pilots. In the summer, Poilievre declined to weigh in on the lockouts affecting employees of the National Railway Company (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (CPKC), even after Labour Minister Steve MacKinnon asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) to impose binding arbitration and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh attacked the Liberal government for caving to ""corporate greed."" Conservative MPs were told to keep their mouths shut. Then in September, Poilievre tried to distance himself from his anti-union record. In a statement sent to the National Post, he promised not to introduce legislation he'd supported while in Harper's cabinet. ""Hundreds of visits to workshops, factories, union halls and training centres have taught me a lot and helped me evolve my thinking,"" Poilievre is quoted telling the paper. ""A common sense Conservative government will not introduce or pass bills C-377, C-525 or right to work laws. Period. This commitment will be written in my election platform."" Those bills were sponsored by Conservative MPs and were an attack against organized labour. Bill C-377 placed onerous, overarching, expensive reporting requirements on unions, drowning them in red tape, forcing not just transparency disclosures on union leadership but on union suppliers, too. Bill C-525 made it more difficult for workers to unionize by replacing the card-check system with a secret-ballot vote. A move that sounds good, but studies show opens the door to more threats and intimidation from employers, and leads to declines in union membership. When the Liberals were elected in 2015, they repealed the laws - and Poilievre spoke against it in the Commons. The Liberals, the NDP, the Bloc Québécois, the Greens, and many labour groups never believed Poilievre's support for workers was anything more than an electoral ploy. They frequently suggested the Conservative leader wasn't as committed to workers' rights as he portrays himself to be. This week, Poilievre and his Conservative MP Blaine Calkins showed the skepticism is valid. It wasn't just that on Wednesday Poilievre called on the prime minister to end the mail strike by forcing Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to sit down and ""get a deal."" (The Liberals initially described the move as ""hostile"" to workers, but on Friday, MacKinnon declared the parties were at an impasse and asked the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order workers back to work until May 22, during which time a commission would be established to help resolve the labour dispute.) It wasn't just that Poilievre decried the large number of strikes this year, portraying worker action in a negative light. Despite the tension, Payne counts 98 disputes since August 2022, Unifor's president said she's tried to stress to ""every politician who wants to listen"" that strikes have ""a very positive impact overall in terms of progress for working people. ""These companies don't come to the table wanting to hand over things,"" she said. Workers took advantage of the moment before them - with high inflation and low unemployment, she said, and helped push the envelope on pensions, wages, and benefits. The next telling moment will be how Poilievre reacts to a quip by Calkins in the House of Commons. As MacKinnon slammed Poilievre on Monday for supporting C-525 and C-377, and erroneously accusing him of being the ""author"" of the most oppressive pieces of anti-labour legislation, Calkins piped up from his seat on the far south corner of the chamber to proudly claim ownership and defend the bill's content. ""That was my bill,"" he yelled at MacKinnon, about C-525. ""Wanting more democracy?"" he said, smiling. ""How draconian,"" he mocked. Far from distancing himself, here was a Poilievre shadow minister praising the controversial legislation. Calkins's thinking on labour, and those of the Conservative MPs laughing around him, doesn't appear to have ""evolved."" Poilievre takes great pains to muzzle his MPs. They are told to avoid commenting, ignore media requests, and rat on colleagues who speak to reporters. Whether he now responds to Calkins's outburst by remaining silent or disciplining him will be a strong indicator of whether the Conservative leader still has any love for organized labour, or if the honeymoon is truly over.

Tories will adopt military spending plan:   Poilievre's office says costs beyond those on the books would fall under 'dollar-for-dollar' cap,2024.0,"The opposition Conservatives say they will maintain defence budget increases planned under the current Liberal government if they take power, without making equivalent cuts under their proposed ""dollar-for-dollar"" spending cap. That means if the Conservatives win the next federal election, they would honour Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plans to increase annual military spending, with the Parliamentary Budget Officer projecting defence costs are set to rise from about $41 billion this year to almost $58 billion by 2029. But Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's office confirmed that any military spending on top of what is already planned for the Defence Department would be subject to the Tories' proposed spending cap - meaning military costs beyond those on the books at the time they take power would see equivalent cuts elsewhere in the federal government. That's according to a promise Poilievre first made during the Conservative leadership race in 2022, as he continues to pledge he will ""fix the budget"" if his party takes office after the coming federal election and inherits the Liberal government's legacy of budget deficits. ""Our common sense dollar-for-dollar law will require government to find one dollar of savings for every new dollar of spending. This policy will not apply to defence spending that is already on the books,"" Conservative MP and defence critic James Bezan said in an emailed statement to the Star. ""A Conservative government will not reduce the planned budget for National Defence."" David Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said the Conservative position is ""hugely significant"" for the future of Canada's military spending. In his view, it is a ""challenge"" to the current Liberal government to push ahead with a budgeted plan to hit the long-standing commitment through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to increase annual defence spending to at least two per cent of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP). As it stands, the federal government has budgeted money to get partway to that target in 2029, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to fully achieve it by 2032. ""If the current government doesn't translate their political commitment into funded reality, then I think we're still going to be in significant trouble with our defence commitments,"" said Perry. ""The flip side of it is ... if the Trudeau government puts the money where their mouth is, then there's bipartisan agreement on it."" In a statement Thursday, Defence Minister Bill Blair's spokesperson Andrew Green said the government welcomes ""the Conservatives' endorsement of our defence spending plan and their recognition that our government is on the right path."" Green's statement, however, accused the Conservatives of ""tough talk"" that isn't backed up by their voting record in Parliament, which has included voting against Liberal measures that include boosts to defence spending. ""We've doubled our defence spending since 2015 and are on track to triple it by the end of the decade,"" the statement said. ""We have a clear, achievable plan to reach the two per cent of GDP NATO target on defence spending by 2032."" The federal government has been under increasing pressure to chart a course to that two-per-cent threshold. NATO members pledged to hit that target in 2014, and have expressed greater urgency to build up their military capabilities after Russia - the alliance's adversary during the Cold War - invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Earlier this year, NATO published figures that showed Canada remains among a shrinking minority of member countries that still haven't hit the target, with defence spending the equivalent of 1.37 per cent of GDP. Even so, under the Liberals, the federal government has put billions more dollars towards the military. That includes a promised plan to ""modernize"" Canada's participation in the North American Aerospace Defence Command it shares with the United States, with $4.9 billion in spending earmarked by 2028 for improved surveillance and progress to install better radar stations. The government also released a new defence policy in April, which commits $8.1 billion over the next five years for defence infrastructure, sustaining naval vessels, purchasing ammunition, and more. Funding to at least begin the process of purchasing new equipment - from long-range missiles to tactical helicopters and early-warning aircraft - is also included by 2029. Several promises contained in the policy, including a pledge to buy new submarines that can operate under the Arctic sea ice, have not yet been funded. The promised funding comes as the Canadian military deals with stubborn personnel shortages and aging equipment. A recent report on the armed forces' capabilities in the Arctic warned of ""limited and deteriorating"" infrastructure in the Arctic. Canada's top soldier, Gen. Jennie Carignan, said this summer that the country must prepare for coming threats from the likes of Russia and China, while her predecessor Wayne Eyre spoke of being in an ""interwar"" period in which Canada must be ready for a major conflict. The Conservatives meanwhile, have not endorsed Trudeau's commitment to hit the two-per-cent of GDP target by 2032. Poilievre's office has previously confirmed the Tories would ""work towards"" that goal, without providing a timeline. Poilievre has also said a future Conservative government would scrap ""wasteful"" foreign aid and ""back-office bureaucracy"" and devote the funds to the military. In his statement to the Star, Bezan accused the Liberal government of having ""gutted"" the military. He said his party ""will cut wasteful foreign aid to dictators, terrorists and international bureaucracies and use that money to rebuild our proud military."" Bezan added that ""instead of feeding back-room bureaucracy, we will get the money to our troops where it is needed so they can do the important work of defending our country.""

Here's what some experts say is the biggest culprit and what the city can do about it, Dec. 9 I was so glad to see the Star finally draw attention to the way Toronto streets are constantly being reduced by at least one lane when construction begins on major buildings. But I was disappointed that the writers did not include the history of the construction of First Canadian Place, the Bank of Montreal building at the northwest corner of King and Bay streets in 1975. To limit interference with traffic on the surrounding streets, builders Olympia and York constructed a large turntable in what would eventually be the basement of the building, so that multiple trucks could go off the street and onto the site to deliver their loads, instead of occupying a lane on the street while waiting to unload. I'm not aware of this method having been used anywhere else. This example shows that it might not be unreasonable for other companies starting construction of major buildings in Toronto to be told they cannot close off any street lanes for deliveries, and that all deliveries would have to be made on-site. I appreciate that the need for installation of additional water and power delivery to new buildings would probably require some lane closures, but surely the current level of closures has reached unacceptable heights, and new delivery arrangements for construction materials could become mandatory. Philip Wedge, Toronto Tax snowbirds in response to Trump's threats Donald Trump threatens 25% tariff on Canadian products; Doug Ford, premiers call for urgent action, Nov. 26 There is a better way to respond to president-elect Donald Trump's tariff threat that will be much more painful to the U.S. economy: tax snowbirds. Every year, more than a million Canadians head south for up to six months. They are supporting the U.S. economy at the expense of the Canadian economy. They support the U.S. housing market, entertainment industry (restaurants, golf and tennis clubs, etc.) and spend on daily living expenses. If they get sick, they race home for free health care. Taxing senior citizens is not popular, but neither is seeing the cost of imported stuff go up by 25 per cent. Taxing Canadians who are away from the country for more than 30 days and want to keep their health care seems fair. Supporting Trump should come with consequences. Drastic times require drastic measures. Michael Yaffe, Toronto Trump should wine and dine our true ruler Trump calls Trudeau 'Governor' of the 'Great State of Canada,' Dec. 10 Donald Trump is wrong. Justin Trudeau is only the Prime Minister of this state. The true ruler of Canada, who is the representative of King Charles III, is Gov.-Gen. Mary Simon. She is commander-in-chief of the Canadian Armed Forces and exercises virtually all the powers of the Crown. She is the one Trump should have dinner with next time. Sylvio Le Blanc, Montreal Trump and Putin think alike Trump's comment about Canada becoming 51st state was a joke, minister who attended dinner says, Dec. 3 President-elect Donald Trump wants to absorb Canada and make it the 51st state. This is something that most Canadians would object to, but unfortunately our military would likely not be able to prevent it. This sounds like Russian President Vladimir Putin's attitude toward Ukraine. No wonder he and Trump are friends. They clearly think alike. Edward A. Collis, Burlington We need quality post-secondary education Where are the leaders of today? A cry commonly heard these days as people struggle, but the real cry should be: Where are the leaders of tomorrow? The lack of funding for colleges and universities is resulting in program cuts, denying educational opportunities. Freezing tuition costs, as Premier Doug Ford has done, simply reduces the number of places available. No one wants to raise tuition, but if this was done, it would at least provide spaces for those who can afford it; spaces currently being lost to funding cuts. In a country where we manufacture very little, our growth is relegated to financial services, innovation, technology and the service sector. Without high-quality and broadly available post-secondary education, that growth will be concentrated in the service sector alone, and we will all suffer for it in the future. To put it in terms the premier will understand, fewer people will be able to afford the new spa at Ontario Place. Peter Bradley, Mississauga Do we need Canada Post? It is time to rethink Canada Post. Most of us do our transactions/business online. Why not reduce deliveries to twice per week and add more corner boxes. Reduce staff drastically. As for packages, set up Purolator to compete with the big boys. We cannot continue with this inefficiency anymore. TomSteele, Peterborough Not a good look for a wannabe prime minister Pierre Poilievre says it shouldn't take Donald Trump to make the Liberals sort out a fentanyl crisis, Dec. 10 At a time when our federal government is dealing with Donald Trump and conflicts over trade and the border, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre does nothing but snipe and take cheap shots at Trudeau.

Poilievre slams PM on illegal drugs:   Tory leader says Trudeau government's border policies 'threaten our trade relationship' with U.S.,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre painted a portrait of Canada as a hellscape of fentanyl smuggling, distribution and destruction, saying it shouldn't take Donald Trump to prompt action from the Liberal government. In a formal speech to the House of Commons on Tuesday, Poilievre demanded the Trudeau government reinstate mandatory minimum jail terms for drug offences that the Liberals had eased following a Supreme Court of Canada declaration they were unconstitutional, among other demands to reverse drug policies. ""It's not because of another president that we should take these actions,"" Poilievre said, speaking of the motion he sponsored that ultimately failed to pass in a 210-121 vote, condemned by all other parties in the House of Commons. Poilievre's comments come at a time of tumult in Canada-U.S. relations. President-elect Trump has threatened 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican products sold to the U.S. if they don't ""stop"" cross-border illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, with an additional 10 per cent penalty threatened for Chinese imports. The Liberal government is scrambling to persuade Trump and his team that Canada is a critical economic trading partner with secure borders, and is not the same problem as Mexico or China are. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has failed to persuade Poilievre to join the federal government and many premiers in presenting a united front against Trump. Instead, Poilievre used an Opposition day motion to hammer Trudeau, saying reduced sentences ""for drug kingpins"" and ""lax borders"" contribute to Canadian fentanyl deaths and ""threaten our trade relationship with our biggest trading partner and greatest ally."" The Conservative leader cited, as he has before, a government statistic, but erroneously stated it shows more than 47,000 Canadians died of fentanyl overdoses. That number refers to all accidental opioid drug overdoses in the eight-year span between 2016 and March 2024. However, the numbers still paint a grim picture. Most of the deaths (81 per cent in the first part of 2024) involve fentanyl; and most are occurring in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. ""This is more than died fighting for Canada in the Second World War,"" Poilievre said. ""Never-before-seen homeless camps and drug dens overtake once beautiful communities where contorted bodies lie half-dead on filthy sidewalks in scenes resembling Third World squalor. ""Government tranquilizes our people with an unsafe supply of tax-funded narcotics from which those same troubled souls then graduate to even more dangerous drugs. Drugs like fentanyl, which are 100 times more potent than heroin, and now abound in our streets,"" Poilievre continued. Poilievre slammed, as he long has, the Liberal government's efforts at harm reduction, including safe injection and ""safe supply"" programs, saying that people are ""graduating from and using proceeds of these tax-funded opioids to fund the fentanyl trade."" ""It not only murders our people, but now threatens our livelihoods, as our American friends now demand swift action to secure the borders, to protect their people against the recklessness of this government,"" Poilievre told the Commons. He said the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 14 pounds of ""raw fentanyl"" at the northern border in 2022, a number that rose to 43 pounds in 2024. ""That, by the way, might not sound like a lot, but 43 pounds of fentanyl is enough to kill almost 10 million people,"" Poilievre said. Poilievre's motion demanded Ottawa completely ban the importation of fentanyl precursor chemicals. Canada currently strictly controls such chemicals for use by pharmacists, medical and research practitioners, and hospitals, and earlier this year, the Liberal government tightened regulations on a group of chemicals known as novel fentanyl precursors. Poilievre said, however, that ""80 per cent of chemicals used in fentanyl production are actually legal and unregulated in Canada. They can be procured here and imported from China."" He called on Ottawa to ""buy high-powered scanners; put more boots on the ground at our ports to stop fentanyl and its ingredients from coming into our country; and stop buying an unsafe supply of opioids."" MPs from all other parties - Liberal, NDP, Bloc Québécois and Green Party - argued the Conservative approach is unconstitutional, ineffective and would further damage efforts to reduce public health harms caused by opioid addictions. Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux, parliamentary secretary for the government House leader, said ""many would argue he (Poilievre) is nothing more than a puppet to Donald Trump,"" saying he ""exaggerates situations.""

"Vollmer and Clark-Kazak: On Human Rights Day, let's help global scholars who are under threat",2024.0,"Today, Dec. 10 is Human Rights Day, a moment when the world acknowledges the anniversary of the 1948 passage of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. On a planet in constant upheaval there is no shortage of areas where the fight for rights continues. But one important and often overlooked area is academic freedom. One organization working hard to help scientists, journalists and artists is Scholars At Risk Founded in 2000 and now located at New York University, SAR has grown to become a worldwide network of universities helping scholars flee persecution and escape dangerous conditions. The organization also monitors threats to academics around the world through its Academic Freedom Monitoring Project In the past 12 months alone, it documented more than 322 attacks on higher education, including 89 under the category ""Killings, Violence, Disappearances."" Canadian post-secondary institutions are part of the SAR network. Canada joined in 2012 thanks to the leadership of Lloyd Axworthy, then the chancellor at the University of Winnipeg. There are now more than 30 universities and colleges involved. Today, Carleton University has one of the most active programs in the country and has hosted 20 scholars over the past 10 years. ""We are proud to host these extraordinary and courageous members of our campus who serve as powerful advocates for intellectual freedom, human rights and dignity,"" said Carleton's provost, L. Pauline Rankin. This domestic network of schools is making a difference. But now is the time to consolidate and escalate the country's efforts to assist scholars at risk. It will take action and commitment by the government of Canada to help make it happen. We offer three important steps it could take. . First, the government should open a dedicated pathway of entry. A simplified portal devoted to these knowledge workers who are in danger would expedite their passage into Canada. Both France and Germany already have entrenched programs that address this need and both countries have accelerated visa and work permit systems. Canada should, too. . Second, the federal government should launch specific initiatives with national research agencies to offer safe havens for academics who are at risk around the world. When the war in Ukraine broke out in 2022, Canada was quick to respond with programs directed to help Ukrainian scholars. This type of assistance could be scaled up to offer help to those affected by conflict or persecution across the globe. When the special fund was implemented to assist Ukrainians, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Phillipe Champagne said he recognized ""the historic role that scientists and researchers have played in defending freedom from tyranny."" It is time to backstop that statement with wider support. . Finally, long-term sustainable funding for Scholars At Risk Canada would permit the organization to amplify its impact and lead coordination efforts. Currently, more than one-third of the country's 100 universities are members of SAR - from Memorial University in St. John's to the University of Victoria - and many in between. But it remains a loose network. It receives no financial support from government, instead relying on volunteers. Scholars are continuing to benefit. There are many success stories across the country because of the work of Scholars at Risk. Numerous academics fleeing the war in Ukraine received assistance from SAR organizations, including, for example, a linguistics professor at McMaster University in Hamilton. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers to education and, perhaps more importantly for our polarized world, states that education ""shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace."" Canada has a proud history of helping those fleeing unrest, violence and persecution. This is also a country that knows and celebrates the value of freedom. This is a moment when Canada can make a strong statement about protecting human rights and freedom of thought by increasing its support for scholars at risk. Norah Vollmer, is SAR Carleton co-chair and manager of Faculty Affairs, Carleton University. Christina Clark-Kazak is professor of Public and International Affairs, University of Ottawa.

Former foreign-affairs minister Lawrence Cannon testifies in Abdelrazik case:   Former Stephen Harper cabinet minister shed light on his thinking in 2009 on decision regarding travel documents for Montreal man alleging he was abandoned to torture and detention in Sudan,2024.0,"Former foreign-affairs minister Lawrence Cannon says he balanced advice to allow a Montreal man a document to enable his return home from Sudan with advice against the idea from Canada’s intelligence agency. In the end, Mr. Cannon said, the advice of an agent for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) won out, and he ruled against authorizing an emergency travel document for Abousfian Abdelrazik. In Federal Court on Tuesday, the former key cabinet minister for Stephen Harper shed some light on his thinking in 2009 at a key point of the story of Mr. Abdelrazik, who is suing Mr. Cannon and the federal government, alleging that he was abandoned to torture and detention in Sudan from 2003 to 2009. Mr. Abdelrazik said he was treated in this manner despite being a Canadian citizen. “I did get opinions in favour of bringing Mr. Abdelrazik back to Canada,” Mr. Cannon said in court. But he also noted he received opinions from a CSIS agent he did not name, who raised concerns about Mr. Abdelrazik’s travel and acquaintances, including Ahmed Ressam, who was convicted for plotting to bomb U.S. cities on the eve of 2000. Mr. Abdelrazik had become a Canadian citizen in 1995, but CSIS had been monitoring him in Montreal, operating under suspicions that he was linked to Islamic extremism and therefore posed a threat to Canada. “Basically, those were issues that were most prevalent to me,” Mr. Cannon said, referring to the CSIS concerns, and noting that he had a responsibility to think of Canada’s national security. “I did not want to put any Canadians in jeopardy, or have Mr. Abdelrazik come back to Canada and pose a threat to the security and livelihood of a number of Canadians,” Mr. Cannon said as Mr. Abdelrazik, 62, looked on from the spectators’ gallery in the downtown courtroom. As a result, the then-foreign minister used his power under a section of the Canadian Passport Order that allows a minister to refuse or revoke a passport over security issues. At the time, Mr. Abdelrazik was under a United Nations no-fly order over security concerns linked to allegations of an association with al-Qaeda. He was also on a U.S. no-fly list. Mr. Cannon was asked whether the concerns of the United States had any bearing on his actions in denying Mr. Abdelrazik an emergency passport. “Not at all,” he said. “Canada is a sovereign country. We exercise our sovereignty. This falls under the parameters of our sovereignty.” During Tuesday’s proceedings, an e-mail was shown in court indicating an official in Foreign Affairs had ignored the department’s advice on the issue, but the former minister said he welcomed varied opinions on issues and sought as much information on the situation as he could. Tuesday marked a return to the spotlight for Mr. Cannon, who was foreign-affairs minister between 2008 and 2011. He had also served as transport minister and as Quebec lieutenant for Mr. Harper’s Conservative government, and was later appointed ambassador to France. At the time of Mr. Cannon’s deliberations about Mr. Abdelrazik, the Montreal man had been living in the Canadian embassy in Khartoum – the Sudanese capital – for a year. A Canadian citizen since 1995, Mr. Abdelrazik had returned to his native Sudan in 2003 to see his ailing mother. There he was arrested by officials of the Sudanese security and intelligence agency, and, he says, beaten and tortured while in custody. Eventually, in June, 2009, a Federal Court judge ruled that the Harper government was violating Mr. Abdelrazik’s constitutional rights, and should fly him home immediately. Mr. Abdelrazik’s continuing lawsuit went to court in October after 15 years of delays. He is pursuing $27-million in damages.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Bailey, Ian",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 10, 2024",Diplomatic & consular services; Intelligence services; Sovereignty,,2024-12-10,The Globe and Mail
"A kaleidoscope of kitsch in a new vintage-inspired kitchen:   If the Ritz/Harper place were a recipe, it’d be an aspic full of questionable chunks of meat prepared by an unskilled 1950s housewife. But it’d still be cool",2024.0,"Walk along the streets of Toronto’s Dovercourt Village – Hallam Street, Delaware Avenue, Dovercourt Road or Gladstone Avenue – and you’ll see the usual bricks-and-mortar suspects: small bay-n-gables, vaguely Craftsman style semis, worker’s cottages and that ubiquitous 1960s/70s infill, the Toronto Special. It’s the same architectural story down Cassidy Ritz and Kevin Harper’s street. Some squat two-storeys, some three, all mostly gabled and semi-detached, there is a quiet, pleasant, predictable rhythm. And should one think that calm continues after opening one of those sturdy and staid Toronto front doors, one has obviously never been a guest of the former city planner and retired tattoo artist. There’s a drunken brass band slamming around in there, decor-wise. Which, for architect Wanda Ely, who often designs sober, angular and beautiful $3-million-dollar country homes, was an opportunity to have a great deal of fun. “If someone says, you know, ‘I just want my place to be nice for the four years we’re here and then we’re selling,’ it’s different than ‘Hey, this is my forever home and I’m interested in making it bespoke for me,’” says the award-winning architect. “And then when you find out they’re interesting people, you’ve got the recipe for something cool.” Recipe? If the Ritz/Harper place were a recipe, it’d be an aspic full of questionable chunks of meat prepared by an unskilled 1950s housewife. But it’d still be cool. And because Ms. Ely and project lead Desirae Ward understand that, like a scuba diver, regulation and control must be applied before plunging into this alien world, when a first-time guest opens the door, the front room remains relatively unchanged. Yes, there is eclectic mid-century modern furniture, but, these days, that’s pretty common. There is framed tattoo flash art as well, but with the foreknowledge of Mr. Harper’s profession, also copacetic. In the next room, however, the twinkling lights of a 1950s pinball machine are the lighthouse that warns the visitor that it’s time to be on his or her sea-legs. In this room, Ms. Ely has added bookshelves for the couple – and surprisingly they do contain mostly books – and created a portal into the new kitchen. And while one can spy long shelves groaning under the weight of all sorts of oddities and curiosities in there, one must first confront curio cabinets containing skulls and religious items in here first. And then, only then, is one prepared to enter the portal. While the couple’s old kitchen was only eight feet wide and a single storey, the new one is the width of the house and now sports a second-storey extension over top. And because the couple wanted to keep the old flooring, Ms. Ely brought the new kitchen flooring through the portal like a sort of wooden tongue. “Threshold-o-rama,” says Ms. Ely as we walk onto that tongue – thankfully not wet and squishy – and into the kitchen, where the first-timer’s jaw will undoubtably drop. And it’s not the carefully curated and contained Aladdin’s cave of taxidermy, old cameras, microscopes, baseballs gloves, Pez dispensers, tikis, flash art, bowling pins, wrestler masks and other tchotchkes that cause all the jaw-dropping, either. Impossibly, Ms. Ely has crafted a kitchen that not only competes with this kaleidoscope (or maybe collide-o-scope?) of kitsch, but compliment it as well. But first, those long shelves: “The idea of harnessing and containing, yeah,” says Ms. Ely. “When we looked at [the] inspiration images … I remember one had long, linear shelves and I thought, ‘okay we could maybe do a whole wall.’” As for the kitchen itself, the cabinets are a hybrid of sleek, teak, Mad Men -esque wood with burnt orange inserts for the uppers while, on the bottom, it’s powder blue, tanker desk-style cabinets capped with stainless-steel countertops. “It’s starting to get a patina of scratches and things,” Mr. Harper says of the countertop, who produces a large ball of compressed cigarette package foil that he says started his love of collecting when he was a boy. And speaking of collecting, ordinary things, such as baking pans and brooms, now have a place: “I remember you guys being excited about the kitcheny organization,” says Ms. Ely. “Kevin, you in particular, really lit up when we were talking about places to put your shopping bags and stuff like that.” A long, thin shelf ties kitchen backsplash to the new banquette by the window. Over the vintage German laminate table is a decommissioned City of Toronto “acorn” street light. And should one’s dinner be too dark, there’s a crank on its side: turn it, and your pork chops and apple sauce rise closer to the light source. For maximum legroom, the banquette is curved as it approaches the window. Up the original, narrow staircase, we inspect the original primary bedroom with its tiny closet and Ms. Ritz’s collection of inflatable terrarium footstools before heading to see the new bathroom, which borrowed space from what was the second bedroom. In here, sun-tunnels illuminate the surprisingly sober black-and-white tiles and fixtures. To add a touch of whimsy, the kitties get a circular entryway to their litter box, and a salvaged door reading “Recreation Room” gives privacy to the humans. The humans also get a double shower. “It is more work cleaning,” Ms. Ritz says with a laugh. Closet space has been gained, of course, and to keep consistency between old house and new addition, new baseboards were made to match the old in the new primary bedroom, which is lit by a massive window. Overall, it’s a massive change for this eclectic couple, functionally, aesthetically and structurally – a new party wall had to be built since in the old kitchen the drywall had been attached directly to the neighbouring house – and, best of all, it fits their lifestyle to a T. “I think I’m going to bake a pie this weekend,” Ms. Ritz says with a big smile.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Leblanc, Dave",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 10, 2024",Architecture; Flooring; Curators; Recipes,,2024-12-10,The Globe and Mail
"'Strict limits' on security disclosure rules:   But Poilievre could reveal details if intelligence agency gets court ruling, former top spy says",2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre could potentially receive the names of Conservatives allegedly tied to foreign meddling activities - and reveal that information to the public, a former head of Canada's spy agency says. ""The (Canadian Intelligence Security Service) can do what it wants or say what it wants, as long as it doesn't violate a federal statute or the Constitution,"" said Richard Fadden, who also served as national security adviser to both prime ministers Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau. ""You have to go to a federal judge and convince them that, taking all of the circumstances into account, this is a reasonable thing for the service to do,"" Fadden told the Star. He was referring to ""threat reduction measures,"" or TRMs, which are aimed at reducing threats to Canada's security instead of gathering more intelligence to investigate the threats. One of the ways that can be done is by disclosing certain information to external parties, who can act to minimize the threat. CSIS has confirmed that Poilievre is set to receive a briefing through that pathway, sharing in a statement that ""the disclosure of some information"" through a threat reduction measure has been deemed""appropriate."" Poilievre's office says the briefing is set to occur in ""the near future."" Unlike other federal party leaders, Poilievre has refused to obtain the security clearances necessary to directly receive classified intelligence, arguing that he will not be ""gagged"" by confidentiality rules that would bar him from sharing information with Canadians. He has instead spent months pushing to obtain briefings through a TRM, which would allow him to publicly disclose what he learned since he would not be sworn to secrecy. At his October appearance at a public inquiry probing foreign interference in Canadian affairs, Trudeau said there was ""no guarantee"" that a briefing delivered through a TRM would include identifying details such as names. He also said that Poilievre's chief of staff, Ian Todd - who has been cleared to receive classified briefings - cannot act on intelligence in the same way a party leader can. Neither CSIS nor Poilievre's office has shared what the leader is expected to be briefed on, nor the nature of the threats. But back at that same October appearance before the foreign interference commission, Trudeau dropped a bombshell: he said he was aware of the identities of ""parliamentarians, former parliamentarians and or candidates in the Conservative Party of Canada who are engaged, or at high risk of, or for whom there's clear intelligence, around foreign interference."" At the time, he said he had directed CSIS to ""encourage"" Poilievre to better ""protect"" his party. Two weeks later, Trudeau told the House of Commons that he had asked the country's security and intelligence agencies to ""figure out a way"" to share intel, and ""perhaps even some names,"" with the Conservative leader. Poilievre's office has previously stated that at no time has he, or Todd, been informed about any current or former Tories or candidates tied to interference activities. CSIS on Monday did not answer the Star's questions about what types of information Poilievre could receive, or whether he would definitively be able to share that information publicly. The agency did confirm to the Star, in response to queries about threat reduction measures in October, that there are ""strict limits"" on disclosing personal information about Canadians and those living in Canada, if ""additional authorizations"" are not obtained. Fadden said that while TRMs were ""probably not written into law by Parliament for situations like this,"" he is of the view that such a briefing would need to include identifying details. He said there are situations in which CSIS is able to ""override"" privacy laws if the agency obtains a warrant from a federal judge and if it is in Canada's interests for the information to be shared. But Ward Elcock, who served as CSIS director from 1994 to 2004, said he expects that the spy agency will be approaching its briefing with Poilievre with the assumption that he could make whatever is shared public.""I would assume that that will also cause them to brief him in a way which may not give him enough information to actually act on the information he gets, and it may not be sufficiently precise and sufficiently clear (enough to) allow him to actually take action,"" Elcock told the Star. ""If they are in fact giving him all the information that he would get in a classified briefing, then they have created a new precedent, which is a little startling,"" Elcock said. ""But I would assume that that actually is not the case."" Both Fadden and Elcock believe Poilievre should have received the same security screenings as other party leaders. As prime minister, Trudeau is not required to undergo the clearances. Fadden said that should Poilievre receive personal details in his briefing, and if he chooses to disclose them, he'll need to be cautious. ""They risk ruining a person's career and or life if they're not careful,"" Fadden said.

CSIS to brief Poilievre on national-security threats despite his lack of clearance,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s office says he will receive a briefing on national-security matters from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, though without being required to obtain special clearance that he has said would constrain his ability to publicly hold the government to account. The move follows a month after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Poilievre for refusing top-level security clearance, announced he would ask security services to find another way to brief his rival on foreign interference targeting the Conservatives. The Official Opposition Leader’s office said Saturday the briefing will take place this coming week. “We are interested in what CSIS has to say,” said Sebastian Skamski, director of media relations for Mr. Poilievre’s office, in a statement. He said the Privy Council Office (PCO), a central agency of the federal government, confirmed to the Conservative Leader’s office that the briefing would be offered under rules that allow CSIS to brief people regardless of that person’s security classification. “On Dec. 5, 2024, PCO confirmed our position,” Mr. Skamski said, adding the agency told the Conservatives in an e-mail that “the government is in a position to disclose the classified information pursuant to legislated authorities Threat Reduction Measures (TRM).” In October, the Prime Minister appeared before a public inquiry to answer questions about his record in fighting foreign interference. During testimony, Mr. Trudeau redirected the focus to the Official Opposition, and announced he had been given the names of past and present Conservative parliamentarians and candidates who are linked to foreign interference. He criticized Mr. Poilievre for not applying for clearance. Near the end of that month, Mr. Trudeau alleged that Mr. Poilievre’s refusal to obtain a security clearance was a dereliction of his duty. “The leader of the Opposition has failed at his responsibility to keep his own MPs safe from foreign interference,” Mr. Trudeau said on Oct. 30. “So, I have asked the security services to figure out a way to give some information to the Leader of the Opposition so that he can actually fulfill his responsibility of protecting Canadians, including those within his own caucus.” This spat between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Poilievre began in June after the release of a report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which said some parliamentarians are collaborating with foreign governments such as China and India to advance their own interests. NSICOP also said Beijing and New Delhi allegedly interfered in Conservative leadership races. Mr. Poilievre has refused to apply for the security clearance necessary to read the unredacted report. He said the obligations of this clearance would restrict his ability to discuss and hold the government to account on what he had learned. He has maintained since June that CSIS officials can brief him under the agency’s threat-reduction-measure mandate if federal officials feel there are foreign interference concerns about his party or caucus that should be brought to his attention. “Should the Government have relevant information, they are empowered by Section 12.1 of the CSIS Act to brief an individual using Threat Reduction Measures (TRM), regardless of security clearance status,” Mr. Skamski said Saturday. CSIS spokesperson Lindsay Sloane said the service has several mechanisms available through the CSIS Act to share information. “In typical circumstances, classified information is shared only with those who hold an appropriate security clearance and a relevant need to know,” she said in an e-mailed statement Saturday. “Under a threat reduction measure, certain information can be disclosed to reduce a threat. CSIS has considered the available mechanisms for sharing information with the Leader of the Official Opposition, as they related to the specific facts of this situation and the related national-security threats,” Ms. Sloane said. “In this instance, CSIS has determined that the disclosure of some information to the Leader of the Official Opposition through a threat reduction measure is appropriate. Plans for the briefing are now being finalized to ensure this information is conveyed to the Leader of the Official Opposition.” Stephanie Carvin, a former national-security analyst and a professor at Carleton University, said she’s concerned in this tussle between the Liberals and Conservatives that security is becoming politicized. “Canada has largely avoided the politicization of intelligence that we’ve seen in other democracies, such as our closest allies, U.S. and the U.K.,” she said. “At every opportunity, I feel like Parliament has shirked its responsibility to treat this seriously. It bothers me that political parties would use this as a chance to score points.” On Thursday, 2022 Conservative leadership contender Patrick Brown outlined interventions by India in testimony before MPs. Mr. Brown, the Mayor of Brampton, said an Indian consul-general meddled in his leadership bid, though he does not believe foreign interference by New Delhi influenced the outcome of the race that elected Mr. Poilievre. Mr. Brown, who was ultimately disqualified from that race after allegations he violated financing rules, told the parliamentary committee that his campaign cochair, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner, received an angry phone call from the consulgeneral to demand that he stop using the term of “Sikh nation.” Ms. Rempel Garner resigned from his campaign in mid-June that year, saying she was considering entering Alberta politics, and the concern over “Sikh nation” was later raised at a conference call with top campaign aides. “The concern that was raised was that I had used the term on a number of occasions, ‘Sikh nation,’ and the consul-general had expressed directly to MP Rempel Garner that this was something they obviously didn’t agree with; that it could be used in nationalistic terms toward the Sikh community,” Mr. Brown told the committee. “What was agreed upon was that I wouldn’t use the word ‘Sikh nation.’ ”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Chase, Steven",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 9, 2024",Conservatism; Committees; Leadership; Security services; Classified information; Prime ministers; Security clearances,,2024-12-09,The Globe and Mail
"Good time for snap election, poll finds:   Pollster says Ford's Tories hold commanding lead, but Trump and Poilievre could affect that",2024.0,"As Premier Doug Ford mulls gambling on an early election, a new poll suggests that might be a safe bet. The latest Abacus Data monthly tracking survey for the Star found Ford's Tories at 43 per cent - well ahead of Bonnie Crombie's Liberals at 25 per cent, Marit Stiles' New Democrats at 21 per cent and Mike Schreiner's Greens at six per cent. ""Now is as good a time as any to go (to voters). I don't see how their numbers get better,"" said Abacus president David Coletto. ""He's still by far the favourite to win the election,"" said Coletto, warning that federal circumstances beyond Ford's control could transform the electoral landscape. ""Tim Houston benefited from the fact that Justin Trudeau is still the Liberal leader,"" he said, referring to last week's landslide re-election victory by the Nova Scotia Tories, in which Trudeau's unpopularity hindered the provincial Grits there. ""Trudeau is pulling down Bonnie Crombie's numbers here. But what happens when - and I think it's a 'when' - the federal Liberals get defeated?"" Coletto said if, as every recent public-opinion poll suggests, Trudeau's minority Liberal government is toppled by Pierre Poilievre's federal Conservatives, the political dynamic at Queen's Park could change. ""Trudeau is the glue. But once he's gone, what happens? That's why Ford wants to go before Trudeau is gone."" Although a provincial election is not scheduled until June 2026, the premier and his campaign advisers have been ruminating over facing voters this spring, just after 15 million Ontarians receive $200 ""rebate"" cheques. Three senior Tory insiders, speaking confidentially in order to discuss internal deliberations, told the Star that Ford shrugged off Houston's massive win on Nov. 26. ""Ontario is not Nova Scotia,"" the premier told several people in the days after that election when aides insisted the PC success there portended good things for the Ontario party. Sources say Ford is preoccupied by the crisis triggered by U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods unless both countries tighten their borders. But that does not mean a snap election is necessarily on the backburner, they confide. Mindful of the uncertainty that looms once Trump takes office on Jan. 20, Ford's team is concerned Ontario could be plunged into a recession if tariffs spark a trade war with the U.S. Such economic upheaval could make re-election more challenging, they note. Abacus surveyed 1,500 Ontarians from Nov. 28 through Wednesday using online panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. While opt-in polls cannot be assigned a margin of error, for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have one of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. That means the poll was conducted in the wake of Trump's highly publicized tariff gambit. In terms of opinions on the party leaders, 37 per cent had a positive impression of Ford while 43 per cent had a negative view, with 18 per cent neutral and two per cent didn't know enough to say. That's a net impression rating for him of minus six per cent. Crombie was 25 per cent positive, 32 per cent negative, 29 per cent neutral and 13 per cent unsure, for a minus seven per cent net rating.

"A road map to a Canada that's taken seriously again; NATO, the North, pipeline atop O'Toole's issues list",2024.0,"Canada Serious Again,"" is the rallying cry 'Make of former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole. As far as slogans go, it may not be great. But for Canadians seeking a way through the current trade imbroglio with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, it is apt. Watching the sparks fly between Justin Trudeau and Pierre Poilievre - including the prime minister's accusations the leader of the official Opposition is un-Canadian for failing to join Team Canada's response to Trump's tariffs - I'm curious to understand what it was like for the Conservatives, and especially O'Toole, watching the Liberals negotiate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) the first time around. ""Any time I was somewhat critical of the strategy undertaken by Ms. Freeland and Justin Trudeau,"" O'Toole explains, ""I was told, 'You're Team Canada; you're being disloyal.'"" O'Toole was official Opposition critic for foreign affairs when the USMCA was negotiated (the Canadian negotiating team was led by Chrystia Freeland in her role as foreign affairs minister). And in July 2020, just prior to O'Toole's election as Conservative leader, USMCA came into effect. ""At one point,"" O'Toole laughs, ""I debated Catherine McKenna (former minister of environment) on their progressive agenda, and I called it 'virtue signalling.' Gerald Butts (Trudeau's principal secretary at the time) accused me of using an 'alt-right'word until I showed him he had used the term 'virtue-signalling'."" ""I'm a patriot,"" O'Toole reflects sombrely. ""I never liked people saying I'm not siding with my country. I want our country to win. I want us to be smart."" We both recall Freeland and Trudeau giving speeches, in Washington and New York, launching the Liberals'progressive agenda, knowing full well Trump had just withdrawn from the Paris climate agreements and ""was not renegotiating NAFTA to get more environment-oriented or Indigenous in the agreement, right?"" O'Toole adds. ""So they rolled the dice,"" O'Toole concludes, ""thinking that Canada wasn't America's main concern - it was China."" In the end, there was a bilateral agreement negotiated between the U.S. and Mexico that Canada was given the chance to opt into, O'Toole explains. ""People forget that,"" he says. O'Toole wasn't the only one frustrated by that experience. In his 2023 book, No Trade is Free, Robert Lighthizer (leader of the U.S. team negotiating USMCA) describes Canada-U.S. relations as being at the lowest ebb in our history. And O'Toole reports, ""Lighthizer says, 'We weren't serious.'"" Lighthizer likes Chrystia Freeland, O'Toole hastens to add, ""And she's very likable. I like her too. But she was not serious."" Trump has made it clear he wants American workers rebooted - and he's willing to impose hefty tariffs on trade partners to achieve that end. O'Toole takes this seriously, especially at a time when globalization has a weaker pulse. This 51-year-old former military officer now leads a global risk firm, ADIT North America, with offices in Montreal, Toronto and Mexico City, ""that does due diligence through human intelligence on the ground in 140 countries,"" he says. ""The advice I've been giving my clients for the last few months,"" O'Toole reports, ""is that Donald Trump was likely going to win the election and was likely going to return to a tariffed and a managed trade environment. And if Canada and the EU didn't come into line on EV policies on steel and aluminum emissions and trade issues, if we weren't aligned on security issues right from Huawei to the South China Sea and Taiwan, then increasingly, we were going to kind of be cajoled into line through the use of trade restrictions or tariffs."" I catch up to O'Toole, via Zoom, in the U.K., where he's working. As it happens, our conversation is scheduled for the very evening that Trudeau and a small entourage (Katie Telford, his chief of staff and Dominic Le-Blanc, Canada's minister of public safety) jet to Florida, to join Trump and his far larger delegation for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Could this be a spark - of what could be labelled ""seriousness"" - by our prime minister? ""The prime minister ... with his socks ... and Care Bear economics,"" used his brand to great effect in his earlier days, O'Toole concedes, and ""he beat me in 2021,"" he grins. But this is all catching up, O'Toole asserts. What's it going to take for Canada to be seen as credible and dependable, again, I ask. Applying Trump's metrics, it's the $100-billion-dollar question. O'Toole has a shopping list of issues ripe for more serious engagement with Trump's administration. And curiously, the topics that bubble up in that Trump-Trudeau tete-de-tete over dinner (border security, energy, trade and the Arctic) are remarkably similar to O'Toole's list. As a military veteran, it's no surprise that O'Toole would prioritize Canada's investment of two per cent of GDP into NATO, as fast as possible. ""How many debates in this country have we had about making our Paris targets?"" O'Toole posits. ""Well, there's been a target that been existing for decades that is much more tangible than Paris targets. It's the NATO two per cent."" And O'Toole wants us to focus on the North. ""'We the North'needs to be more than just the Toronto Raptors playoff slogan,"" O'Toole says. ""It needs to be who we are as a country, and to defend our sovereignty, we have to have a presence."" And he continues: ""We could make a strong impression by saying, 'We're gonna own the North, Canada's North. The Northwest Passage is Canadian and we're going to have presence there to make sure the world knows that.'"" For a couple of reasons, O'Toole's also recommending Canada offer to help finance the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline: ""One, there is political symbolism to it. ... It was cancelled by Obama under Trudeau. It was reversed by Trump, and then was cancelled by Biden on his first day in office."" And, secondly, O'Toole suggests, use this symbolic pipeline to kick-start a wider discussion about energy security in North America. While Canadians await Trudeau's next steps in Ottawa's plan for engagement with the Trump administration, it's useful to evaluate what's feasible in a managed trade environment where tariffs, sanctions, emissions standards, human rights - a whole range of issues - curtail ""free"" trade. Given what's at stake, O'Toole is hoping differing points of view on the plan aren't misconstrued, this time, as disloyalty or crass partisanship. ""I really tried to be Team Canada,"" O'Toole says. And I believe he's serious.

"For Poilievre, politics trumps unity on tariffs",2024.0,"Pierre Poilievre can see his Christmas present, an election victory, perfectly gift-wrapped sitting right there under the tree. After nine years of the Trudeau administration, which has struggled through complicated economic times and in delivering basic federal government services to Canadians, polls show a decisive Conservative election victory is there for the taking. But if Poilievre wants to ultimately open his gift, he shouldn't be trying to grab it too hastily or too greedily. He must start being more careful in showing that his preoccupation is first and foremost the best interests of Canadians and not his own electoral fortunes. His actions of the past week don't help that perception. Despite his poll numbers, many Canadians are having trouble warming to Poilievre himself. He appears snarky and sarcastic at times, rhyming off slogans and unduly focused on blaming Trudeau for everything, rather than offering tangible hope or solutions for the future. Highlighting government shortcomings succeeds in consolidating support between elections and from those who are staunch detractors of the incumbent. During a campaign, however, the light shines much more brightly on the main contenders. To maintain or expand his base, Poilievre will have to start acting more statesmanlike and try to temper his overt partisanship. In response to Donald Trump's boisterous threat last week about slapping 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports, which would devastate our economy, Trudeau was able to quickly score a face-to-face dinner with the incoming U.S. president to discuss the situation. In his reaction to Trudeau's meeting, Poilievre appeared somewhat shell-shocked. He went on - robotically, it seemed - that Trudeau had come back empty-handed and hadn't made any gains, adding that Trudeau is a weak prime minister who's lost control of our borders, immigration, crime and drugs, and of our economy. Trudeau's meeting with Trump was a first step. It could turn out to be a major victory if he somehow succeeds in having Trump back off. If he fails and the tariffs fully materialize, it could be the last nail in the coffin for Trudeau's leadership. Poilievre's comments, however, seemed politically selfish and potentially reckless. He could have risen above partisan politics, as part of Team Canada, like the premiers, by offering his support to the PM in hoping for him to succeed on behalf of all Canadians. Instead, his public comments trying to belittle the PM, who is negotiating on our behalf, compromise our position. It also places Poilievre himself in a lose-lose situation. Based on some of what we've heard from the meeting so far, it's already an uphill battle for Trudeau. His admission to Trump that the tariffs would cripple our economy prompted Trump's questionable comment about Canada ""ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion"" a year, joking (supposedly) that we should become the 51st state. If the PM fails, yes, it may benefit Poilievre's electoral fortunes, but to the severe detriment of the Canadian economy. And if Trudeau manages to succeed, Poilievre will reek of sour grapes compared to the impression he would have left had he taken a more statesmanlike stance in multilateral support of his PM, acting in Canadians'best interests against an external threat. Also this week, after months of the Conservatives having paralyzed the House of Commons with a filibuster related to their demand for documents about alleged misspending of a now-defunct green technology fund, they announced intentions to proceed with more non-confidence motions to try to topple the minority Liberal government. The last thing Canadians probably want now before the holidays is for the government to fall and to be thrown into a divisive election. If Poilievre isn't more careful, he may end up ultimately returning the gift that Trudeau so neatly wrapped for him.

CSIS to brief Conservative Leader Poilievre on national security threats despite his lack of clearance:   The move comes more than a month after Trudeau said he would ask security services to find another way to brief Poilievre on foreign interference targeting the Conservatives,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will receive a briefing on national security matters from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service  — without being required to obtain special clearance that he has said would constrain his ability to publicly hold the government to account, his office announced Saturday. The move comes more than a month after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Poilievre for refusing top-level security clearance, announced he would ask security services to find another way to brief his rival on foreign interference targeting the Conservatives. The Official Opposition Leader’s office said the briefing will take place this coming week. “We are interested in what CSIS has to say,” Sebastian Skamski, director of media relations for Mr. Poilievre’s office, said in a statement. He said the Privy Council Office (PCO), a central agency of the federal government, confirmed to the Opposition Leader’s Office that the briefing would be offered under rules that allow CSIS to brief people regardless of that person’s security classification. “On Dec. 5, 2024, PCO confirmed our position,” Mr. Skamski said, adding the agency told the Conservatives in an e-mail that “the government is in a position to disclose the classified information pursuant to legislated authorities (Threat Reduction Measures (TRM).” In October, the Prime Minister appeared before a public inquiry probing foreign interference and his government’s role in combatting it. During testimony where he answered questions about his record in fighting foreign interference, Mr. Trudeau redirected the focus to the Official Opposition. He announced he had been given the names of past and present Conservative parliamentarians and candidates who are linked to foreign interference. He criticized Mr. Poilievre for not applying for clearance. Near the end of October, Mr. Trudeau alleged Mr. Poilievre’s refusal to obtain a security clearance was a dereliction of his duty. “The leader of the Opposition has failed at his responsibility to keep his own MPs safe from foreign interference,” Mr. Trudeau said on Oct. 30. “So, I have asked the security services to figure out a way to give some information to the leader of the Opposition so that he can actually fulfill his responsibility of protecting Canadians, including those within his own caucus.” This spat between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Poilievre began in June after the release of a report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), which said some parliamentarians are collaborating with foreign governments such as China and India to advance their own interests. It also said Beijing and New Delhi allegedly interfered in Conservative leadership races. Mr. Poilievre has refused to apply for the security clearance necessary to read the unredacted report, saying the obligations of this clearance would restrict his ability to discuss and hold the government to account on what he had learned. He has maintained since June that CSIS officials can brief him under the agency’s threat-reduction-measure mandate if federal officials feel there are foreign interference concerns about his party or caucus that should be brought to his attention. “Should the Government have relevant information, they are empowered by Section 12.1 of the CSIS Act to brief an individual using Threat Reduction Measures (TRM), regardless of security clearance status,” Mr. Skamski said. Stephanie Carvin, a former national-security analyst and a professor at Carleton University, said she’s concerned in this tussle between the Liberals and Conservatives that security is becoming politicized. “Canada has largely avoided the politicization of intelligence that we’ve seen in other democracies, such as our closest allies, U.S. and the U.K.,” Prof. Carvin said. “A every opportunity, I feel like Parliament has shirked its responsibility to treat this seriously,” she said. “It bothers me that political parties would use this as a chance to score points.” On Thursday, a former Conservative leadership contender outlined interventions by India in testimony before MPs. Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown said India’s consul-general meddled in his 2022 Conservative leadership bid, but he does not believe foreign interference by New Delhi influenced the outcome of the race that elected Mr. Poilievre. Mr. Brown, who was ultimately disqualified from that race after allegations he violated financing rules, told a parliamentary committee Thursday that Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner received an angry phone call from the consul-general to demand that he stop using the term “Sikh nation.” Ms. Rempel Garner served as his 2022 campaign co-chair – until mid-June that year when she resigned, saying she was considering entering Alberta politics – and the concern over “Sikh nation” was later raised at a conference call with top campaign aides. “The concern that was raised was that I had used the term on a number of occasions, Sikh nation, and the consul-general had expressed directly to MP Rempel Garner that this was something they obviously didn’t agree with; that it could be used in nationalistic terms toward the Sikh community,” he said. “What was agreed upon was that I wouldn’t use the word Sikh nation.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Chase, Steven",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 7, 2024",Conservatism; Leadership; Security services; National security; Prime ministers; Security clearances,,2024-12-07,The Globe and Mail
"Trump's 51st state remark was no joke:   Donald Trump's comment to Justin Trudeau about Canada becoming ""51st state"" was a joke, minister who attended dinner says, Dec. 3 Poilievre slams Trudeau over meeting with Trump, Dec. 2 U.S. president-elect knows he has the power to devastate Canada's economy with a 25 per cent tariff",2024.0,"Donald Trump's comment to Justin Trudeau about Canada becoming ""51st state"" was a joke, minister who attended dinner says, Dec. 3 Donald Trump couldn't tell a joke if he had to. Joking about Canada becoming the 51st state? Anyone not recognizing this as a threat, or a promise, depending on your point of view, is naive. The man is about as subtle as a freight train at a prairie rural crossing at midnight. His comments about Canada becoming the 51st state have teeth because a 25 per cent tariff would absolutely devastate the Canadian economy. He knows it and he has the power to do it. And if the devastation does not happen quickly enough then why not simply ban trade altogether? Destroy the economy, wait for the country to fall apart and then simply walk over and take it? His ego would be fed by the success of this plan and he would be remembered - for better or for worse - as the president who brought Canada into the union. Peter Lehman, Waterloo Trump wanted to buy Greenland Although most of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's utterances are laughable, they should not be taken as jokes. Remember, this is the guy who wanted to buy Greenland and had a big snit when the Greenlandic and Danish leaders said ""No, thank you."" Canada would just be a bigger real estate deal for Mr. Trump. Patrick Stewart, Toronto Bending the knee before a bully never works Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has guaranteed his loss in the next election and embarrassed the country by appearing as a supplicant before Donald Trump. What was he thinking? Bending the knee before a bully never works. Trump has suggested that maybe we should be the 51st state if we don't like tariffs. That was probably his aim all along. Trudeau should quickly grow a spine. Stephen Landers, Stratford, Ont. It's unwise to take Trump's quips lightly Donald Trump does not ""joke."" The Grinch has a better sense of humour. And at least the green guy has a heart, although a small one. The orange one doesn't seem to have one at all. I hope our Canadian politicians hearing that seemingly innocuous quip at the dinner table take what Trump says very seriously. When I read about what The Donald so casually threw out at the dinner table, my blood ran cold. Don't for a second believe he doesn't mean it. It has been his country's intention to overtake Canada since they couldn't do it in 1812. They don't like to lose. Bonnie Beaudry, Burlington Poilievre doesn't understand looming threat Poilievre slams Trudeau over meeting with Trump, Dec. 2 Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre either fails to understand Donald Trump's modus operandi or pretends to not understand the man. Men like Trump often are obsessed with their appearance, are drawn to macho types, mistreat others they deem weaker, like women or their employees or tenants, and have a bleak outlook overall. They feel permanently aggrieved and can never feel rich enough or powerful enough. Their philosophy is that others are out to screw them, and the only way to survive is to screw others first. They love making threats, though they will sometimes magnanimously temper or even rescind those threats, again, replaying their own experience of having been traumatized. Other men who were traumatized gravitate to such a leader.

Trump tests Poilievre’s political playbook:   The uncertainty created by the president-elect leaves the Conservative Party Leader finding he’s no longer in control of the narrative,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s political focus is being tested by the uncertainty that Donald Trump injects into Canadian and international politics. After two years of Mr. Poilievre pushing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over housing and other affordability issues – and with the Conservatives well ahead in the polls – the U.S. presidentelect is changing the stakes, said Ginny Roth, who ran Mr. Poilievre’s communications during his 2022 leadership bid and is a partner at Crestview Strategy. “I don’t think Trump is a variable that you can wrest control of,” she said. That leaves Mr. Poilievre facing a new political reality: He’s no longer in control of the narrative. The polls have created an unrealistic expectation for Mr. Poilievre to act as though he is in charge, said Regan Watts, who worked as an adviser to former Conservative foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon. “Just because he’s leading in the polls doesn’t make him the prime minister,” Mr. Watts said. “It doesn’t give him all of the obligations of being the prime minister.” The responsibility of managing the Canada-U.S. relationship belongs to the current elected government, Mr. Watts said, not Mr. Poilievre, even as Mr. Trudeau and other political and business leaders urge a Team Canada approach to the issue. Nonetheless, the past two weeks have showcased Mr. Poilievre trying to figure out the new Trump dynamic and what it means for his political future. Mr. Poilievre and his MPs rarely comment in the national media on issues beyond their core agenda, but when Mr. Trump dropped his 25-per-cent tariff threat, which would be devastating to the Canadian economy, it couldn’t be ignored. So he held the first of a series of news conferences with the parliamentary press corps, all T responding to the reverberations t from Mr. Trump’s threat as it d continued to dominated the i news cycle. Not responding to Mr. Trump M wasn’t an option, and Mr. Poi- f lievre likely also saw it as an im- J portant opportunity to frame the h coming debate on Canada-U.S. O relations his way, Ms. Roth said. m “He never wants to take for granted [that] the public will c blame Trudeau for what [Mr. Poi- t lievre] thinks he should be blamed for,” she said. Mr. Poilievre has said that he a believes the tariffs would be un- t justified. But, he also blames Mr. a Trudeau for loose border and im- m migration controls. Mr. Trudeau a has in turn suggested that ampli- c fies American misinformation. The run of engagements with a the national media were heavily t scrutinized. Some political pun- t dits assessed Mr. Poilievre as t appearing unsettled. But Mr.Watts said what he saw over the course of two weeks was a Con- a servative Leader figuring out l when to use a baseball bat to u smash at the government and when to use a scalpel for a more h precise response – a sign of ma- L turity, Mr. Watts said, and a readiness to lead. Abacus Data chief executive T officer David Coletto said few m Canadians thus far name Cana- n da-U.S. relations as a top priority. That, plus Mr. Poilievre’s com- c manding lead in the polls, mean h his response to Mr. Trump, at T least for now, likely won’t shift e public opinion. t A policy on Canada-U.S. rela- l tions if Mr. Poilievre becomes t prime minister is in the works as m he consults with people who have deep ties in U.S. politics. This past week, a coterie of Canadian Conservatives attend- s ed the International Democracy Union convention in Washington. The IDU, an alliance of cen- o tre-right political parties, is cur- w rently led by former prime minis- t ter Stephen Harper, who presi- t ded over a conference full of t Republicans – including Mr. a Trump’s current choice for national-security adviser – for three days. Mr. Poilievre was a minister in the Harper government. Then, there is Conservative MP Jamil Jivani who is close friends with vice-president-elect JD Vance, going for lunch with him in Washington on Nov. 13. On Friday, Mr. Vance used social media to amplify Mr. Jivani’s thoughts on what the MP has called the persecution of Christians in Canada. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland didn’t answer when asked this week whether she’s tried to speak to Mr. Jivani for any insight on how the government should approach the U.S. administration, despite Ottawa’s calls for a Team Canada approach to managing Mr. Trump. During a meeting with opposition leaders on Canada-U.S. affairs this week, Mr. Trudeau also did not explicitly ask Mr. Poilievre, or any other party chiefs, whether they had any personal contacts in the U.S. that they’d be willing to call upon to press Canada’s case. Upon leaving the meeting, Mr. Poilievre did say he’d be willing to carry the message of the damage tariffs could do to both countries to anyone with influence in the U.S., though he didn’t answer the question of how he’d do that or with whom. While Mr. Trump’s volatility is a challenge, Mr. Poilievre has long been a student of the populist currents that swept Mr. Trump into office, making it perhaps easier for the Conservative Leader to anticipate what might be coming, Ms. Roth said. “He has more empathy for the Trump voting coalition and more ability to understand Donald Trump than most,” she said. On the other hand, there could be risks for Mr. Poilievre if he is seen as too close to Mr. Trump – or of having the tacit endorsement of his administration, Mr. Coletto said. Mr. Poilievre has knit together a coalition of voters who aren’t in alignment on Mr. Trump. “A sizable portion of his base likes Trump but a sizable portion of his base doesn’t,” Mr. Coletto said. For now, Mr. Poilievre may be on the cusp of regaining control of the narrative. This coming week on Parliament Hill, his party is in charge of the agenda for two days, and on both he intends to call for the defeat of the Liberal government.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Levitz, Stephanie",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 7, 2024",Conservatism; Political leadership; Prime ministers; Tariffs,,2024-12-07,The Globe and Mail
"Poilievre fumbles the Trump crisis:   In the wake of the U.S. tariff threat, the Conservative Leader has looked jittery, uncertain and off-key. He has at times seemed to take Mr. Trump’s side in the controversy",2024.0,"That was quite the meeting at Mar-a-Lago. As our Steven Chase reports, they started in the Library Bar, beneath the portrait of a much younger Donald Trump “in a white V-neck sweater and white pants.” The Prime Minister met first with Judge Jeanine Pirro, of Fox News fame, before the president-elect joined them. The meeting itself was held over dinner on the patio, among the club members and their guests. Mr. Trump amused himself by selecting songs from his iPad to play through the patio speakers – “two versions of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah, a song from the musical Cats, as well as work by Luciano Pavarotti” – stopping the conversation at various stages to point out a highlight. So just your regular working meeting between two world leaders. It was the Prime Minister who had first suggested the meeting in an election-night call. It had taken the following three weeks to nail it down. The days leading up to it had been filled with intense preparation. Once in the meeting, the Prime Minister and his officials made a determined effort to impress upon Mr. Trump that the Canadian border was not the porous menace he believed, but also advising him of the measures they were putting in place to secure it: drones, helicopters, personnel, the works. And what did they receive in return? Bupkis. No assurance of any kind with regard to the 25per-cent tariff Mr. Trump has been threatening, since that supper-hour social-media post, to impose. No indication of what measures, if any, would induce him to change his mind. Just a volley of complaints about how Canada was “ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100-billion” by which he apparently meant the U.S. trade deficit with Canada (it’s nowhere near that large but never mind). Oh, and a little “joke,” which the Trump team carefully leaked to friendly media, about Canada being annexed as the 51st state, with the Prime Minister allowed to remain as its governor. Ha ha ha. A few things should be clear from this exchange, if they were not before. It never was about the border. Nothing we do about the border – not that there is much that can be done – is likely to avert the tariff that is coming our way. Mr. Trump cooked up the border “crisis” solely to provide himself with a legal and political pretext to do, on national security grounds, what he was going to do anyway. He is going to do it because he believes in tariffs – because he sees trade, as he sees life, solely in terms of winners and losers; because he understands a trade deficit, not as, essentially, an accounting identity, the flip side of a capital surplus, but as an indication that one country is winning and another is losing; because, most of all, every economist regards tariffs as an abomination, and because the closest thing Mr. Trump has to a code is always to do the opposite of whatever expert opinion recommends. So we can turn ourselves inside out on the border to please him. Mr. Trump may even seem to entertain our efforts for a time. This will produce in him another frisson, when at length he decides to impose them anyway: not only for the pleasure the tariffs themselves will bring, but the pleasure of crushing and humiliating Justin Trudeau. Even so, it is hard to fault the Prime Minister for trying. It is easy to say that the effort was doomed, even foolish; that Mr. Trump does not operate by any of the normal rules – of human behaviour, let alone international diplomacy; that efforts to appease him only offer him an opportunity to do what he likes best, to dominate. But to many people the Prime Minister will nevertheless have looked practical, reasonable, adult, in all, prime ministerial. It is not a given that Mr. Trump’s bullying will be to Mr. Trudeau’s disadvantage, politically. Mr. Trump’s unreasonableness is well known. If Mr. Trudeau is seen to have gone the extra mile, or 1,300, to deal with him; if he then is forced to take retaliatory measures, painful as they may be, the public may conclude that he has made the best of a bad hand. They may even conclude that Canada is likely to suffer less from Mr. Trump’s depredations under Mr. Trudeau, given his experience in dealing with Mr. Trump, than they would under another leader. I am not saying they would be right to draw this conclusion. Neither am I saying they necessarily will. But it is not a possibility one can rule out. Where does this leave Mr. Trudeau’s primary domestic antagonist, Pierre Poilievre? In the wake of the Trump tariff threat the Conservative Leader has looked jittery, uncertain, off-key. I think he senses the political danger. He knows, I think, that if there is one issue that can let Mr. Trudeau up off the mat, however implausible it may seem at the moment, it is this. If Mr. Trudeau’s appearance with Mr. Trump struck you as cringeworthy, try to imagine how Mr. Poilievre would look next to him. Would he look like – behave like – a prime minister? Would he conduct himself with the dignity and the self-confidence that the job requires, knowing when to speak up and when to stay silent, when to show his hand and when to keep his cards in reserve? Or would he look boyish, callow, too eager to impress; talk too much, give away too much, signal insecurity throughout? It’s difficult to say, of course. All one can do – all the public can do – is draw inferences from what we already know of Mr. Poilievre’s character and judgment, extrapolating from his comportment to date to predict how he will behave in future. And what we have seen of him to date has been, not a future prime minister, but a perpetual opposition critic, someone who is seemingly incapable of taking the high road, who never misses the opportunity for a partisan cheap shot, who is always, always in attack mode, no matter the issue, the setting or the situation. Certainly there is plenty to criticize in this government, and this Prime Minister. They have mishandled the economy, undermined public finances, ignored rising threats to national security, bollixed immigration, inflamed the housing market, and much else besides, all wrapped in a peculiarly divisive and doctrinaire form of identity politics. Mr. Trudeau’s serial ethical lapses, combined with his tendency to preachiness, combined with his shallowness and vanity, combined with his flippant disdain for detail or the hard work of governing, have long since paled on the Canadian voter. There is a reason his government has reached such historic depths in the polls. Mr. Poilievre’s often incisive criticisms and relentlessly onmessage performance have no doubt contributed to the government’s fall from grace. But there is a time and a place for everything, and if ever there were a time and a place for a change of tone, this would be it. The Conservative Leader’s many and justified complaints about this government would be, if anything, more persuasive, not less, if in the current crisis he were able to say something like: “Whatever our differences, the Prime Minister has my full support as he defends Canada’s interests against Mr. Trump’s unprovoked attacks. The national interest must always come before any particular political interest.” Nothing in that formula would prevent him from presenting constructive criticism of the government’s approach, or indeed framing his “support” as support for his own preferred approach to the question. But the grace note would attract attention, not least in someone who so rarely displays it. It would mark him as someone with the ability to sense the public mood, to offer the strength and calm they are looking for in a crisis – in a word, to lead. Instead Mr. Poilievre has, from the day the tariff threat was issued, sounded almost hysterically harsh. At times he has seemed to take Mr. Trump’s side in the controversy, even appearing behind a podium with the slogan “Fix The Broken Border.” His rhetoric, too, has sounded vaguely … Trumpian. “The Prime Minister,” he said, “has vacated the border and turned it open to anyone who wants to come in.” He is “weak,” “weakened,” “unbearably weak.” He has “lost control of everything.” And this flourish: “With our border in chaos, our economy collapsing and everything broken, we need real, responsible leadership from a strong, smart prime minister who has the brains and backbone to put Canada first.” Canada First, you say. Yup. The phrase, which I have not heard him utter before the last week or so, has cropped up repeatedly. “We need a plan … to put Canada first on the economy and on security.” “I only care about Canada. I want to put our country first.” And so on. I’m not sure what he thinks he is accomplishing with this. Perhaps he worries that the Prime Minister will get a lift out of the crisis, a rally-round-the-flag effect often seen in public polling. Perhaps he is afraid that sections of his base, many of them vocal on social media, are inclined to side with Mr. Trump, especially on border issues, and might stray into the People’s Party fold. Maybe he is betting the public believes Canada will be treated better with someone more in sync with Mr. Trump in charge. Or maybe it’s just that that’s the only gear he’s got. Mr. Poilievre is already unusual in a political leader for being his own attack dog, a task generally assigned to talented thugs and burner MPs. Until now I had been inclined to assume this was strategy of some kind, a matter of zigging while others are zagging. But it may be that Mr. Poilievre is genuinely unable to strike any other note – that his experience and personality permits no other. We shall see. Maybe he will surprise us yet. But it is hard to escape the feeling that the Trump question has become the dominant issue in Canadian politics, and may decide the election.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Coyne, Andrew",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 7, 2024",National security; Political leadership; Prime ministers; Trade deficit; Tariffs,,2024-12-07,The Globe and Mail
Robert Libman: Poilievre isn't helping Canadians in Trump tariff showdown,2024.0,"Pierre Poilievre can see his Christmas present, an election victory, perfectly gift-wrapped sitting right there under the tree. After nine years of the Trudeau administration, which has struggled through complicated economic times and in delivering basic federal government services to Canadians, polls show a decisive Conservative election victory is there for the taking. But if Poilievre wants to ultimately open his gift, he shouldn't be trying to grab it too hastily or too greedily. He must start being more careful in showing that his preoccupation is first and foremost the best interests of Canadians and not his own electoral fortunes. His actions of the past week don't help that perception. Despite his poll numbers, many Canadians are having trouble warming to Poilievre himself He appears snarky and sarcastic at times, rhyming off slogans and unduly focused on blaming Trudeau for everything, rather than offering tangible hope or solutions for the future. Highlighting government shortcomings succeeds in consolidating support between elections and from those who are staunch detractors of the incumbent. During a campaign, however, the light shines much more brightly on the main contenders. To maintain or expand his base, Poilievre will have to start acting more statesmanlike and try to temper his overt partisanship. In response to Donald Trump's boisterous threat last week about slapping 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports, which would devastate our economy, Trudeau was able to quickly score a face-to-face dinner with the incoming U.S. president to discuss the situation. In his reaction to Trudeau's meeting, Poilievre appeared somewhat shell-shocked. He went on - robotically, it seemed - that Trudeau had come back empty-handed and hadn't made any gains, adding that Trudeau is a weak prime minister who's lost control of our borders, immigration, crime and drugs, and of our economy. Trudeau's meeting with Trump was a first step. It could turn out to be a major victory if he somehow succeeds in having Trump back off. If he fails and the tariffs fully materialize, it could be the last nail in the coffin for Trudeau's leadership. Poilievre's comments, however, seemed politically selfish and potentially reckless. He could have risen above partisan politics, as part of Team Canada, like the premiers, by offering his support to the PM in hoping for him to succeed on behalf of all Canadians. Instead, his public comments trying to belittle the PM, who is negotiating on our behalf, compromise our position. It also places Poilievre himself in a lose-lose situation. Based on some of what we've heard from the meeting so far, it's already an uphill battle for Trudeau. His admission to Trump that the tariffs would cripple our economy prompted Trump's questionable comment about Canada ""ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion"" a year, joking (supposedly) that we should become the 51st state. If the PM fails, yes, it may benefit Poilievre's electoral fortunes, but to the severe detriment of the Canadian economy. And if Trudeau manages to succeed, Poilievre will reek of sour grapes compared to the impression he would have left had he taken a more statesmanlike stance in multilateral support of his PM, acting in Canadians' best interests against an external threat. Also this week, after months of the Conservatives having paralyzed the House of Commons with a filibuster related to their demand for documents about alleged misspending of a now-defunct green technology fund, they announced intentions to proceed with more non-confidence motions to try to topple the minority Liberal government The last thing Canadians probably want now before the holidays is for the government to fall and to be thrown into a divisive election. If Poilievre isn't more careful, he may end up ultimately returning the gift that Trudeau so neatly wrapped for him.

Race for Kingston conservative party candidate kicks off; Police board chairman Jarrod Stearns seeks local nomination,2024.0,"The race to find a local challenger for Kingston and the Islands member of Parliament Mark Gerretsen in the next federal election is officially underway. Jarrod Stearns, a longtime entrepreneur and chairman of the Kingston Police Services Board, announced this week he's throwing his hat into the ring to become the Conservative Party of Canada's nominee for the local riding. While there have been rumblings in recent weeks that Kingston Mayor Bryan Paterson was also considering a run for the spot, Stearns is the first to officially declare his intentions. In an interview, Stearns said his passion for making Kingston a better place for future generations is at the heart of his decision to run for office. He also pointed to several concerns that led to his choice to run, including a skyrocketing cost of living, inflation, housing insecurity and what he called a general lack of responsibility when it comes to the current federal government. ""I am very aware that there have been many changes in Canada that seem backward to when I was growing up, and it feels broken,"" Stearns said Thursday. ""Knowing my kids and grandkids are going to inherit this mess we've made - I want to be part of the solution."" Stearns, who moved to Kingston in 2006 and immediately ""fell in love"" with the city, said he has a lengthy track record in leadership and has been an entrepreneur all his life. The experience he's gained as a longtime business owner, coupled with the knowledge from his last five years on the police services board, has ""strengthened (his) ability to manage complex issues and deliver meaningful results for the community,"" he said. The results that are needed, he said, would come with a change in government - both across the country and in Kingston. People are struggling in ways that cannot be measured, he added, since inflation does not include many factors such as grocery, energy or gas prices. ""If you do grocery shopping like I do, you know a lot of the products are up 300 per cent from where they were just two years ago. But that's not discussed,"" he said. ""It's hard for people. We know that. We know the food banks are being used more and more, and there are solutions."" Those solutions are baked into his campaign, he said. This includes balanced budgets, smaller government, less regulation, fiscal responsibility, lower taxes and a change with bail reform. Locally, one of his top priorities would be tackling the housing and addictions crisis. Homelessness is rising and mental illness and addictions are more pervasive than ever, he said. These issues need to be addressed and taken seriously, he said, something he claims has been neglected by current leaders. ""Nothing's working. Until all three levels of government start working together, nothing is going to get fixed,"" he said, adding as a member of parliament he would want to get involved on committees to address these issues locally. ""I want to go there to work. I want to work on the issues I don't think are being worked on."" He also said there were infrastructure projects that have not been prioritized by the federal government, such as the causeway replacement and bringing highspeed rail to the city. Not only would having rail infrastructure in Kingston benefit the city and its residents in general, but it would also provide hundreds of good-paying jobs, he said. ""I would fight for that, because it would mean a lot of jobs, and a lot more people paying taxes in Kingston so the rest of us don't have to have higher tax rates."" He said, more generally, that a conservative politician would serve Kingston and the Islands better right now, adding they would ""be more responsible in parliament"" than the current crop in government. ""I don't feel our member of Parliament is very responsible when it comes to upholding those processes,"" he said. ""There's a lot of embarrassing situations with our member of Parliament. There's a lot of people right across the country that would like to see him not be a member of Parliament"" But he's got a long road ahead of him. Not only is this just the beginning of the process to decide the local conservative candidate, but the riding has been a liberal stronghold since the early eighties. In the last election in 2021, particularly Gerretsen won handily with 41.1 per cent of the vote, with NDP candidate Vic Sahai holding second at 29.3 per cent and Conservative Gary Oosterhof sitting third at 23.7 per cent. Stearns knows that, but said he's ready to put in the work. ""Across the country it will be a wave of blue, but here, it's hard to say,"" he said. ""We have a lot of work to do, which is why I'm putting my name forward."" sbedford@postmedia.com","Kingston Whig - Standard; Kingston, Ont.","Kingston, Ont.","Bedford, Sabrina",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Tax rates; Chairman of the board; Members of Parliament; Parliaments; Political parties,,2024-12-06,Kingston Whig - Standard
Pierre Poilievre’s political playbook tested as Trump prepares White House return:   The uncertainty created by the U.S. president-elect leaves the Conservative Party leader facing a new political reality: He’s no longer in control of the narrative,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s political focus is being tested by the uncertainty that Donald Trump injects into Canadian and international politics. After two years of Mr. Poilievre pushing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over housing and other affordability issues – and with the Conservatives well ahead in the polls – the U.S. president-elect is changing the stakes, said Ginny Roth, who ran Mr. Poilievre’s communications during his 2022 leadership bid and is a partner at Crestview Strategy. “I don’t think Trump is a variable that you can wrest control of,” she said. That leaves Mr. Poilievre facing a new political reality: He’s no longer in control of the narrative. The polls have created an unrealistic expectation for Mr. Poilievre to act as though he is in charge, said Regan Watts, who worked as an adviser to former Conservative foreign affairs minister Lawrence Cannon. “Just because he’s leading in the polls doesn’t make him the prime minister,” Mr. Watts said. “It doesn’t give him all of the obligations of being the prime minister.” The responsibility of managing the Canada-U.S. relationship belongs to the current elected government, Mr. Watts said, not Mr. Poilievre, even as Mr. Trudeau and other political and business leaders urge a Team Canada approach to the issue. Nonetheless, the past two weeks have showcased Mr. Poilievre trying to figure out the new Trump dynamic and what it means for his political future. Mr. Poilievre and his MPs rarely comment in the national media on issues beyond their core agenda, but when Mr. Trump dropped his 25-per-cent tariff threat, which would be devastating to the Canadian economy, it couldn’t be ignored. So he held the first of a series of news conferences with the parliamentary press corps, all responding to the reverberations from Mr. Trump’s threat as it continued to dominated the news cycle. Not responding to Mr. Trump wasn’t an option, and Mr. Poilievre likely also saw it as an important opportunity to frame the coming debate on Canada-U.S. relations his way, Ms. Roth said. “He never wants to take for granted [that] the public will blame Trudeau for what [Poilievre] thinks he should be blamed for,” she said. Mr. Poilievre has said that he believes the tariffs would be unjustified. But, he also blames Mr. Trudeau for loose border and immigration controls. Mr. Trudeau has in turn suggested that amplifies American misinformation. The run of engagements with the national media were heavily scrutinized. Some political pundits assessed Mr. Poilievre as appearing unsettled. But Mr. Watts said what he saw over the course of two weeks was a Conservative Leader figuring out when to use a baseball bat to smash at the government and when to use a scalpel for a more precise response – a sign of maturity, Mr. Watts said, and a readiness to lead. Abacus Data chief executive officer David Coletto said few Canadians thus far name Canada-U.S. relations as a top priority. That, plus Mr. Poilievre’s commanding lead in the polls, mean his response to Mr. Trump, at least for now, likely won’t shift public opinion. A policy on Canada-U.S. relations if Mr. Poilievre becomes prime minister is in the works as he consults with people who have deep ties in U.S. politics. This past week, a coterie of Canadian Conservatives attended the International Democracy Union convention in Washington. The IDU, an alliance of centre-right political parties, is currently led by former prime minister Stephen Harper, who presided over a conference full of Republicans – including Mr. Trump’s current choice for national-security adviser – for three days. Mr. Poilievre was a minister in the Harper government. Then, there is Conservative MP Jamil Jivani who is close friends with vice-president-elect JD Vance, going for lunch with him in Washington on Nov. 13. On Friday, Mr. Vance used social media to amplify Mr. Jivani’s thoughts on what the MP has called the persecution of Christians in Canada. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland didn’t answer when asked this week whether she’s tried to speak to Mr. Jivani for any insight on how the government should approach the U.S. administration, despite Ottawa’s calls for a Team Canada approach to managing Mr. Trump, During a meeting with opposition leaders on Canada-U.S. affairs this week, Mr. Trudeau also did not explicitly ask Mr. Poilievre, or any other party chiefs, whether they had any personal contacts in the U.S. that they’d be willing to call upon to press Canada’s case. Upon leaving the meeting, Mr. Poilievre did say he’d be willing to carry the message of the damage tariffs could do to both countries to anyone with influence in the U.S., though he didn’t answer the question of how he’d do that or with whom. While Mr. Trump’s volatility is a challenge, Mr. Poilievre has long been a student of the populist currents that swept Mr. Trump into office, making it perhaps easier for the Conservative Leader to anticipate what might be coming, Ms. Roth said. “He has more empathy for the Trump voting coalition and more ability to understand Donald Trump than most,” she said. On the other hand, there could be risks for Mr. Poilievre if he is seen as too close to Mr. Trump – or of having the tacit endorsement of his administration, Mr. Coletto said. Mr. Poilievre has knit together a coalition of voters who aren’t in alignment on Mr. Trump. “A sizable portion of his base likes Trump but a sizable portion of his base doesn’t,” Mr. Coletto said. For now, Mr. Poilievre may be on the cusp of regaining control of the narrative. This coming week on Parliament Hill, his party is in charge of the agenda for two days, and on both he intends to call for the defeat of the Liberal government.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Levitz, Stephanie",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 6, 2024",Conservatism; Political leadership; Prime ministers; Tariffs,,2024-12-06,The Globe and Mail

The author, Dr. Kavita Algu, presents a one-sided view of the situation in Gaza. This situation is of course horrific and should never have happened. But there are other positions on it than what is presented; for instance, that it was started by Hamas alone and could have ended had they returned the hostages and agreed to accept Israel's existence. She could have added that billions of dollars of aid were provided to Hamas to improve the conditions of the Palestinian people, which they instead spent on tunnels, weapons, etc., that were intentionally put behind civilian infrastructure. One could go on here, but the point is that there are many sides to a story like this one. I strongly believe the medical establishment should remain neutral on matters such as these.

Families and friends came to enjoy the many activities provided by the Children's Garden, Colborne Lodge, High Park Zoo, Labyrinth and Nature Centre, as well as (sponsored by the Grenadier Fund) hot chocolate, cookies, face painting, a raffle, roasting marshmallows, musical entertainment, local school choirs, labyrinth, Santa handing out gifts from his sack and a tree lighting ceremony. With no access to vehicles, this event has not been held for the past four years. Why? It is not feasible. A wonderful community event has been destroyed.

I've seen much bigger suitcases and backpacks being jammed into overhead bins when there was barely enough room for my necessary medical equipment.

Critics are calling it 'creepy,' Dec. 4 No one bats an eyelash when an undercover team busts a drug ring or infiltrates a car theft operation. They are, in fact, applauded for good work. But put the undercover agents on the TTC to catch fare evaders and suddenly we're clutching at our pearls. Shelagh Pizey-Allen of the TTC advocacy group claims this will ""create more conflict and an environment of mistrust."" How does currying trust from people who intentionally evade paying fares address the problem? You can ""educate"" all you want, but will that really deter intentional evaders? They know the difference between paying the fare and not doing so, and they choose not to do so. I get that there are TTC riders who need to get to work or essential appointments who simply cannot afford to pay the fare. This should not be a TTC problem. It should be a public welfare issue. If someone who needs to ride public transit can't afford to do so, provide them with a prepaid card to allow them to access the TTC legally and with some dignity.

Michael Bines, Toronto Nothing but empty criticism Poilievre accuses Trudeau of coming home empty-handed after Trump, PM hail 'productive' Florida meeting, Dec. 1 What a great job it is to be leader of the Opposition. All Pierre Poilievre has to do is criticize. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes to meet Donald Trump, he can criticize him for not getting anything substantive in return. If Trudeau didn't go, he would criticize him for not taking action. No matter what Trudeau does, it's never good enough. I thought the role of Opposition leader was to offer constructive criticism. But Poilievre offers nothing but empty slogans. He believes everything is broken. Not so. Canada is a great country, but he seems to dislike what we have. Perhaps, he should decamp and find a country he likes. Gary Johnson, Stouffville What sort of society do we Canadians want?

Poilievre submits no-confidence motion:   Conservative leader attempts to use Singh's words against him in push for vote next week,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he agrees with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on one thing: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals are too weak to fight for Canadians. Poilievre kicked off debate in the House of Commons Thursday on a cheekily worded Conservative motion designed to use Singh's own words against him. The motion quotes some of Singh's harshest language against the Liberal government along with his staunch support for organized labour. Poilievre told the House his non-confidence motion will afford MPs the chance to vote on the ""wise things that he said"" when it's expected to come up next week. He said if Singh votes against it, that means ""he does not want to take responsibility"" for his words and have voters ""judge his record and his plans."" The Conservative opposition motion quotes Singh accusing the Liberals of being ""too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people,"" and that the Liberals will always ensure ""unions have no power"" by stepping in to stop labour disputes. That came after Ottawa's recent interventions to end disruptions by striking rail and port workers by asking the Canada Industrial Relations Board to intervene. But Singh has said he won't play Conservative games and will vote against the motion. In the back-and-forth, NDP MP Matthew Green scoffed at Poilievre's remarks and accused him of cosplaying as a supporter of organized labour. At one point, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen accused Poilievre of using a prop, which is against House rules, to troll the Liberals. As Poilievre held onto his speaking notes, he had conspicuously placed at the bottom of the stack of papers a New York Times article featuring a large photo of Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a headline suggesting she could be Trudeau's successor. But it wasn't just the Conservatives playing tactical parliamentary shenanigans on Thursday. A surprise move by the NDP forced a debate on abortion access to delay the Conservative motion and siphon away House of Commons airtime on it Thursday. Ahead of Poilievre's motion coming up, NDP MP Heather McPherson suddenly seized the parliamentary remote control and changed the channel by springing a debate on a Foreign Affairs Committee report tabled in the House. McPherson also used the report, about Canada's global assistance for sexual and reproductive health rights, to pivot to domestic abortion issues by accusing the Conservatives of being beholden to abortion opponents and the Liberals of failing to protect access to services. ""The Liberals are too weak to stand up to premiers - those conservatives premiers - who are restricting access to women's health care,"" she said. When the Tories attempted to return to the regular scheduled programming, the Liberals and NDP ganged up and voted against them, further delaying the Conservative motion. The Tories charged that the NDP had hijacked the House agenda to protect Singh from a tough spot. Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer said it was a ""desperate attempt to limit debate"" through a ""procedural trick."" The Liberal government will face a raft of opposition motions in the coming days.","Toronto Star; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,"Torstar Syndication Services, a Division of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited","Dec 6, 2024",Conservatism; Womens health; Abortion; No confidence motions & votes,,2024-12-06,Toronto Star
Poilievre offers Freeland time for fall fiscal update,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is offering to give up time on an opposition day in the House of Commons to allow Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland to present the government's fall fiscal update. Poilievre says he will allow Freeland two hours to present the fall economic statement on Monday - a day allocated for Conservatives to present their own motions in Parliament. The Conservative leader says he'll give up that time so the government can tell Canadians whether it kept a promise to cap the federal deficit at $40 billion. The parliamentary budget officer is projecting the government will exceed its own fiscal guardrail with a deficit of $46.8 billion for the previous fiscal year. ""Not only will we co-operate to let her introduce that fall update, we will actually give her a Christmas gift: We'll give her two hours out of our Conservative opposition motion day on Monday for her to stand on her feet and tell us how much she's lost control of the nation's finances,"" Poilievre told reporters Wednesday morning. A senior government official says delivering a fall economic statement less than 48 hours before a Bank of Canada interest rate announcement would be ""irresponsible and not a serious suggestion."" Freeland has not yet announced a date for the fiscal update, telling reporters on Tuesday that the filibuster in Parliament is standing in the way of the government's work. The Liberal government has not said whether it will meet its own pledge on the deficit. The House of Commons has been in gridlock for weeks as opposition parties demand the government hand over unredacted documents related to misspending at a green technology fund to the RCMP. Government House leader Karina Gould reacted to Poilievre's offer by calling on the Conservatives to end the filibuster. The filibuster will be placed on pause Thursday after Speaker Greg Fergus cleared the way for the four remaining opposition days to take place over the next two weeks. Three of those opposition days are allocated to the Conservatives, and one to the NDP. The Conservatives were assigned Dec. 5, Dec. 9 and Dec. 10 and the NDP were assigned Dec. 6. The Conservatives are expected to use their first of their three to introduce another non-confidence motion quoting NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's own explanation in why he pulled his party out of its agreement with the Liberals to prop up the minority government. Singh said yesterday he would not support that motion. The NDP will introduce its own opposition day motion on Friday to advance affordability policies. The motion calls for Canada to permanently remove the GST on what the NDP calls essentials. This includes grocery store meals, children's clothes, diapers, home heating, cellphone and internet bills. Last month, Singh promised to enact this policy if the NDP forms government after the next election. His party supported the Liberals temporary pause in the GST on holiday-themed items including toys, children's clothes and restaurant meals even though it did not go as far as he wanted. The NDP motion also calls on the expansion of what the government calls the working Canadians rebate, which the Liberals intend to send to anyone who earned up to $150,000 in employment income in 2023. The NDP wants to see these onetime $250 payments also go to fully retired seniors, people who rely on disability benefits and ""others in need.""

Poilievre says Liberals hiding finances:   Tory leader wants government to deliver fiscal update,2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is challenging the government to disclose details about federal finances that are late to arrive this year, suggesting the Liberal administration is hiding bad news about the deficit. Poilievre stopped in front of a cluster of reporters Wednesday morning to say his party will carve out a two-hour window of time in the House of Commons on Monday so that Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland can deliver a fiscal update - a suggestion Freeland later rejected as ""utterly absurd."" ""Why won't the finance minister tell us the true number? What's she hiding? Is she hiding that Trudeau lost control of the deficit this year, just like every year?"" Poilievre said, before refusing to take questions. ""Stand on your feet Monday at 4 p.m. We'll clear the deck so you can do it, and tell us how badly you've lost control of the nation's finances and the inflation and taxes Canadians pay as a result."" The Liberal government is unusually late this year in publishing annual reports that included audited results from the previous fiscal year, sparking concerns from the current and former parliamentary budget watchdogs about a lack of spending transparency. Asked about the concerns on Tuesday, Freeland dodged questions about why they are delayed, saying only that the Liberal government would release the reports and present a mid-year fiscal update ""this year."" Freeland has insisted the federal government's fiscal standing is strong, with lower debt compared to peer countries in the Group of Seven. She has also suggested the economic update has not been released because of a weeks-long Conservative filibuster in the House, in which the Tories are blocking normal parliamentary business to try and force the government to hand over unredacted documents related to alleged corruption at an arms-length green tech agency. Freeland picked up that theme again on Wednesday, when she shot down Poilievre's offer to clear time so she could provide the fiscal update in the House. ""This proposal from the Conservatives is like an arsonist who set the fire in the first place, saying 'Don't worry about, I'll come with a fire truck for a couple of hours, but tomorrow I'll be back again with matches,' "" Freeland told reporters, adding that she will present the fiscal update ""soon."" Meanwhile, ahead of the Liberals' cabinet meeting, Treasury Board President Anita Anand said Freeland is working ""extremely hard"" on providing a fall economic statement, and that Poilievre's demand will not dictate when she presents it. ""I'll leave it to her to decide when to do that in the House of Commons,"" Anand said. ""She'll do it when she's ready."" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he would take Poilievre's demand with a ""grain of salt"" and noted the Conservatives have clogged Parliament with their filibuster. ""Unlock the Parliament. There are serious things to be done,"" he said. Asked about Poilievre's offer, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said it's irrelevant, since the government could release the economic update anywhere - they don't need to do so in Parliament. He added, however, that he believes the Liberal government does not have a ""credible"" reading of the economic situation, and is pursuing election-ready policies ""without understanding the real consequences that it could bring."" Last year, after a huge spike in federal spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Liberal government set itself a series of fiscal targets to keep government debt in check. Those targets included a pledge to cap Ottawa's budget deficit at $40 billion and ensure federal debt declines in proportion to the size of the national economy. But it's not clear whether the government has managed to hit that target. Reports that are published each year, typically before the end of October, show the audited results of the 2023-24 fiscal year, which ended in October, including the final size of the deficit. As of Wednesday evening, neither of those reports has been published this year. The government also usually presents a fall economic statement before the end of November, but so far the Liberal government has not done so. In October, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux published a report that estimated the government blew past its promise to limit the deficit with a $46.8-billion shortfall last fiscal year. At a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, Giroux said it's ""very uncomfortable"" for parliamentarians to be asked to vote on new government spending when they still have no access to the precise financial standing of the government. In recent days, the Liberals have proposed almost $6 billion in new spending to pay for a two-month GST holiday on a host of consumer goods - from Christmas trees and video games to beer and food - and to hand out $250 in one-time payouts to millions of Canadians who earned less than $150,000 in income last year.

After reading about the cost incurred to relocate the Ontario Science Center, I simply yawned and turned the page. It is becoming more and more obvious that Ford's agenda is to simply outdo the former Liberal government in every way, and this includes wasting our tax dollars and digging a deficit hole that appears to be more and more disastrous with every passing day. I suppose it's too late to expect the average Ontarian to understand that the future financial well-being of Ontario, and that of our children, is worth far more than $200 and a free licence plate sticker. Woe is us. David Ottenbrite, Cambridge, Ont. The auditor general's report clearly shows that the PC government is wasting the taxpayers' money and Ontario is falling further behind than ever.

Who was this smiling person sitting next to the Canadian prime minister? The caption said it was the president-elect of the U.S., and I suppose that's true.

I have family spread across Canada. Even if postal service resumed within a few days, the typical Canada Post deadlines for sending holiday parcels is well before Dec. 14 to ensure that they arrive before Christmas. The Liberal government should have been on to this GST tax holiday idea a month or more earlier, starting the tax holiday on Nov. 14 and extending it until Jan. 14. Linda Pim, Inglewood Canada Post workers have little leverage It's understandable why the postal workers chose this time of year to threaten a strike in hopes of Canada Post giving in to their demands to avoid it. Christmas is the busiest time of the year for them, with so many people sending letters, cards and packages. It would normally cause havoc. However, what they fail to understand is that this isn't 40 or 50 years ago, when Canada Post was the only way to send letters and parcels. Nowadays there are numerous delivery companies that can, and will, pick up the slack.

This number would be the same as the number of taxicabs in Toronto.

It is clear that solely repairing these devices every time they are vandalized is not an effective solution. Some cities in the GTA are addressing this concern by installing speed cameras on the poles of street lights at a higher height to prevent easy access to these devices. These photo radar cameras are not only harder to reach, but they are also difficult to spot, which can reduce the chances of vandalism. By securing these devices against vandalism, the city will be able to effectively enforce speed limits and ensure the safety of all Torontonians.

Liberals dismiss path for economic update:   Poilievre says two hours on opposition day could be allotted to Freeland to present financial statement,2024.0,"Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has poured cold water on a suggestion from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre that would allow the government to deliver a fall economic statement despite the continuing filibuster in Parliament. Ms. Freeland said Mr. Poilievre’s proposal to allot two hours from an opposition day Monday so she could provide an update was “utterly absurd.” “This proposal from the Conservatives is like an arsonist who set the fire in the first place, saying, ‘Don’t worry about it. I’ll come with a fire truck for a couple of hours. But tomorrow I’ll be back again with matches,’ ” she told reporters on her way into a Senate committee meeting late Wednesday. Though Ms. Freeland has cited the logjam in Parliament as a reason she has yet to deliver an update, Mr. Poilievre accused the Liberals earlier Wednesday of holding the fall economic statement back because the deficit is higher than projected. “Common-sense Conservatives are calling for the Finance Minister to introduce a fall update to indicate whether she’s keeping her promise to cap the deficit at $40-billion, or whether Trudeau’s completely lost control of the deficit once again,” he told reporters on his way into his party’s weekly caucus meeting. On Monday, the Conservatives will control the Commons agenda for what’s known as an opposition day, which the Speaker recently ruled should take priority over the filibuster. The filibuster is related to the government’s refusal to fully comply with a House of Commons order to hand over documents related to a green technology fund. While it is being led by the Conservatives, neither the Bloc Québécois nor the NDP have been willing to give the minority government the required votes to shut it down. All say that if the government were to hand over the documents, the matter could move on. The Conservatives are using their opposition day for a motion of non-confidence in the government. It is not expected to pass. The two hours Mr. Poilievre is offering up would come from the time allotted for that debate. The fall economic statement updates the country’s financial picture and in recent years has been accompanied by legislation for new spending. The update has been delivered in December before, but more often has come before the end of November. Ms. Freeland said Wednesday that she will present it “soon.” The Globe and Mail reported last week that the government has been looking at alternatives to delivering the update in the House of Commons because of the filibuster, but Ms. Freeland said that’s where it belongs. Next week, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem is scheduled to deliver his final interest rate decision of the year, and the government would likely want to avoid disrupting his announcement with new financial information. That leaves late next week and the first two days of the following week, as the House breaks on Dec. 17. If the update is paired with legislation to adopt new measures, the government would need the support of at least one other party to break or suspend the filibuster to debate or pass the legislation. Or Ms. Freeland could deliver an update to a parliamentary committee or outside Parliament entirely. There is precedent for both options from previous Liberal and Conservatives governments. Depending on the timing of any proposed measures, the government could also wait until the new year to introduce legislation related to the update. Ms. Freeland’s April budget projected the deficit for the fiscal year ending March 31 would be $40-billion, barely within the fiscal anchor, or target, of $40.1-billion she announced in last year’s fall update. More than eight months after that fiscal year came to an end, the government has not yet released the public accounts indicating whether that target was met. Adding to the government’s fiscal pressures is the promise to send $250 cheques to working Canadians earning less than $150,000. The initiative is expected to cost $4.68-billion, but so far both the Bloc and NDP have said they will only support it if it is expanded to more Canadians. On Friday, the House will debate an NDP opposition day motion calling for all adult Canadians who netted less than $150,000 last year, whether or not they were working, to receive the cheques. The motion also calls for parts of the federal government’s twomonth sales tax holiday to be made permanent. The NDP said the GST should be lifted for good on things such as grocery store meals, internet and cellphone bills, home heating, diapers and children’s clothing. The House will vote on the NDP proposals Monday. Ms. Freeland has declined to say whether the government is open to the proposals.

PM calls out Poilievre’s criticisms of his tariff approach:   Canadian attribute of pulling together when the country is threatened seems ‘unavailable’ to the Tory Leader: Trudeau,2024.0,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre of lacking a “basic Canadian attribute” in failing to embrace his Team Canada approach to Donald Trump’s tariff threats. Mr. Poilievre has argued in recent days that the Prime Minister’s immigration, justice and drug policies have left Canada vulnerable to American criticism. Mr. Trump last week said that upon taking office, he would impose 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products until those countries stop the flow of illegal migrants, and drugs such as fentanyl, into the United States. Last week, the Conservative Leader mocked a teleconference that Mr. Trudeau held with premiers, suggesting these are of little benefit. “What we don’t need is a spectacle of a bunch of politicians sitting around tables, meeting and holding photoops,” he said at the time. “What we really need is an action plan with tangibles.” Mr. Trudeau, who recently accused Mr. Poilievre of “amplifying the erroneous narratives that the Americans are putting forward” about Canada, on Wednesday alleged that Mr. Poilievre lacks a characteristic found in most Canadians. “One of the things we’ve seen throughout our history, when Canada is threatened, when it’s challenged with crisis, when people want ill of Canadians, Canadians pull together across partisan stripes, across backgrounds, across the country, to stand up for our neighbours, to stand up for Canadians,” the Prime Minister said in the House of Commons. “That’s certainly what we were able to do as a country eight years ago,” he said, referring to the first Trump presidency. “Unfortunately, this basic Canadian attribute seems unavailable to that Leader of the Opposition, who can’t help himself on playing politics with Canadians’ well-being,” Mr. Trudeau added. In response, Mr. Poilievre alleged that the Prime Minister, through his environmental and tax policies, is making it easier for Mr. Trump to divert business investment to the United States. “I understand why President Trump wants to take Canadian jobs, but why is this Prime Minister trying to help him do it?” He argued that Mr. Trudeau is to blame when criminals take ingredients for fentanyl and “they’re cooked into that poison now threatening our trade relationship with the U.S.” The Prime Minister retorted that Mr. Poilievre is there “for a photo-op, but he’s not there to do the work of delivering based on science, based on compassion, based on a public-health approach, on dealing with the toxic drug epidemic.” According to numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in the past fiscal year, U.S. border-patrol officers stopped people 23,721 times trying to cross illegally from Canada, more than double the 10,021 the year before. But it pales in comparison with the Mexican border, where officers stopped people more than 1.5 million times in the past fiscal year. According to U.S. government figures, border guards intercepted 19.5 kilograms of fentanyl along the Canadian border last year, which is 0.2 per cent of the nearly 11 tonnes intercepted in the United States. Separately on Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that former White House adviser Peter Navarro will return as a senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing. That suggests Mr. Navarro could play a role in Mr. Trump’s plan to reopen the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement for changes that tilt the trade-deal rules more in the Americans’ favour. Mr. Navarro was held in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Sentenced to four months in prison in 2024, he described his conviction as the “partisan weaponization of the judicial system.” Mr. Navarro had strong words for Mr. Trudeau during the first Trump presidency when he suggested that the Prime Minister deserved to go to hell for retaliating against Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. The spat began at the end of the G7 meeting in Quebec, when Mr. Trudeau reaffirmed that Canada would retaliate against Mr. Trump’s metals tariffs, which were charging Canada, Mexico and the European Union 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum exported to the United States. Mr. Trudeau told reporters that Ottawa “will not be pushed around” by Washington. In responding to this, Mr. Navarro told Fox News that there’s “a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door,” he said.

Poilievre dares Freeland to reveal 'true number' of the budget deficit in economic statement,2024.0,"OTTAWA - Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is challenging Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland to table her fall economic statement after she accused him of delaying the process. ""We'll give her two hours out of our Conservative opposition motion day on Monday for her to stand on her feet and tell us how much she's lost control of the nation's finances,"" said Poilievre on Wednesday. Poilievre's comments come after the minister suggested Tuesday afternoon that the government was ""keen to deliver an economic statement in the fall"" but has been unable to do so because the Conservatives are filibustering the House of Commons with a question of privilege. ""That has real consequences in terms of the government's ability to do the work that we need to do for Canadians,"" said Freeland during a press conference. The government is not required to present an economic statement to the House of Commons, and for many years the previous Conservative government presented it outside of Parliament. But Freeland was clear about her intention to continue her habit of introducing it on the floor of the House of Commons ""where the work of Parliament is done."" In October, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux said his analysis showed that the government ""will not meet its fiscal commitment"" to keep the deficit below $40 billion, and that it had reached $46.8 billion in 2023-2024. ""We'll present a full fiscal picture when we present the fall economic statement,"" she said, insisting that it would be presented in the fall, which means it would have to be tabled before Dec. 21. Poilievre said the delay suggested the minister may be hiding the real numbers, pointing to Freeland's commitment to a $40-billion cap on the federal government's deficit. ""Why won't the finance minister tell us the true number? What's she hiding? Is she hiding that Trudeau lost control of the deficit this year, just like every year?"" he asked. ""Maybe they're fighting over how big and out of control the deficit actually is. Once again, such a fight would be a loss of control by the prime minister,"" he added.

"Poilievre changes the channel to get back on message:   There’s nothing unusual about an opposition leader attacking the prime minister. But in this case, Mr. Poilievre’s amplification of Mr. Trump’s criticisms left the impression he’s willing to side with Mr. Trump against Canadian interests as long as it helps to attack Mr. Trudeau",2024.0,"Pierre Poilievre had to come up with something. He had strayed off message. He had to find his way back to safety. On Wednesday, he did that by calling for the Liberal government to deliver a fall economic statement – and even offering, with faux magnanimity, to give Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland a couple of hours of a Conservative opposition day in the paralyzed House of Commons so she could do it. That was a channel-changer. Last Friday’s dinner meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump seemed to spook Mr. Poilievre. At least, he reacted with vitriol in a Sunday press conference, where he came out, guns-a-blazing, standing behind a sign that said “Fix the Broken Border.” There’s nothing unusual about an opposition leader attacking the prime minister. But in this case, Mr. Poilievre’s amplification of Mr. Trump’s criticisms left the impression he’s willing to side with Mr. Trump against Canadian interests as long as it helps to attack Mr. Trudeau. It played particularly badly in Quebec among pundits who typically disdain Mr. Trudeau. That isn’t likely to radically alter the political landscape. Mr. Poilievre is way ahead in opinion polls, and Mr. Trudeau doesn’t seem to be able to do anything to change that. But it’s remarkable that a politician who seems so comfortably on track to become the next prime minister just couldn’t find another club in his bag other than the one he uses to hit Mr. Trudeau over the head. Mr. Poilievre knocked himself off message because he responds to every issue by rhetorically firebombing his opponent. The Conservative Leader had spent many months relentlessly pounding away at the same points with eye-glazing repetition of a four-phrase slogan: Axe the tax, build the homes, fix the budget, stop the crime. Mr. Poilievre’s staff acted on a disciplinary principle that almost any day spent on anything else was a deviation from a winning strategy. But on Sunday, Mr. Poilievre found himself complaining that asylum-seekers are taking Canadian jobs and sparking discussion about whether the lack of a Team Canada approach to Mr. Trump might harm Canada’s interests. Mr. Poilievre obviously eventually recognized it was a mistake. On Tuesday afternoon, after Mr. Trudeau briefed opposition leaders on his Mar-a-Lago dinner with Mr. Trump, the Conservative Leader emerged to emphasize to reporters that the tariffs Mr. Trump is threatening to impose on Canada would be “unfair and unjustified” and that he had told the Prime Minister he would make those arguments to “put Canada first, which is what we all need to do.” Then Mr. Poilievre pivoted to talking about carbon taxes. Back to “axe the tax.” By Wednesday, he was trying to direct the audience’s attention to budget matters, offering up his party’s time in the Commons and calling on the government to release a fall economic statement. Back to “fix the budget.” That’s usually more comfortable ground for Mr. Poilievre. Even there, he’d been nudged into slightly awkward territory recently. The Liberal government’s announcement of a vote-buying tax holiday on items such as wine and Christmas trees had Mr. Poilievre finding himself arguing against a tax cut. And against a $250 rebate for working Canadians. Highlighting the Liberals’ fall economic statement helps Mr. Poilievre return to his agenda: blasting the Liberal government on the economy, spending and tough times for ordinary folks. Affordability is still the key issue, and Ms. Freeland will be under pressure to offer more to help Canadians make ends meet. But a fiscal update might also reveal the government is blowing through the fiscal targets set by Ms. Freeland herself. Mr. Poilievre managed to grab attention by offering to give up a few hours of the Conservatives’ own opposition day so the government could present the economic statement – since the Conservatives have gummed up the House of Commons with a continuous filibuster of their own privilege motion. Ms. Freeland might not take him up on it. She might move to deliver her fall update in a speech outside the Commons. But offering the government a little bit of the Tories’ time was just the gimmick Mr. Poilievre needed to shift attention – and get back to his message.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Campbell, Clark",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 4, 2024",Conservatism; Prime ministers,,2024-12-04,The Globe and Mail

Mr. Trudeau told reporters that Ottawa “will not be pushed around” by Washington. In responding to this, Mr. Navarro told Fox News that there’s “a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door,” he said.

"Poilievre fumbles the Trump crisis: a missed opportunity to show himself as a prime minister-in-waiting:   In the wake of the U.S. tariff threat, the Conservative Leader has looked jittery, uncertain and off-key",2024.0,"That was quite the meeting at Mar-a-Lago. As our Steven Chase reports, they started in the Library Bar, beneath the portrait of a much younger Donald Trump “in a white V-neck sweater and white pants.” The Prime Minister met first with Judge Jeanine Pirro, of Fox News fame, before the president-elect joined them. The meeting itself was held over dinner on the patio, among the club members and their guests. Mr. Trump amused himself by selecting songs from his iPad to play through the patio speakers – “two versions of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah , a song from the musical Cats , as well as work by Luciano Pavarotti” – stopping the conversation at various stages to point out a highlight. So just your regular working meeting between two world leaders. It was the Prime Minister who had first suggested the meeting in an election-night call. It had taken the following three weeks to nail it down. The days leading up to it had been filled with intense preparation. Once in the meeting the Prime Minister and his officials made a determined effort to impress upon Mr. Trump that the Canadian border was not the porous menace he believed, but also advising him of the measures they were putting in place to secure it: drones, helicopters, personnel, the works. And what did they receive in return? Bupkis. No assurance of any kind with regard to the 25-per-cent tariff Mr. Trump has been threatening, since that supper-hour social media post, to impose. No indication of what measures, if any, would induce him to change his mind. Just a volley of complaints about how Canada was “ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100-billion” by which he apparently meant the U.S. trade deficit with Canada (it’s nowhere near that large but never mind). Oh, and a little “joke,” which the Trump team carefully leaked to friendly media, about Canada being annexed as the 51st state, with the Prime Minister allowed to remain as its governor. Ha ha ha. A few things should be clear from this exchange, if they were not before. It never was about the border. Nothing we do about the border – not that there is much that can be done – is likely to avert the tariff that is coming our way. Mr. Trump cooked up the border “crisis” solely to provide himself with a legal and political pretext to do, on national security grounds, what he was going to do anyway. He is going to do it because he believes in tariffs – because he sees trade, as he sees life, solely in terms of winners and losers; because he understands a trade deficit, not as, essentially, an accounting identity, the flip side of a capital surplus, but as an indication that one country is winning and another is losing; because, most of all, every economist regards tariffs as an abomination, and because the closest thing Mr. Trump has to a code is always to do the opposite of whatever expert opinion recommends. So we can turn ourselves inside out on the border to please him. Mr. Trump may even seem to entertain our efforts for a time. This will produce in him another frisson, when at length he decides to impose them anyway: not only for the pleasure the tariffs themselves will bring, but the pleasure of crushing and humiliating Justin Trudeau. Even so, it is hard to fault the Prime Minister for trying. It is easy to say that the effort was doomed, even foolish; that Mr. Trump does not operate by any of the normal rules – of human behaviour, let alone international diplomacy; that efforts to appease him only offer him an opportunity to do what he likes best, to dominate. But to many people the Prime Minister will nevertheless have looked practical, reasonable, adult, in all, prime ministerial. It is not a given that Mr. Trump’s bullying will be to Mr. Trudeau’s disadvantage, politically. Mr. Trump’s unreasonableness is well known. If Mr. Trudeau is seen to have gone the extra mile, or 1,300, to deal with him; if he then is forced to take retaliatory measures, painful as they may be, the public may conclude that he has made the best of a bad hand. They may even conclude that Canada is likely to suffer less from Mr. Trump’s depredations under Mr. Trudeau, given his experience in dealing with Mr. Trump, than they would under another leader. I am not saying they would be right to draw this conclusion. Neither am I saying they necessarily will. But it is not a possibility one can rule out. Where does this leave Mr. Trudeau’s primary domestic antagonist, Pierre Poilievre? In the wake of the Trump tariff threat the Conservative Leader has looked jittery, uncertain, off-key. I think he senses the political danger. He knows, I think, that if there is one issue that can let Mr. Trudeau up off the mat, however implausible it may seem at the moment, it is this. If Mr. Trudeau’s appearance with Mr. Trump struck you as cringeworthy, try to imagine how Mr. Poilievre would look next to him. Would he look like – behave like – a prime minister? Would he conduct himself with the dignity and the self-confidence that the job requires, knowing when to speak up and when to stay silent, when to show his hand and when to keep his cards in reserve? Or would he look boyish, callow, too eager to impress; talk too much, give away too much, signal insecurity throughout? It’s difficult to say, of course. All one can do – all the public can do – is draw inferences from what we already know of Mr. Poilievre’s character and judgment, extrapolating from his comportment to date to predict how he will behave in future. And what we have seen of him to date has been, not a future prime minister, but a perpetual opposition critic, someone who is seemingly incapable of taking the high road, who never misses the opportunity for a partisan cheap shot, who is always, always in attack mode, no matter the issue, the setting or the situation. Certainly there is plenty to criticize in this government, and this Prime Minister. They have mishandled the economy, undermined public finances, ignored rising threats to national security, bollixed immigration, inflamed the housing market, and much else besides, all wrapped in a peculiarly divisive and doctrinaire form of identity politics. Mr. Trudeau’s serial ethical lapses, combined with his tendency to preachiness, combined with his shallowness and vanity, combined with his flippant disdain for detail or the hard work of governing, have long since paled on the Canadian voter. There is a reason his government has reached such historic depths in the polls. Mr. Poilievre’s often incisive criticisms and relentlessly on-message performance have no doubt contributed to the government’s fall from grace. But there is a time and a place for everything, and if ever there were a time and a place for a change of tone, this would be it. The Conservative Leader’s many and justified complaints about this government would be, if anything, more persuasive, not less, if in the current crisis he were able to say something like: “Whatever our differences, the Prime Minister has my full support as he defends Canada’s interests against Mr. Trump’s unprovoked attacks. The national interest must always come before any particular political interest.” Nothing in that formula would prevent him from presenting constructive criticism of the government’s approach, or indeed framing his “support” as support for his own preferred approach to the question. But the grace note would attract attention, not least in someone who so rarely displays it. It would mark him as someone with the ability to sense the public mood, to offer the strength and calm they are looking for in a crisis – in a word, to lead . Instead Mr. Poilievre has, from the day the tariff threat was issued, sounded almost hysterically harsh. At times he has seemed to take Mr. Trump’s side in the controversy, even appearing behind a podium with the slogan “Fix The Broken Border.” His rhetoric, too, has sounded vaguely … Trumpian. “The Prime Minister,” he said, “has vacated the border and turned it open to anyone who wants to come in.” He is “weak,” “weakened,” “unbearably weak.” He has “lost control of everything.” And this flourish: “with our border in chaos, our economy collapsing and everything broken, we need real, responsible leadership from a strong, smart prime minister who has the brains and backbone to put Canada first.” Canada First, you say. Yup. The phrase, which I have not heard him utter before the last week or so, has cropped up repeatedly. “We need a plan … to put Canada first on the economy and on security.” “I only care about Canada. I want to put our country first.” And so on. I’m not sure what he thinks he is accomplishing with this. Perhaps he worries that the Prime Minister will get a lift out of the crisis, a rally-round-the-flag effect often seen in public polling. Perhaps he is afraid that sections of his base, many of them vocal on social media, are inclined to side with Mr. Trump, especially on border issues, and might stray into the People’s Party fold. Maybe he is betting the public believes Canada will be treated better with someone more in sync with Mr. Trump in charge. Or maybe it’s just that that’s the only gear he’s got. Mr. Poilievre is already unusual in a political leader for being his own attack dog, a task generally assigned to talented thugs and burner MPs. Until now I had been inclined to assume this was strategy of some kind, a matter of zigging while others are zagging. But it may be that Mr. Poilievre is genuinely unable to strike any other note – that his experience and personality permits no other. We shall see. Maybe he will surprise us yet. But it is hard to escape the feeling that the Trump question has become the dominant issue in Canadian politics, and may decide the election.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Coyne, Andrew",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 4, 2024",National security; Political leadership; Prime ministers; Trade deficit; Tariffs,,2024-12-04,The Globe and Mail
"Poilievre offers Liberals a window during opposition day to deliver economic update:   The Conservative Leader accused the Liberals of holding back because the deficit is much higher than projected, while Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland referenced the ongoing filibuster in the House of Commons",2024.0,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre offered to give over two hours of debate time on Monday so Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland can deliver a fall economic update to the House of Commons, a proffer that came a day after Ms. Freeland suggested the current parliamentary logjam is a reason she’s yet to provide the fiscal statement. Mr. Poilievre accused the Liberals of holding back on the nation’s finances because the deficit is much higher than projected. “Common sense Conservatives are calling for the Finance Minister to introduce a fall update to indicate whether she’s keeping her promise to cap the deficit at $40-billion, or whether (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau’s completely lost control of the deficit once again,” he told reporters Wednesday on his way into his party’s weekly caucus meeting. Monday, the Conservatives have control of the House of Commons agenda for what’s known as an opposition day, and they are using it for a motion of non-confidence in the Liberals, which is not expected to pass. Mr. Poilievre said they’d be willing to devote two hours of their time, however, so the economic update can be delivered. “The challenge is over to Chrystia Freeland and Justin Trudeau,” he said. He did not take questions. Ms. Freeland’s office had no immediate comment on Mr. Poilievre’s offer. Other Liberal cabinet ministers on their way into their own party caucus meeting Wednesday batted away the idea. “I don’t think that Pierre Poilievre’s offer is going to be what moves her to present her financial update and the fall economic statement to Canadians,” Treasury Board President Anita Anand said. “She’s working hard on it and she’ll do it when she’s ready.” Ms. Freeland was asked repeatedly on Tuesday why the fall economic statement has yet to be delivered, and referenced the ongoing Conservative-led filibuster in the House of Commons over the government’s refusal to fully release documents related to a green technology fund. The Globe and Mail reported last week that the government has been looking at alternatives to delivering the update on the floor of the House of Commons as a result, but Ms. Freeland insisted Tuesday it should be delivered in Parliament. “The best way to deliver a fall economic statement is to stand up in the House of Commons and deliver it,” she said. “That is the best for all Canadians and for Canadian MPs. People should be asking the Conservatives what purpose is being served by making this so challenging.” Ms. Freeland’s April budget projected that the deficit for the fiscal year that ended March 31 would be $40-billion, just barely within the fiscal anchor, or target, of $40.1-billion she announced in last year’s fall update. However more than eight months after that fiscal year came to an end, the government has not yet released the public accounts that will show whether that target was actually met.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Levitz, Stephanie; Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 4, 2024",Fiscal years,,2024-12-04,The Globe and Mail
Trudeau warns Poilievre against amplifying 'erroneous narratives' about Canada-U.S. border,2024.0,"OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emerged from a closed-door meeting with opposition leaders on Tuesday to warn his Conservative rival against amplifying ""erroneous narratives"" that he says Americans are using about the Canada-U.S. border. Trudeau delivered the caution to Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre in the House of Commons after they met face to face, along with other party leaders, to discuss Trudeau's meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump last Friday. ""What (Trudeau) said was, we don't negotiate against ourselves. It would be helpful in the coming weeks and months if we didn't in any way amplify the kind of messaging and language that the Trump administration is using to attack Canada,"" Green Party Leader Elizabeth May recounted to reporters after the meeting. Trudeau invited party leaders to be briefed on the discussion he had with Trump and the Canada-U.S. relationship. The federal Liberals are hoping to talk Trump off his threat of imposing a 25-per-cent tariff on Canadian imports over concerns about illegal immigration and fentanyl flowing into the United States. He made the same threat to Mexico. During Tuesday's question period, Poilievre told MPs that ""Trudeau has lost control of everything."" ""He lost control of the borders, lost control of immigration, lost control of spending and the deficit,"" said Poilievre. ""This has put Canada in an unbearably weak position."" Trudeau responded by saying he believes Poilievre ""needs to reflect carefully on whether he really wants to amplify the erroneous narratives,"" which he says Americans are advancing when it comes to issues surrounding the border. ""Less than one per cent of migrants coming into the United States irregularly come from Canada, where .02 per cent of fentanyl coming into the United States comes from Canada,"" Trudeau said. ""Amplifying these broken narratives is simply not responsible leadership."" Trump's '51st state' comment was nothing but a joke, LeBlanc says Liberals aware of RCMP numbers needed to boost border security, opposition parties push for a plan Since Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5, Poilievre has accused Trudeau of being too weak to defend Canadian interests. He has also taken aim at the prime minister's handling of immigration and for pushing a consumer carbon tax and proposed cap on oil and gas emissions, which he says make the country less competitive for industry and businesses. Trudeau has for more than a year lagged Poilievre in public opinion polls, as Canadians express a desire for change and anxiety over the cost of living and housing prices. Leaving Tuesday's meeting with Trudeau, Poilievre struck a more muted tone, telling reporters he told the prime minister that Conservatives could be counted on to make the case that American tariffs would not only invite retaliatory tariffs while hurting American consumers. ""This is a president, an incoming president, who was elected on the promise to make to make America richer. These tariffs would make America poorer. They would raise energy prices when he promised that he would cut them in half, they would kill American jobs and drive up American cost of living,"" Poilievre told reporters. ""Those are arguments that I intend to make to anyone in a position of authority who will listen to them between now and January 20th and I think it should be easy to make those arguments, and easy to convince the Americans, even Mr. Trump's most nationalist supporters, that this is bad for them and bad for America."" Trump will be sworn into office on Jan.20. Poilievre's office has not yet responded to a query as to whether the Conservative leader intends to speak to any American leaders or other U.S. contacts to caution them against imposing tariffs on Canadian goods. Since Trump's re-election, Trudeau's Liberals have been trying to revive what they called their ""Team Canada"" approach from Trump's first term in office, where opposition leaders and premiers put aside their political differences to present a united front to the U.S. administration, as the countries, along with Mexico, renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement. Speaking after Tuesday's meeting and without divulging details, federal New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Poilievre of being unwilling to put aside his differences, even when behind closed doors. ""For him, he was still trying to score political points even when there's no cameras,"" Singh said. May put in another way. She said while Poilievre was not ""aggressive"" in his disagreement, ""there was clearly different tone from Mr. Poilievre."" Asked whether she felt the Conservative leader was trying to score political points, she said: ""Absolutely."" ""We're trying to pull together as 'Team Canada,' but I guess Mr. Poilievre can't help himself from trying to say in a private meeting the things that he objects to about government policy."" May said the opposition party leaders listened for most of the meeting, then asked some questions and had a discussion. Besides Trudeau, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was also present, as was Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc. Trudeau also cautioned the party leaders about what happens when incorrect information circulates in the U.S., May said. ""We certainly all were reminded that false information getting into the U.S sticks there forever,"" she said. ""The prime minister reminded us of how many Americans still think the terrorists from 9/11 came into the U.S. from Canada.

"Poilievre, Trump make Trudeau look like a leader",2024.0,"I'm glad Justin Trudeau managed to get face to face with Donald Trump and make the case that Canada shouldn't be socked with tariffs that would send our economy into a recessionary spin. Obviously it's better to talk directly to the Great Khan in his stately Mar-a-Lago pleasure dome than to be left on the outside peeking in. If you're invited for dinner, of course you go, and you make the very best of it. On the face of it, it must mean something positive that Trump agreed to see the prime minister so quickly after dropping his tariff bombshell. Doesn't it? But let's not over-egg this particular pudding. Some are portraying it as a ""coup"" by Trudeau and his team, but it was hardly that. The atmosphere, we're told, was ""warm and cordial."" For evidence that the president-elect bears Canada no ill will we are offered the fact that he let his guests pick some of the musical selections played through the dining room speakers. Well, OK then. And consider the sheer oddness of the event. Who gets a government leader to fly all the way to Florida but leaves him wondering till the last minute whether you'll actually see him (as per reporting in the Globe and Mail)? Who holds the dinner in the middle of a crowded (though gaudy) dining hall surrounded by paying club members? Who serves meat loaf, for heaven's sake? Take a close look of that now-famous photo of Trump, Trudeau et al at table. Just to the right of Trump, at the table behind them, there's a kid sticking his thumbs in his ears and making funny faces at the camera. This is a high-stakes summit meeting where existential issues for Canada's economy are being hashed out? You might as well debate the fate of the world at TGI Fridays. And the square-jawed guy on the other side of Trump, two seats away from Trudeau? That's Mike Waltz, the incoming president's nominee as national security adviser. A few months ago he tweeted out video of Pierre Poilievre trashing the PM in Parliament and added this choice remark: ""This guy is going to send Trudeau packing in 2025 (finally) and start digging Canada out of the progressive mess it's in."" Big grins at the table, but that's the harsh reality facing Trudeau. He promised Trump that Canada will add drones, helicopters and more personnel to patrol our border with the U.S., but he flew home with no guarantees that any of that will head off the tariff threat. This is all rather humiliating, but what can you do? At least the federal government is leading on the tariff/Trump issue, unlike earlier last week when every premier was freelancing his or her own solution. Some of those were actually useful. (Alberta's Danielle Smith, for example, can play a valuable role as the only non-U.S. member of the Governors' Coalition for Energy Security, a dozen state governors working on energy issues.) There won't be a 2018-style ""Team Canada"" this time around. The political calculus is entirely different, with Trudeau much weaker and a federal election in the offing. But the Trudeau government is finally asserting some basic leadership; the premiers need to do their part by not panicking, at least not in public. Another person who could be helpful, but apparently won't, is Waltz's choice for Canadian prime minister, Poilievre himself. The Conservative leader, according to all the opinion polls, is essentially our PM-in-waiting. Wouldn't it be great if he seized this moment of national angst to show real leadership, even statesmanship, by putting the national interest above momentary party advantage? Instead, there he was on Sunday denouncing Trudeau behind a podium labelled ""Fix the Broken Border."" That's a slogan that echoes and amplifies Trump's misrepresentations, edging into lies, about the state of the Canada-U. S. border. Surely there are ways for Poilievre to criticize the government without handing Trump an even bigger stick with which to beat on this country. There are real issues at the border, but it isn't ""broken."" Unlike, unfortunately, Poilievre's judgment about where to draw the line between partisanship and patriotism.

The return of Trump has Poilievre talking about a crackdown beyond the U.S. border:   The Conservative Leader called for a crackdown on people coming to Canada by tightening visa requirements to make it harder to visit and setting a cap on the number of asylum-seekers,2024.0,"The election of Donald Trump has Pierre Poilievre talking about a crackdown, but it’s not just about security at the U.S. border.

It’s only in the last few months that Mr. Poilievre has ramped up criticism of the Liberal government’s failure to control a surge of temporary residents. Now, he’s talking about cracking down on “false refugees” and warning “our Canadian jobs are being taken.” “I think it is time for a cap. And it is time to get rid of all of the abuse,” Mr. Poilievre said in his press conference on Sunday. He added: “We need to shut off the flow of false refugee claims who are in no danger in their country of origin but are sneaking in either through our porous border or our weak visa system, and when they land here making a false claim.” That’s the kind of lexicon Mr. Poilievre had kept from his lips for a long time, and on an issue that wasn’t in the repertoire of attacks against the government in the Commons until November. Still, opinion polls had been finding increased discontent with immigration levels and politicians were hearing it at constituents’ doors. In Quebec, asylum-seekers crossing at Roxham Road each year were a hot political issue until Mr. Trudeau struck a border deal with the U.S. in March, 2023. The day after Mr. Trump was elected, Quebec Premier François Legault warned a new influx could be coming. There’s a lot to unpack in what Mr. Poilievre is saying about asylum-seekers, too. Asylum-seekers are not really a major land border issue since the 2023 deal that allows Canada to turn back asylum-seekers at the U.S. border – as long as that deal holds. And it is not at all clear what Mr. Poilievre means when he says he wants a cap on asylum-seekers. Does it mean a Conservative government would reject the claims of all those above a chosen number, and deport them? His spokesperson declined to say Monday. The “how” matters, at least if Mr. Poilievre’s talk about a cap is supposed to mean anything at all. If there is one thing Canadians should learn from decades of debate about asylum-seekers, it is that politicians’ proposals are usually a mirage unless they can explain how they’ll do it. That applies to Mr. Poilievre’s suggestion that Canada “cut of the flow of false refugees.” It’s not as though that thought never occurred to anyone before. But no one applies to come to Canada as an asylum-seeker. Often they come as visitors, so cutting off the flow means keeping out more visitors. As Mr. Poilievre pointed out, the Liberal government’s 2016 decision to lift visa requirements led to more asylum claims until visas were reimposed in February. There were thousands, the Conservative Leader said, whose claims were ultimately rejected, “but only after many years of us paying their bills and funding their legal cases.” But there is a trade-off with visas. It blunts tourism and trade. Foreign governments complain, and sometimes retaliate. What would Mr. Poilievre actually do if he becomes prime minister? It’s incredibly vague.
