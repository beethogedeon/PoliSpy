Singh says NDP will unlock public land for housing as part of fight for Quebec votes:   He also promised $1-billion over five years to acquire more public land for construction,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Monday in Montreal his party will unlock public land to build rent-controlled homes – an announcement that is part of a push to shore up support in a province that has been key to past electoral success for the party. Mr. Singh said a government under his watch would use suitable federal Crown land to build more than 100,000 rent-controlled homes in the next decade. He also promised $1-billion over five years to acquire more public land for construction. The announcement was held outdoors in front of public land where homes have not been built. The NDP is facing a considerable challenge electorally across the country and public opinion polls show it is struggling, including in Quebec. Some political observers believe that based on current levels of support, it could be difficult for the NDP to receive party status in the House of Commons, which requires 12 seats. In 2011 under then-leader Jack Layton, the New Democrats saw a historic breakthrough in Quebec that resulted in 59 seats in the House of Commons. It was fundamental to the party achieving official opposition status for the first and only time in history. After Mr. Layton’s death, Quebec MP Thomas Mulcair was named leader. But after disappointing 2015 election results, Mr. Mulcair was voted out of his leadership role by party supporters and the leadership race that ensued saw Mr. Singh named leader in 2017. This is now Mr. Singh’s third campaign and his team struggled in Quebec in 2019 and 2021. Currently, the party holds one seat in the province, which is held by Alexandre Boulerice in the riding of Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie. Mr. Boulerice said Monday he is confident New Democrats will be able to garner more support, adding the party pushed to see pharmacare and dental care coverage for Quebeckers. In the previous Parliament, the NDP kept the governing Liberals in power while working a co-operative arrangement, known as the supply-and-confidence agreement. Beginning in March, 2022, the New Democrats offered their support to the Liberals in the House of Commons in exchange for movement in key priority areas including pharmacare and dental care. Mr. Singh walked away from that agreement with the Liberals last September. ""Elections matter; campaigns matter,"" Mr. Boulerice said, adding he is confident there will be a large number of Quebec MPs after April 28 vote. Mr. Singh is headed to Toronto for a campaign event on Monday evening.

Singh vows NDP is not going away:   Party's campaign begins amid slump in support,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh opened the 2025 election campaign heading east to Montreal, diving into a region where his party has struggled in recent years, but once found historic success in the ""Orange Wave"" of another era. It was part of a defiant tone struck by Singh in his opening act of the campaign, as he refused to submit to the judgments of national polls and a political class that suggested his party was in big trouble. Pressed about polls suggesting support for his party is sliding, Singh said he loves playing the underdog. Asked if his New Democrats would prop up a Liberal minority government in the House of Commons again, he scoffed and insisted he is running to become prime minister. Then he went to Montreal, where the party will fight to keep its last remaining seat from the wave of 2011 - and where it hopes it can recapture a few more. ""I know that folks like Pierre Poilievre and Mark Carney would want nothing better than for the New Democrats to disappear, for us not to point out the fact that Mark Carney's first step was to bring in a tax cut for millionaires at a time when he's promising also, his plan is to cut services for people, and that Pierre Poilievre shows up to a factory where workers had just lost their job, and he proposes a tax cut for big business and nothing for those workers who lost their job,"" he said to reporters in Ottawa, before he embarked on his first trip of the campaign. ""I'm sure they would want nothing other than for us to disappear and not point out those things. But news to them, we're not going anywhere."" Yet Singh's first real whistle-stop on the campaign's first day, in Montreal, was a clear indication he is trying to secure support the NDP risks losing to the Liberals. There, Singh arrived to an enthusiastic but modestly sized crowd of around 100 people, mostly young volunteers on local campaigns, who cheered him on as he invoked the hopeful message of the late Jack Layton, who once led the NDP to triumph in Quebec. It was a short event: Singh gave a five-minute speech to supporters - who had more boos for his mentions of Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Poilievre than they did for Carney - shook hands with an array of people, and left within an hour. Monday, Singh will head to Toronto and tour Ontario in the coming days as the New Democrats try to run an efficient, targeted campaign with lessons learned from the Ontario NDP's recent provincial election campaign. In Montreal and Toronto, the NDP hopes to recapture the support of progressive voters who polls suggest are flocking to the Liberals in the face of threats to Canada from Trump. Earlier Sunday, Singh strolled into an Ottawa news conference at a hotel overlooking Parliament Hill to respond to the formal launch of the election campaign. Flanked by cheering party faithful and watched by some of his party's top organizers, Singh brandished the NDP's ""In It For You"" slogan and painted his party as the only one fighting for working Canadians. With a massive Canadian flag hung behind him and a view of the Peace Tower as a backdrop, Singh stressed he is running to be prime minister even as he faced questions about his party's slump in public support. Dressed in a black suit and a pink turban, the NDP leader offered some of his sharpest attacks yet on Carney and Poilievre, suggesting his two rivals are trying to make Canada more like the U.S and comparing the two options to choosing between ""a house with a leaky roof or a cracked foundation."" ""Donald Trump has come out and endorsed Mark Carney. Elon Musk has endorsed Pierre Poilievre,"" he said. ""I'm the only federal candidate that is 100 per cent not endorsed by the Donald Trump administration."" Illustrating his challenge as the underdog in the race, neither Carney nor Poilievre spent much time discussing the New Democrats during the opening day of the campaign.

NDP best positioned to champion Canadians through trade war: Singh,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says he is comfortable with being a political underdog but that his party is best positioned to advocate for Canadians through a trade war spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump. Mr. Singh began the NDP’s federal election campaign on Sunday at a hotel in downtown Ottawa. During a speech to supporters in the capital, he said Mr. Trump launched an illegal trade war that has resulted in the loss of jobs for Canadians and more expensive products. Canadians deserve a prime minister who will make decisions in their best interest, and that person is neither Liberal Leader Mark Carney nor Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, Mr. Singh said. “I’m seeing a country where there’s a lot of workers who are worried about losing their jobs,” he said. “I hear people worried about the cost of living getting more expensive.” The NDP is facing a considerable battle to build electoral support in this election campaign, as public-opinion polls in recent weeks have suggested a drop in support for the party. There is growing concern among political observers about whether the New Democrats will be able to maintain their official party status – which requires at least 12 MPs in the Commons – after the April 28 vote. When Mr. Singh was asked about his party’s fortunes on Sunday by journalists, he said: “We’re not going anywhere.” There are also questions, including among party loyalists, about whether the NDP will reap the political rewards of its supply-and-confidence agreement that saw the party work with the governing Liberals from March, 2022, until September, 2024, in exchange for progress in key priority areas, including pharamacare. Mr. Singh walked away from the agreement in the fall. Pharmacare legislation, which received royal assent in October, was the result of protracted negotiations between the Liberals and the New Democratic Party. It laid out the first phase of a pharmacare plan that described Ottawa’s plan to work with provinces and territories to provide universal, single-payer coverage for contraceptives and diabetes medications. Prior to the start of the campaign, pharmacare deals were reached with British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island to see the rollout of coverage in these areas. Mr. Singh said Sunday that he promised a child living with diabetes he would push to ensure he would not need to worry about the cost of medication, and now three provinces have agreements in place: “We made that happen,” he said. Despite questions about levels of NDP support at the outset of the campaign, the party said it is entering the race with “recordbreaking momentum.” It said in a statement released on the eve of the election call that its fundraising numbers were up 70 per cent in January and 131 per cent in February compared with the same time last year. It also said this is the first time in a decade the party will spend the maximum allowed under Elections Canada’s limits. Anne McGrath, a party stalwart who worked with the late NDP leader Jack Layton and who is serving as the current campaign’s spokesperson, said in an interview that during campaigns, parties are on a level playing field because all have the same spending limits. Ms. McGrath, when asked if the NDP will be thanked electorally for the supply-and-confidence agreement, said this is part of the work of the campaign. She said Canadians are worried about Mr. Trump, along with other issues including housing and the affordability of groceries. This is Mr. Singh’s third federal campaign and he has far more experience as a party leader than Mr. Carney and Mr. Poilievre. After the vote in fall 2021, the NDP won 25 seats and was the fourth placed party in the House of Commons – a disappointing outcome for supporters. Mr. Singh is not willing to entertain the prospect of entering into another co-operative arrangement with a political party should there be a minority government after the vote. “This is Day 1 of the election campaign. I’m running to be prime minister of this country,” he said.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Kirkup, Kristy",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 24, 2025",Agreements; Trade disputes; Political campaigns; Canadians; Diabetes; Politics; Prime ministers,,2025-03-24,The Globe and Mail
'He's not our guy': Jagmeet Singh says Mark Carney is not 'in it' for regular folks,2025,"OTTAWA - On day one of the election campaign, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh launched a full-fledged attack against Liberal Leader Mark Carney, accusing him of working for wealthy investors and corporations, instead of regular Canadians. ""You deserve a prime minister you can trust to make decisions in your best interests, not to advance his personal wealth,"" said Singh, who was speaking in Ottawa with several local NDP candidates shortly after the writ dropped, on Sunday afternoon. ""He has spent his whole career serving the interests of billionaires, or shareholders and CEOs. He makes decisions that benefit people like him. He's not our guy,"" he added. The NDP is in a distant third position in the polls, with some showing single-digit numbers of support in parts of the country. But Singh and his team are determined to make the case in the following weeks that the New Democrats are the only option for progressive voters. Mark Carney kicks off election campaign in Ottawa with promise of a middle-class tax cut Poilievre launches his campaign promising to be 'respectful and firm' against Trump The NDP's slogan is ""In It For You,"" which the party hopes will showcase a clear contrast between them and the Liberal and Conservative parties in this election. NDP campaign director Jennifer Howard said in a recent briefing to media that she thinks the slogan ""indicates perfectly what people are looking for right now."" ""I think this is a fight about your interests, who is going to help you out, who is going to protect you, who is going to govern for you, versus who's going to govern for the wealthy millionaires and billionaires,"" said Howard. ""We're watching in real time what governing in the service of billionaires looks like in the United States right now, and that's not something we want to hear."" Carney, who was serving as Brookfield Asset Management's chair and head of transition investing until he decided to jump into politics in January, has been pressed by his political opponents to disclose any assets from Brookfield he put into his blind trust. Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks to media at Rideau Hall, where he asked the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and call an election, in Ottawa, Sunday. For Singh, that means linking him to decisions made to corporations linked to Brookfield - even though there is no proof that Carney was directly involved in those decisions. ""While families struggled to pay rent, he was helping banks and investors profit off the housing crisis. When people needed relief, he made sure corporations driving up prices kept breaking in profits. He cashed in while Canadians were struggling,"" said Singh. ""Now, he wants you to believe he'll fix the very things that made him and his friends richer. He won't fight for everyday people, because that's not who he is."" Singh did not mince words either for Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who is actively courting the votes of union workers that have been traditionally leaning New Democrat in the past. ""Pierre Poilievre talks about freedom, but he's only offering freedom for the ultra-rich, freedom for corporations to jack up your rent, freedom for billionaires to avoid paying taxes, freedom for big corporations to buy up our healthcare,"" said Singh. ""When times get tougher, he won't step in. He'll step aside. That's not leadership. That's not a plan that will build a Canada we can be proud of."" Poilievre launches his campaign promising to be 'respectful and firm' against Trump Singh also addressed voters who would be tempted to vote Liberal in a strategic move to stop Poilievre's Conservatives from forming government. ""But this is like being told you have to pick between a house with a leaky roof or a cracked foundation, one patched together with empty conservative slogans, the other rotting from the inside after years of Liberals protecting the most wealthy,"" he said. ""Those houses are not the same, but neither will hold up when the storm hits, because neither was built for you,"" he added. Singh's message? Only New Democrats can be trusted to look out for the people. ""Do not let the rich and powerful tell you that you deserve less. Do not let them convince you that in a time of crisis, you must sacrifice while they profit, because when the storm hits, they won't feel it,"" he said. ""We're not here to patch up a broken system for the next storm. We are here to rebuild it stronger, safer and fairer for everyone. I believe that's worth fighting for."" The NDP was in a supply-and-confidence agreement with the Liberals from March 2022 to September 2024 which helped Justin Trudeau's minority government stay in power, in exchange for implementing NDP priorities such as a national dental care program. That program is set to be fully implemented at the end of May, which will see millions of lower and medium-income Canadian households benefit from free dental care. With Carney now at the helm of the Liberal party, Singh told reporters on Sunday he had no interest in seeing the NDP becoming the Liberals' dance partner once again. ""I don't want to dance with them. I want to be the prime minister of this country.""

NDP Secrecy extended to its Sunshine Coast candidate; MLA Neill admits she also was kept in dark about deal signed with shishalh Nation,2025,"The New Democrats finally got around this week to providing a public information session for Sunshine Coast residents on the far-reaching agreement the government signed in secret with the shishalh Nation last August. The terms included payments of $104 million over five years, the transfer of six square kilometres of public land, and strengthened commitments to negotiate Aboriginal title and exclusive jurisdiction for the Indigenous nation. Thursday's online session began with an admission by Randene Neill, the new NDP MLA for Powell River-Sunshine Coast and the minister for water, land and resource stewardship. Neill answered a question her constituents have been asking since the terms were made public on Jan. 29, namely whether she was aware of the agreement before she was elected as MLA. ""I was not aware of the agreement when I was a candidate,"" said Neill, who won by a comfortable margin in October. She only learned the details when appointed to cabinet. Her ministry is one of those in charge of implementing the amended foundation agreement, as it is known. The belated discovery caused Neill some political embarrassment. She lives in Pender Harbour and last month the local residents' association called on her to account for the coverup and explain whether she'd known the terms in advance. During Thursday's information session, Neill acknowledged how the government-imposed secrecy on its dealings with the Indigenous nation had raised suspicions. ""There was mistrust in our community because of this plan,"" she told the online audience of 300. ""One reason why I got into politics included the feeling that you haven't been heard."" Neill was a reporter and anchor for Global TV - and a good one - before going into communications, then politics. Her candour had me thinking that she'd just gained a first-hand lesson about what it is really like to work for a secretive, controlling government. While she was kept in the dark, I have no doubt the premier's office knew all about the agreement. The fallout continued in a briefing from Tom McCarthy, deputy minister and the senior public servant for Indigenous relations and reconciliation. It is the lead ministry in negotiating the agreement and a partner with Neill's ministry in implementing the terms. McCarthy addressed another question that has dogged the government since the agreement was made public, namely why the terms were not disclosed before the election. ""We simply ran out of time,"" he said. The terms weren't ready for release before the election was underway. Premature release ""doesn't help anyone,"" said McCarthy. The 44-page text was signed by two NDP cabinet ministers and Indigenous leaders on Aug. 16. The legislature was dissolved and the government shifted into caretaker mode on Sept. 21. The New Democrats had five full weeks to add any finishing touches and release the terms to the public before seeking a mandate to govern for the next four years. Yet on Aug. 1 they did release the text of a related dock management plan for the Sunshine Coast. But that one was amended to address local concerns, thereby defusing a political controversy before the election. The Aug. 16 agreement could have reopened the controversy, hence the motivation for keeping it secret until after the votes were counted. The delay and coverup undermined the credibility of the agreement, a prospect that the deputy minister half-acknowledged in his followup comments on what happened. ""We should have found a way to get this out the door before the election,"" McCarthy admitted. ""We have to do better than that. I know we can do better and we will do better."" So the unelected public servant fronted the blame. But the handling of this agreement reminds me of last year's fiasco with proposed amendments to the Land Act. The David Eby government launched a ""public engagement"" on legislation that over time would have shifted public lands and resources to joint management with B.C.'s 200 First Nations. Somehow, they forgot to inform the public with even a basic news release, never mind the speeches, backgrounders and validators that were standard fare when the New Democrats wanted to draw attention to their election-year agenda. After the stealth makeover of the Land Act was reported here and elsewhere, the New Democrats were forced to abandon it. The controversy spilled over to the election campaign, leading Eby to vow that there would be no attempt to bring back the Land Act amendments after the election. The handling of the Sunshine Coast agreement suggests that he and his government have not entirely abandoned their secretive ways. Thursday's information session unfolded with multiple assurances that the public would be fully consulted and engaged on the next stages of implementation. A second session is set for March 31, with a link posted on the government website. ""Our main goal is to hear from you and answer your questions,"" said Neill. ""I hope that you do all participate."" I hear you minister. But a government that won't tell its own candidates what is unfolding in their own ridings has to be watched, and watched closely. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 22, 2025",Agreements; Elections; Political parties,,2025-03-22,The Vancouver Sun

"Calls grow for Carney disclosure; Campaign season Poilievre, singh demand that pm reveal potential conflicts",2025,"Opposition parties are not letting the story of Prime Minister Mark Carney's alleged conflicts of interest fade away. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Carney to do the ""right thing"" and disclose all his financial holdings so that Canadians ""can judge the conflicts he faces"" for themselves. ""He knows what he owns and there is nothing in the law that prevents him from publishing that information for all eyes to see if he has nothing to hide,"" Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que. ""We need a leader that is busy putting Canada first, not keeping an eye on investments that go against Canadian interests,"" he added. In Hamilton, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh echoed Poilievre's call for more accountability. ""Every other candidate for prime minister has to disclose very clearly their assets,"" Singh said. ""It is an understandable thing for Canadians to make a decision about who they want to govern the country to know: Do they have any conflict of interests? What are they? ""The fact that he's unwilling to do that shows a fear of accountability, and I want Canadians to pay attention to that."" The National Post asked Carney's office to address the Opposition's statements but did not receive a response by press time. Carney admitted this week, after repeated questions from the media, that he expects to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest related to his past work as chairman at Brookfield Asset Management, which describes itself on its website as ""a leading global investment firm with over $1 trillion of assets under management."" However, Carney said the process to determine what ethical ""screens"" he would be subject to is still in discussions with the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. The process can take months, so Canadians could likely be heading to the polls in just a few weeks not knowing if Carney is subject to any conflicts of interest. ""He admitted the other day, in a stunning flip-flop, that he has conflicts of interests that he will have to manage. But he won't tell us what those conflicts are,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects us to elect him without knowing the many millions of dollars of conflicts that will make it impossible for him to do his job."" Carney has said he went beyond what the Conflict of Interest Act demands, given that he put his assets in a blind trust as soon as he was elected Liberal leader. The law - which Poilievre helped adopt when he was in Stephen Harper's government - requires that public office holders divest their assets or put them in a blind trust within 120 days. The ethics commissioner is expected to publish a public summary of Carney's personal and financial information in that same time frame, but it could be available sooner. Poilievre is effectively asking Carney to go above and beyond what the law requires, given the unusual and quick succession of events that led to him becoming prime minister. When Carney was asked this week why he is not disclosing his assets proactively, he responded that it is a question that is for the ethics commissioner. Questions have been swirling on Bay Street about Carney's financial assets and his recent links to Brookfield. Until this past January, Carney was still serving as the company's chair and head of transition investing. He stepped down to run for Liberal leader. As a Brookfield employee, according to the corporation's annual report, he was entitled to stock options with a market value of more than $6.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. But most of his compensation, observers said, is likely stemming from the money he is entitled to as co-manager of three of Brookfield's biggest funds. Conservatives have remarked Carney could find himself in conflicts of interest for clean energy transition projects, for which he raised billions of dollars across the world. Brookfield and Carney's team have so far declined to say if he has put Brookfield assets in his blind trust, but recent comments suggest that is the case. Speaking in Iqaluit on Tuesday, Carney said in French ""it's clear"" he expects an ethics screen to apply to him if a government decision ""has a major impact for Brookfield."" Carney's finance minister declined to comment on whether Carney should publicly disclose his financial assets to reassure Canadians. ""I think he answered that question,"" said François-Philippe Champagne. Poilievre, meanwhile, was questioned on his party's controversial decision to not have media outlets travelling with him in the upcoming election, which is expected to be called Sunday. ""Local media will have the ability to ask questions. It will be refreshing to hear from local outlets and what they have to say about their local priorities,"" he said. Singh said the other leaders have shown they cannot take the heat from the media. ""Well, it's no surprise to me that Pierre Poilievre is afraid of some questions,"" he said.

Health coverage for international students absent from NDP's budget,2025,"International students who pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket for health-care insurance every year are disappointed to learn that promised relief isn’t included in Manitoba’s Budget 2025. The NDP campaigned on reinstating coverage for non-citizen scholars enrolled in post-secondary schools in the leadup to the 2023 election. “It felt like a final punch in the gut,” said Tomiris Kaliyeva, an international student from Kazakhstan, describing her reaction to Premier Wab Kinew’s latest budget — the government’s second of its first term — not making good on that pledge. Kaliyeva, president of the University of Winnipeg Students Association, has spent much of the last four years advocating for international students, who are being treated like “cash cows” while being made to feel increasingly unwelcome in Canada, she said. International tuition fees are roughly four times higher than those for domestic students at her university. The U of W students also pay about $740 for health-care coverage, which is on the lower end of plans at local campuses, every year. Following a recent meeting with government officials and Thursday’s budget release, Kaliyeva said she’s given up hope that future cohorts of international students will be able to visit a doctor at no cost. The province has neither provided UWSA with reassurance nor a timeline to follow through on the 2023 promise to reinstate coverage, she noted. Manitoba Health hasn’t covered the tab for students’ emergency hospital visits and other medical bills since 2018. The Progressive Conservatives, under the leadership of then-premier Brian Pallister, estimated the policy change would save the province $3.1 million annually (about $3.8 million in 2025). “Health care is a basic human right. Even though they didn’t include us in this budget, we will keep pushing and raising awareness for the need for everyone to get health care,” said Patricia Ahonon, a member of Healthcare for All Manitoba. It is unjust for any resident who pays taxes to be excluded from receiving free medical services, said Ahonon, a PhD student at the University of Manitoba who is a citizen of both the west African nation of Benin and the United States. Despite living and working in Winnipeg, the mother of two said she’s had to drive south of the border so her children can get treatment. She pays for private insurance through U of M, but it does not cover her kids. U of M’s health-care plan for international students totals $1,104 for 12 months, from Sept. 1 to Aug. 31. International students at Red River College Polytechnic are automatically charged $840 per year for an emergency health plan. Expansion packages cost more. Advanced Education Minister Renée Cable said the province’s priority is fixing health care and increasing access to post-secondary programs, and that’s reflected in Budget 2025. “We want all students to be able to focus on their studies without worrying about how they will access care,” Cable said in a statement Friday. The minister indicated her office is working with students and administrators to “explore options” to find the best solution after the Tories cut coverage. The province has topped up its general student aid program by $25 million, per the new budget. Kaliyeva, who is nearing the end of her presidential term at UWSA, is uncertain about her future in Manitoba. “Most students feel like they don’t have a tomorrow here,” she said, noting the federal government’s caps on international enrolment have heightened anxiety levels. “The climate around immigration is very hostile right now and no (international student) feels welcome anymore.” maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 22, 2025",Foreign students; Health care,,2025-03-22,Winnipeg Free Press
B.C. NDP government secrecy extended to its own Sunshine Coast candidate,2025,"VICTORIA - The New Democrats finally got around this week to providing a public information session for Sunshine Coast residents on the far-reaching agreement the government signed in secret with the shishalh Nation last August. The terms included payments of $104 million over five years, the transfer of six square kilometres of public land, and strengthened commitments to negotiate aboriginal title and exclusive jurisdiction for the Indigenous nation. Thursday's online session began with an admission by Randene Neill, the new NDP MLA for Powell River-Sunshine Coast and the minister for water, land and resource stewardship. Neill answered a question her constituents have been asking since the terms were made public on Jan. 29, namely whether she was aware of the agreement before she was elected as MLA. ""I was not aware of the agreement when I was a candidate,"" said Neill, who won by a comfortable margin in October. She only learned the details when appointed to cabinet. Her ministry is one of those in charge of implementing the amended foundation agreement, as it is known. The belated discovery caused Neill some political embarrassment. She lives in Pender Harbour and last month the local residents' association called on her to account for the coverup and explain whether she'd known the terms in advance. During Thursday's information session, Neill acknowledged how the government-imposed secrecy on its dealings with the Indigenous nation had raised suspicions. ""There was mistrust in our community because of this plan,"" she told the online audience of 300. ""One reason why I got into politics included the feeling that you haven't been heard."" Neill was a reporter and anchor for Global TV - and a good one - before going into communications, then politics. Her candor had me thinking that she'd just gained a first-hand lesson about what it is really like to work for a secretive, controlling government. While she was kept in the dark, I have no doubt the premier's office knew all about the agreement. The fallout continued in a briefing from Tom McCarthy, deputy minister and the senior public servant for Indigenous relations and reconciliation. It is the lead ministry in negotiating the agreement and a partner with Neill's ministry in implementing the terms. McCarthy addressed another question that has dogged the government since the agreement was made public, namely why the terms were not disclosed before the election. ""We simply ran out of time,"" he said. The terms weren't ready for release before the election was underway. Premature release ""doesn't help anyone,"" said McCarthy. The 44-page text was signed by two NDP cabinet ministers and Indigenous leaders on Aug. 16. The legislature was dissolved and the government shifted into caretaker mode on Sept. 21. The New Democrats had five full weeks to add any finishing touches and release the terms to the public before seeking a mandate to govern for the next four years. Yet on Aug. 1 they did release the text of a related dock management plan for the Sunshine Coast. But that one was amended to address local concerns, thereby defusing a political controversy before the election. The Aug. 16 agreement could have reopened the controversy, hence the motivation for keeping it secret until after the votes were counted. The delay and coverup undermined the credibility of the agreement, a prospect that the deputy minister half acknowledged in his follow-up comments on what happened. ""We should have found a way to get this out the door before the election,"" McCarthy admitted. ""We have to do better than that. I know we can do better and we will do better."" So the unelected public servant fronted the blame. But the handling of this agreement reminds me of last year's fiasco with proposed amendments to the Land Act. The David Eby government launched a ""public engagement"" on legislation that over time would have shifted public lands and resources to joint management with B.C.'s 200 First Nations. Somehow, they forgot to inform the public with even a basic news release, never mind the speeches, backgrounders and validators that were standard fare when the New Democrats wanted to draw attention to their election-year agenda. After the stealth makeover of the Land Act was reported here and elsewhere, the New Democrats were forced to abandon it. The controversy spilled over to the election campaign, leading Eby to vow that there would be no attempt to bring back the Land Act amendments after the election. The handling of the Sunshine Coast agreement suggests that he and his government have not entirely abandoned their secretive ways. Thursday's information session unfolded with multiple assurances that the public would be fully consulted and engaged on the next stages of implementation. A second session is set for March 31, with a link posted on the government website. ""Our main goal is to hear from you and answer your questions,"" said Neill. ""I hope that you do all participate."" I hear you minister. But a government that won't tell its own candidates what is unfolding in their own ridings, has to be watched, and watched closely. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related Scrapping carbon tax might make life more unaffordable, advocates say Donald Trump says U.S. doesn't need Canadian lumber.

"NDP blames trump for program's quick demise; But much-touted secondary suite incentive didn't entice many homeowners, builders",2025,"The New Democrats this week abandoned a program to help homeowners develop secondary suites, less than a year after announcing it with much fanfare and a hefty $120 million in forgivable loans. When Premier David Eby launched the secondary suite incentive program at a homebuilding centre in the provincial capital last May 2, he boasted it would add ""thousands of affordable rentals over three years."" Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon, also in attendance that day, said it was just a beginning. ""This is a pilot,"" he said. ""We're going to see how it rolls out and if it needs to be expanded, then I'll be knocking on the minister of finance's door."" From the outset, industry sources doubted the New Democrats could accomplish the hoped for 3,000 units over three years. The government offer to cover 50 per cent of the cost of a home renovation with a forgivable loan of up to $40,000 came with strings attached. The biggest was that homeowners had to guarantee they would rent the finished place at below market rates for five years. One Victoria builder estimated that construction of a self-contained suite in a typical home could cost more than $100,000 and maybe as much as $200,000. It would leave the homeowner with a sizable loan to pay off under the province's belowmarket-rate rent cap of $1,400 a month, said Amity Construction's Dusty Delain. ""Even after the five years when the government says well, you are forgiven that $40,000, the homeowner is out of pocket,"" Delain told Cindy E. Harnett of the Victoria Times Colonist. Also weighing in was the owner of an existing rental property. He said cost recovery would be further constrained by the NDP's 3.5 per cent cap on annual rent increases. ""My property taxes went up almost eight per cent, my insurance premium went up almost 25 per cent, and trades and services companies are charging about 10 per cent more than last year,"" he wrote. ""Thanks for the offer, Premier Eby. I'll pass."" Other would-be applicants may have been discouraged by Home Suite Home, the NDP government's cutely named 58-page guide on how to develop and manage secondary suites. The checklist alone ran to seven sobering pages. Skepticism about the NDP's chances of success were borne out this week when the government confessed that the take-up for the first year fell well short of the 1,000 target. Only 200 units had qualified for the province's loans with another 50 in the works. On that note, Kahlon announced further applications would be cut off on March 30, a mere 10 months after last year's head-in-the-clouds launch by he and the premier. True to form, the New Democrats took no responsibility for the failure. ""We face uncertain economic conditions and an unpredictable tariff situation with the U.S.,"" said Kahlon in a news release, falling back on the NDP's blame Donald Trump explanation for any and all troubles. Still, the housing minister gave away more than he intended about NDP policy-making when he told Alec Lazenby of Postmedia: ""I think we have to reassess programs that we'd like to have, compared to programs we need absolutely right now."" The preference for what we'd like to have over what we absolutely need goes a long way to explain how Eby squandered the $6 billion surplus he inherited from John Horgan and ended up with an $11 billion (and counting) deficit. Kahlon also blamed the federal government for one-upping the province's $40,000 loan offer with an $80,000 loan package of its own. ""We already are hearing that program is a little more appealing to many folks that are in this space than the one that we have,"" Kahlon conceded. Heaven help the taxpayers in a country where ""progressive"" federal and provincial governments compete on the same policy turf with their vote-buying schemes. One who expressed Ono surprise at the failure of the NDP's version of the secondary suite bailout was David Hutniak, CEO of Landlord B.C. The requirement that the new secondary suites or laneway houses be rented below market for at least five years made the program a non-starter for many of his members. He cited other NDP policies that discouraged British Columbians from becoming landlords. ""Rent caps, the emotional and financial stress associated with ending tenancies where renters are abusive and destructive, and out-of-control expenses (insurance, utilities, property taxes) all conspire to discourage folks from remaining or becoming landlords,"" Hutniak said. Useful observations. Those comments would have been even more instructive this time last year, when Hutniak allowed the New Democrats to quote him in their news release as predicting success for the loan program. ""This initiative by the province will encourage homeowners with underutilized space to create additional units of badly needed rental housing."" As for the New Democrats, they show no sign of learning lessons from their failure to read the market. Kahlon announced that the $80 million remaining in Years 2 and 3 of the secondary suites loan fund would be diverted elsewhere in the NDP's debt-laden portfolio of housing programs. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 21, 2025",Lessors; Rents; Cost recovery; Rentals; Homeowners; Property taxes,,2025-03-21,The Vancouver Sun
"Calls Grow for Carney Disclosure; Campaign Season Poilievre, Singh demand PM reveal potential conflicts",2025,"OTTAWA . Opposition parties are not letting the story of Prime Minister Mark Carney's alleged conflicts of interest fade away. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Carney to do the ""right thing"" and disclose all his financial holdings so that Canadians ""can judge the conflicts he faces"" for themselves. ""He knows what he owns and there is nothing in the law that prevents him from publishing that information for all eyes to see if he has nothing to hide,"" Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que. ""We need a leader that is busy putting Canada first, not keeping an eye on investments that go against Canadian interests,"" he added. In Hamilton, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh echoed Poilievre's call for more accountability. ""Every other candidate for prime minister has to disclose very clearly their assets,"" Singh said. ""It is an understandable thing for Canadians to make a decision about who they want to govern the country to know: Do they have any conflict of interests? What are they? ""The fact that he's unwilling to do that shows a fear of accountability, and I want Canadians to pay attention to that."" The National Post asked Carney's office to address the Opposition's statements but did not receive a response by press time. Carney admitted this week, after repeated questions from the media, that he expects to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest related to his past work as chairman at Brookfield Asset Management, which describes itself on its website as ""a leading global investment firm with over $1 trillion of assets under management."" However, Carney said the process to determine what ethical ""screens"" he would be subject to is still in discussions with the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. The process can take months, so Canadians could likely be heading to the polls in just a few weeks not knowing if Carney is subject to any conflicts of interest. ""He admitted the other day, in a stunning flip flop, that he has conflicts of interests that he will have to manage. But he won't tell us what those conflicts are,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects us to elect him without knowing the many millions of dollars of conflicts that will make it impossible for him to do his job."" Carney has said he went beyond what the Conflict of Interest Act demands, given that he put his assets in a blind trust as soon as he was elected Liberal leader. The law - which Poilievre helped adopt when he was in Stephen Harper's government - requires that public office holders divest their assets or put them in a blind trust within 120 days. The ethics commissioner is expected to publish a public summary of Carney's personal and financial information in that same time frame, but it could be available sooner. Poilievre is effectively asking Carney to go above and beyond what the law requires, given the unusual and quick succession of events that led to him becoming prime minister. When Carney was asked this week why he is not disclosing his assets proactively, he responded that it is a question that is for the ethics commissioner. Questions have been swirling on Bay Street about Carney's financial assets and his recent links to Brookfield. Until this past January, Carney was still serving as the company's chair and head of transition investing. He stepped down to run for Liberal leader. As a Brookfield employee, according to the corporation's annual report, he was entitled to stock options with a market value of more than $6.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. But most of his compensation, observers said, is likely stemming from the money he is entitled to as co-manager of three of Brookfield's biggest funds. Conservatives have remarked Carney could find himself in conflicts of interest for clean energy transition projects, for which he raised billions of dollars across the world. Brookfield and Carney's team have so far declined to say if he has put Brookfield assets in his blind trust, but recent comments suggest that is the case. Speaking in Iqaluit on Tuesday, Carney said in French ""it's clear"" he expects an ethics screen to apply to him if a government decision ""has a major impact for Brookfield."" Carney's finance minister declined to comment on whether Carney should publicly disclose his financial assets to reassure Canadians. ""I think he answered that question,"" said François-Philippe Champagne. Poilievre, meanwhile, was questioned on his party's controversial decision to not have media outlets travelling with him in the upcoming election, which is expected to be called Sunday. ""Local media will have the ability to ask questions. It will be refreshing to hear from local outlets and what they have to say about their local priorities,"" he said. Singh said the other leaders have shown they cannot take the heat from the media. ""Well, it's no surprise to me that Pierre Poilievre is afraid of some questions."" ""I'm sorry to say I think Mark Carney is showing that as well.""

"NDP assesses election result:   Caucus gathers for first time since vote, charts course ahead",2025,"The NDP plans to focus on health care, housing and issues impacting the North - but amid the cheers from caucus members at their first in-person meeting since the Feb. 27 election were concerns about why the party won fewer seats and a lower share of the vote. Leader Marit Stiles, who addressed her 27-member caucus at Queen's Park on Thursday, noted the party has MPPs from ""every region of the province - from the northwest to the southwest to border communities in Niagara and Windsor, from the rich farmland of Timiskaming to the bustle of Bay Street ... We also bring a diversity of experiences."" After welcoming three new MPPs - Alexa Gilmore (Parkdale-High Park), Robin Lennox (Hamilton Centre) and Catherine McKenney (Ottawa Centre) - Stiles said the caucus is ""going to get started on mapping out our plan for the next weeks and months and, yes, years ahead."" ""We're ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work because the stakes couldn't be higher right now,"" she said, adding that with ongoing economic threats from the U.S. the province will need to ""tariff-proof"" the economy. Dave Clark, the NDP's campaign director, told the Star in an interview that the party is now examining the election results ""to try and understand a bit more about what happened."" ""No one - no one's satisfied with coming second,"" he said, noting the party nonetheless defied polls, fending off the Liberals and remaining the Official Opposition, but failing to capture seats it had hoped to snatch from the governing Progressive Conservatives. ""It was a very different election than anyone has seen for a while, and lots of factors that made it hard to cut through, hard to plan ahead, hard to build the kind of campaign we would in normal circumstances"" he said of the snap election call that came a year and a half early this winter. ""What you've seen is the consequence of a few cycles where we really have put a lot of work into strengthening our incumbent seats, making sure that we have a really strong base to build,"" Clark said. However, he added, ""we built our campaign with the idea of having a strong core in those seats and then looking to build out and grow, into particularly PC-held seats. We didn't make gains, and that was a disappointment for us."" Clark also said strategic voting squeezed the party in some places, and ""whenever we're trying to think of strategy for campaigns, it's how to counteract this, because it's a tactic that we see from the Liberals in election after election, and it certainly had an impact."" The party had high hopes for a win in Sault Ste. Marie, where the PC incumbent decided not to run again, and amid much controversy in the riding after the local health clinic de-rostered some 10,000 patients, leaving them without a primary caregiver. Clark said talk of tariffs took over, however, ""so some of the issues that had been top of mind for people - and would typically be top of mind for the provincial election - were competing with other things."" In the 2018 election, the NDP garnered almost two million votes, and won 40 seats with 34 per cent of the popular vote. In 2022, 31 New Democrats were elected to Queen's Park as votes dropped to 1.2 million or 24 per cent of the popular vote. In February, the party saw its support drop to about 932,000 ballots, taking just 18.5 per cent of the popular vote, and it lost Toronto-St. Paul's to the Liberals. The NDP also failed to hold Algoma-Manitoulin after turfing incumbent Michael Mantha from caucus, and lost Hamilton Mountain after incumbent Monique Taylor decided to run federally. The PCs picked up both of those ridings. The party ""is not under any illusions"" about the results, Clark added. There was ""significant growth"" in 2018 under then-leader Andrea Horwath that led to the party's highest support in recent times, he said, but where it landed in February ""is not where anyone wants to be. We want to be forming government and winning."" Clark also said Ontarians need more time to get to know Stiles, who became NDP leader just two years ago. ""We saw her favourability really shoot up during the campaign. A lot more people know who she is, and we need to keep that going,"" Clark added.

NDP unveils battle-ready budget:   Province prepared to spend $1B in trade war plan,2025,"The NDP government’s second budget aims to soften the blow of U.S. and Chinese tariffs with contingency plans and a record $3.7 billion in capital spending intended to spur economic growth and create jobs in the face of uncertainty. But the cost of “Trump-proofing” Manitoba’s economy could result in a whopping $1.9 billion deficit, the provincial budget released Thursday said. Finance Minister Adrien Sala said the province’s defence plan in the face of a trade war is to launch a $3.7 billion capital spending program — the largest ever — to spur economic growth and create jobs in the face of uncertainty. “This budget meets the moment that Manitoba and our country is in right now,” Sala told reporters Thursday. “We didn’t start this fight, but we are not backing down. We are building up our province. We are Trump-proofing our economy.” The 2025 fiscal blueprint prepared two plans — one without tariffs and one if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes sweeping 25 per cent tariffs on April 2. The document includes a forecast “baseline” deficit of $794 million that could increase to nearly $1.9 billion in response to U.S. and Chinese tariffs. While Sala hopes Trump cancels the proposed tariffs, the “contingency budget” is ready if the president presses ahead. A $1.1-billion tariff relief plan would include up to $200 million to help businesses, up to $100 million for farmers and $100 million for families. It includes $85 million to train workers or students. The province already announced payroll and retail sales tax deferrals for businesses. The budget doesn’t come close to “meeting the moment,” said Progressive Conservative finance critic Lauren Stone. “What this tells me is we are headed into an economic recession and there is still no tax relief for Manitobans or businesses in the immediate term,” she said after Sala tabled the budget. It included increasing the payroll tax exemption threshold from $2.25 million to $2.5 million starting Jan. 1, 2026, and raising the reduced-rate threshold. That would benefit an estimated 875 employers and would exempt close to 150 from having to pay the tax, the budget said. “Manitobans are feeling the pressures today,” Stone said. “Who knows if businesses are even going to be in place in a year from now?” the finance critic asked. “The government has talked a lot, promised a lot, but not actually pulled the trigger on what Manitobans need.” Manitoba’s newest retaliatory measures include removing Tesla vehicles — the manufacturer run by Trump ally Elon Musk — and Chinese-made vehicles from an electric vehicle rebate program. “It’s part of our government’s commitment to be ‘elbows up,’” said Sala, using the hockey analogy/trade war cry. The budget said U.S. tariffs, and retaliatory measures by Canada, would slash Manitoba incomes by $1,420 per capita and reduce the province’s GDP by up to $3.6 billion, or 3.8 per cent, in a “worst-case scenario” comparable to the 2009 recession. The NDP’s plan to counter the impact of tariffs includes multimillion-dollar infrastructure projects — many of which were previously announced initiatives. Sala said nearly 18,000 jobs will be created via large-scale projects, including the second phase of Winnipeg’s North End Water Pollution Control Centre, the Port of Churchill and Hudson Bay Rail Line, the Lake St. Martin and Lake Manitoba outlet channels, a new gold mine near Lynn Lake and a new airport for Wasagamack First Nation. “We are going to build, build, build over the next many years to make sure our economy keeps humming,” Sala said, listing funding for new schools and health-care facilities announced previously, including the centre that’s part of the Portage Place redevelopment. What Manitoba needs is a trade strategy, and that’s not in the budget, the PC finance critic said. “The cost of living and U.S. and Chinese tariffs are the No. 1 issue that Manitobans care about right now.” Stone said other provinces have come up with strong trade strategies, pointing to Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe announcing funding for a trade export program with international officers. “They’re making very strong investments in trade and looking at external markets other than the U.S., and we’re not seeing that in Manitoba today,” Stone said. Sala said the province’s economy is expected to grow at a steady pace and that the budget will return to balance by 2027-28, at the end of the government’s first term. Stone doesn’t see how that’s possible. “I’ll believe it when I see it. They are placing a lot of faith in federal transfers increasing this year.” The province is expecting a $639 million increase in federal transfers in 2025-26. Budget 2025 outlines $25.8 billion in spending, an increase of $1.7 billion from 2024 that is largely due to wage increases for health-care workers and capital projects. Revenue is expected to drop by $70 million, largely because of Manitoba Hydro’s drought-related losses. The province’s debt is expected to climb to $36.5 billion this year, with $2.3 billion allocated to service that debt. Its debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast at 36.9 per cent and would climb to 38 per cent if the province posts a $1.9 billion deficit. Four per cent of gas tax revenue will go toward a new One Manitoba Growth Revenue Fund to help municipalities build hockey rinks, playgrounds and community centres. The tax was cut to 12.5 cents a litre from 14 cents on Jan. 1, after it was suspended for all of 2024. The fund is part of $424.3 million in cash for municipalities, including $240.4 million for Winnipeg alone, which is an extra two per cent from 2024. chris.kitching@freepress.mb.ca carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Chris Kitching and Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Kitching, Chris; Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 21, 2025",Trade disputes; Provincial budget; Capital expenditures; Gross Domestic Product--GDP; Economic growth; Economic conditions; Budget deficits; Recessions; Contingency planning; Tariffs,,2025-03-21,Winnipeg Free Press
Key takeaways from NDP's budget,2025,"Budget 2025 offers several measures intended to keep a few bucks in Manitobans’ pockets amid the cost-of-living crunch and a brewing U.S.-Canada trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat of sweeping 25 per cent tariffs cast a shadow over the Manitoba government’s fiscal plan for 2025-26. The budget includes increases to some tax credits, efforts to cut health-care wait times and measures, within the province’s control, to advance bail “reform.” Here are 15 things to know about Budget 2025: Tax credit hikes The NDP government is increasing the homeowners affordability tax credit by $100 to $1,600 on school taxes in 2026, a move that will cost $5 million. A $1,500 credit in last year’s budget replaced the school tax rebate and education property tax credit. For renters, an income tax credit is rising to $625 from $575 in 2026, as part of efforts to eventually get it back to $700. A top-up for low-income seniors is increasing to $357 from $328. Security rebates Manitoba is introducing a new security equipment rebate for businesses and bringing back a $300 rebate for homeowners and tenants, after last year’s $2 million in funding was quickly snapped up. For residences, this year’s pool is also $2 million. The province will offer $10 million for the business security program, after the sector lobbied for help to offset costs associated with thefts and vandalism. More beds, health care grads The budget earmarks $47 million to add 97 fully-staffed beds to hospitals to reduce the strain on ERs and improve the flow of patients through the system. The breakdown is 60 beds in acute care, 10 in critical care and 27 in transitional care. Finance Minister Adrien Sala expects all of the beds to be in use this year. A $48.2-million plan to train more staff includes 176 new educational seats (16 for paramedics, 20 residency spots for doctors, 40 for lab and X-ray technicians and 100 for health-care aides) amid $770 million in new funding to recruit and retain front-line staff, the government said. The budget also includes $3 million for staffing a mobile MRI machine for northern Manitoba. It’s expected to be based in Thompson and ready to roll this spring. No more rebates for Teslas Manitoba’s rebate for eligible electric vehicle purchases will continue, but the province is trying to discourage sales of Teslas or Chinese-made vehicles in response to U.S. and Chinese tariffs. Tesla is run by billionaire Elon Musk, who is carrying out some of Trump’s bidding. Manitobans can receive $2,500 on a used EV or plug-in hybrid and $4,000 for a new EV or plug-in hybrid. The government has allocated almost $15 million for rebates this year. $10-a-day summer child care Manitoba is moving ahead with an expansion of $10-a-day child-care spaces to the summer months. Families with those spaces will save an extra $788 to bring their annual savings to $2,808. Budget 2025 promises 4,600 additional spaces over the next two years toward an overall goal of 23,000. Lowering breast cancer screening age More than $4 million has been budgeted to help lower the screening age for breast cancer to 40, with plans for more staff, equipment and mobile services. It is one of several women’s health measures in the budget. The morning-after pill will become free of charge. With federal help, $10 million will go to the Women’s Health Clinic, and $10 million will go to hormone replacement therapy to improve care for women in menopause and perimenopause. Bail “reform” Manitoba Justice initiatives include $3 million for 12 new Winnipeg police officers. The province said the officers will help “track down” people who violate bail conditions. Budget 2025 mentioned plans for a new unit that targets offenders “who pose a serious risk to community safety.” The government is setting aside $1.5 million to expand its ankle bracelet-monitoring program. New water bombers Manitoba is allocating an $80-million down payment on three Canadian-made water bombers to fight wildfires. A new “attack base” will be built in Thompson to better respond to fires in northern Manitoba. The province is spending $1.1 million on new weather, wildfire mapping and reporting systems to aid firefighting efforts. Payroll tax cut A payroll tax cut, starting Jan. 1, 2026, will save $8.5 million annually for eligible Manitoba businesses, the province said. Annual thresholds will be adjusted where businesses with payrolls at or under $2.5 million will be tax-exempt. The payroll threshold below which businesses pay a reduced effective rate will increase from $4.5 million to $5 million. That will make 875 businesses better off and 150 fully exempt from the payroll tax, the government said. Support for ag sector Depending on tariffs, a contingency plan would unlock up to $100 million in support for farmers and producers, the province said. Within the regular budget, eligible loan amounts for the young farmers rebate will rise from $300,000 to $400,000 and the maximum individual lifetime limit will jump from $30,000 to $40,000. Manitoba is looking for new markets and trading markets in response to U.S. and Chinese tariffs, which pose a threat to the sector, particularly canola farmers and pork producers. Reconciliation efforts The province’s fiscal plan contains efforts to advance reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples. They include more than $450,000 in grants for Indigenous organizations and community-based programs, and $4 million for the Indigenous economic development fund. For schools, a land-based curriculum is being developed, treaty education is being expanded and there are plans to train more language teachers and research successful language revitalization programs in other jurisdictions. More mental health workers Budget 2025 includes $3.8 million to hire 35 new mental health workers, including three dedicated to helping paramedics, firefighters and law enforcement, toward a goal of 100 hires over four years. The government said funds will help “enhance” staffing levels at Health Sciences Centre’s crisis response centre. Under a pilot program, a community-based crisis response team will work alongside an Indigenous-led mobile health-care clinic. Encampment strategy The province’s new “Your Way Home” strategy, which aims to move people from homeless encampments to housing with supports, is getting almost $73.5 million this year. The strategy focuses on an estimated 700 people who live in encampments. It includes $16 million to convert a downtown building into transitional housing units for 118 people. Funds for safer drug site The budget allocates $1.3 million to Shared Health to contract the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre to operate Canada’s first Indigenous-led supervised consumption site. A building on the Disraeli Freeway in Point Douglas is being eyed for the site. The proposal requires the approval of Health Canada, which is reviewing an application submitted in November. Free park entry Entry into provincial parks will be free for a year. The province is budgeting $18 million to increase capital funding for eight more yurt and comfort camping sites and upgrades to campgrounds, facilities and trails. Improvements will be made at several sites, including Hecla, Birds Hill, Big Whiteshell and Winnipeg Beach. chris.kitching@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Chris Kitching","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Kitching, Chris",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 21, 2025",Workforce planning; Native peoples; Hormone replacement therapy; Womens health; Mental health care; Funding; Reconciliation; Crisis intervention; Tariffs; Rebates; Paramedics; Payroll taxes; Cost control; Budgets; Medical screening; Tax cuts; Tax credits; Breast cancer,,2025-03-21,Winnipeg Free Press
"Saskatchewan Party won't condemn Trump, but agrees with NDP that Canada won't be 51st state",2025,"An emergency motion brought forward by the Opposition was stripped of any condemnation of U.S. President Donald Trump by the governing Saskatchewan Party. NDP Leader Carla Beck introduced the motion during Thursday's sitting of the legislature, which read ""The Assembly condemns the Trump administration for proposing the annexation of Canada"" and tariffs on Canadian goods. It also stated the Government of Canada should not add export taxes or limit exports of Saskatchewan's natural resources. The motion was passed but not before it was significantly amended by Premier Scott Moe. His amendment included the following points: Canada will never be the 51st state, the Government of Saskatchewan is aligned with other provinces against tariffs, there are efforts being made by the government to increase procurement from Saskatchewan-based employers, there is support for targeted tariffs from the federal government but the province does not support export tariffs, the government is continuing to work with other leaders to remove tariffs, it supports infrastructure projects like rail and pipelines, and the government is increasing trade to other countries ""through international trade missions and trade offices"" while also calling for the removal of the federal carbon tax ""on everything for everyone."" Moe's amendment was approved 31-25 and the emergency motion passed unanimously. ""I honestly am at a loss as to why this government removed all references to Donald Trump from their motion,"" Beck said after question period, adding that many people in Saskatchewan want to hear a formal condemnation of Trump, by name, for his actions and rhetoric. ""This is a threat that continues to be repeated by the president of the United States,"" she said. ""We should name who it is that is threatening our country."" While his amendment was far lengthier than the original motion, Moe was adamant that people want action, not words, in the face of a multi-front trade war. He also said the motion illustrates a plan that his government has been formulating to fight U.S. tariffs and questioned what an explicit condemnation of Trump would accomplish. Moe said politicians at all levels need to ""dial back the rhetoric,"" although he did declare from the floor of the assembly that ""Canada will never be a 51st state."" ""Any comments in that realm are not only condemned by me, (but also) the majority if not all Canadians and many, many Americans as well,"" he added. The NDP voted for the motion as amended because, ""for the most part,"" it included things the party has asked for. While the motion passed, an attempt by the NDP to wear Team Canada hockey jerseys to question period wasn't successful. Opposition house leader Nicole Sarauer said the Speaker asked members not to wear them in the chamber. ""It wasn't what we expected,"" said Beck, who argued it wasn't a ""controversial"" move.

B.C. NDP finds Trump a convenient excuse for ditching its flawed programs,2025,"VICTORIA - The New Democrats this week abandoned a program to help homeowners develop secondary suites, less than a year after announcing it with much fanfare and a hefty $120 million in forgivable loans. When Premier David Eby launched the secondary-suite incentive program at a home-building centre in the provincial capital last May 2, he boasted it would add ""thousands of affordable rentals over three years."" Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon, also in attendance that day, said it was just a beginning. ""This is a pilot,"" he said. ""We're going to see how it rolls out and if it needs to be expanded, then I'll be knocking on the minister of finance's door."" From the outset, industry sources doubted the New Democrats could accomplish the hoped-for 3,000 units over three years. The government offer to cover 50 per cent of the cost of a home renovation with a forgivable loan of up to $40,000 came with strings attached. The biggest was that homeowners had to guarantee they would rent the finished place at below market rates for five years. One Victoria builder estimated that construction of a self-contained suite in a typical home could cost well over $100,000 and maybe as much as $200,000. It would leave the homeowner with a sizeable loan to pay off under the province's below-market-rate rent cap of $1,400 a month, said Amity Construction's Dusty Delain. ""Even after the five years when the government says well, you are forgiven that $40,000, the homeowner is out of pocket,"" Delain told Cindy E. Harnett of the Victoria Times Colonist. Also weighing in was the owner of an existing rental property. He said cost recovery would be further constrained by the NDP's 3.5 per cent cap on annual rent increases. ""My property taxes went up almost eight per cent, my insurance premium went up almost 25 per cent, and trades and services companies are charging about 10 per cent more than last year,"" he wrote. ""Thanks for the offer, Premier Eby. I'll pass."" Other would-be applicants may have been discouraged by Home Suite Home, the NDP government's cutely named 58-page guide on how to develop and manage secondary suites. The checklist alone ran to seven sobering pages. Skepticism about the NDP's chances of success were borne out this week when the government confessed that the takeup for the first year fell well short of the 1,000 target. Only 200 units had qualified for the province's loans with another 50 in the works. On that note, Kahlon announced further applications would be cut off on March 30, a mere 10 months after last year's head-in-the-clouds launch by he and the premier. True to form, the New Democrats took no responsibility for the failure. ""We face uncertain economic conditions and an unpredictable tariff situation with the U.S., said Kahlon in a news release, falling back on the NDP's ""Blame Donald Trump"" explanation for any and all troubles. Still, the housing minister gave away more than he intended about NDP policymaking when he told Alec Lazenby of Postmedia: ""I think we have to reassess programs that we'd like to have, compared to programs we need absolutely right now."" The preference for ""what we'd like to have"" over ""what we absolutely need"" goes a long way to explain how David Eby squandered the $6 billion surplus he inherited from John Horgan and ended up with an $11 billion (and counting) deficit. Kahlon also blamed the federal government for one-upping the province's $40,000 loan offer with an $80,000 loan package of its own. ""We already are hearing that program is a little more appealing to many folks that are in this space than the one that we have,"" Kahlon conceded. Heaven help the taxpayers in a country where ""progressive"" federal and provincial governments compete on the same policy turf with their vote-buying schemes. One who expressed no surprise at the failure of the NDP's version of the secondary suite bailout was David Hutniak, CEO of Landlord B.C. The requirement that the new secondary suites or laneway houses be rented below market for at least five years made the program a ""non-starter"" for many of his members. He cited other NDP policies that discouraged British Columbians from becoming landlords. ""Rent caps, the emotional and financial stress associated with ending tenancies where renters are abusive and destructive, and out-of-control expenses (insurance, utilities, property taxes) all conspire to discourage folks from remaining or becoming landlords,"" Hutniak said. Useful observations. Those comments would have been even more instructive this time last year, when Hutniak allowed the New Democrats to quote him in their news release as predicting success for the loan program: ""This initiative by the province will encourage homeowners with under-utilized space to create additional units of badly needed rental housing."" As for the New Democrats, they show no sign of learning lessons from their failure to read the market. Kahlon announced that the $80 million remaining in years 2 and 3 of the secondary suites loan fund would be diverted elsewhere in the NDP's debt-laden portfolio of housing programs. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related Victoria trampling on Utilities Commission's independence, again Take on Alaska and you will lose, Republican senator warns B.C. premier B.C.

"Poilievre, Singh call on Carney to publicly disclose assets, possible conflicts",2025,"OTTAWA - Opposition parties are not letting the story of Prime Minister Mark Carney's alleged conflicts of interest fade away. On Thursday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Carney to do the ""right thing"" and disclose all his financial holdings so that Canadians ""can judge the conflicts he faces"" for themselves. ""He knows what he owns and there is nothing in the law that prevents him from publishing that information for all eyes to see if he has nothing to hide,"" Poilievre said in Jonquière, Que. ""We need a leader that is busy putting Canada first, not keeping an eye on investments that go against Canadian interests,"" he added. In Hamilton, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh echoed Poilievre's call for more accountability. ""Every other candidate for prime minister has to disclose very clearly their assets,"" Singh said. ""It is an understandable thing for Canadians to make a decision about who they want to govern the country to know: Do they have any conflict of interests? What are they? ""The fact that he's unwilling to do that shows a fear of accountability, and I want Canadians to pay attention to that."" The National Post has asked Carney's office to address the Opposition's statements and is awaiting a response. Carney admitted this week, after repeated questions from the media, that he expects to recuse himself from potential conflicts of interest related to his past work as chairman at Brookfield Asset Management, which describes itself on its website as ""a leading global investment firm with over $1 trillion of assets under management."" However, Carney said the process to determine what ethical ""screens"" he would be subject to is still in discussions with the office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner. Bay Street insiders question Carney's 'placebo' blind trust as Brookfield ties come under scrutiny 'Look inside yourself': Carney gets snippy at reporter when pressed on conflicts of interest The process can take months, so Canadians could likely be heading to the polls in just a few weeks not knowing if Carney is subject to any conflicts of interest. ""He admitted the other day, in a stunning flip flop, that he has conflicts of interests that he will have to manage. But he won't tell us what those conflicts are,"" said Poilievre. ""He expects us to elect him without knowing the many millions of dollars of conflicts that will make it impossible for him to do his job."" Carney has said he went beyond what the Conflict of Interest Act demands, given that he put his assets in a blind trust as soon as he was elected Liberal leader. The law - which Poilievre helped adopt when he was in Stephen Harper's government - requires that public office holders divest their assets or put them in a blind trust within 120 days. The ethics commissioner is expected to publish a public summary of Carney's personal and financial information in that same timeframe, but it could be available sooner. Poilievre is effectively asking Carney to go above and beyond what the law requires, given the unusual and quick succession of events that led to him becoming prime minister. When Carney was asked this week why he is not disclosing his assets proactively, he responded that it is a question that is for the ethics commissioner. Questions have been swirling on Bay Street about Carney's financial assets and his recent links to Brookfield. Until this past January, Carney was still serving as the company's chair and head of transition investing. He stepped down to run for Liberal leader. As a Brookfield employee, according to the corporation's annual report, he was entitled to stock options with a market value of more than $6.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. But most of his compensation, observers said, is likely stemming from the money he is entitled to as co-manager of three of Brookfield's biggest funds. Conservatives have remarked Carney could find himself in conflicts of interest for clean energy transition projects, for which he raised billions of dollars across the world. Brookfield and Carney's team have so far declined to say if he has put Brookfield assets in his blind trust, but recent comments suggest that is the case. Speaking in Iqaluit on Tuesday, Carney said in French ""it's clear"" he expects an ethics screen to apply to him if a government decision ""has a major impact for Brookfield."" Carney's finance minister declined to comment on whether Carney should publicly disclose his financial assets to reassure Canadians. ""I think he answered that question,"" said François-Philippe Champagne. Poilievre, meanwhile, was questioned on his party's controversial decision to not have media outlets travelling with him in the upcoming election, which is expected to be called Sunday. ""Local media will have the ability to ask questions. It will be refreshing to hear from local outlets and what they have to say about their local priorities,"" he said. Singh said the other leaders have shown they cannot take the heat from the media. ""Well, it's no surprise to me that Pierre Poilievre is afraid of some questions."" ""I'm sorry to say I think Mark Carney is showing that as well.""

NDP scraps provincial park fees for a year:   Tariff cushions included in coming budget,2025,"Manitobans bracing for fallout from U.S. tariffs will be able to get away from it all — for free — at a provincial park. Entry to provincial parks will be waived for one year, starting April 1. The measure is included in the Manitoba budget, which will be unveiled today. “We live in a beautiful province with lakes, trails and wild spaces perfect for hunting, fishing and camping with friends and family,” says a snippet from Budget 2025 that was provided to the Free Press . “As Manitobans and Canadians choose to spend their vacation dollars and time here at home, we are making parks entry free for one year while we transition out of the parks reservation contract with a Texas firm started under the previous government and find a Canadian vendor.” When the first round of U.S. tariffs were about to hit on Feb. 4, Premier Wab Kinew singled out Manitoba’s “terrible contract” with Aspira, an outdoor recreation software company headquartered in Dallas. “Shouldn’t we be paying a Manitoba company to enjoy Manitoba?” Kinew asked reporters at a news conference minutes before the Trump administration postponed 25 per cent tariffs for 30 days. The contract is set to expire in April, with an option to extend it for two consecutive one-year terms. The Progressive Conservative government of Brian Pallister hired Aspira in April 2019 to launch virtual retail sales of park passes and fishing and hunting licences as of 2020. An administrative fee of $4.50 per transaction was introduced in exchange for the convenience of booking online. Since then, more than $7 million has gone stateside. Before Aspira was hired, licences and permits were sold in-person at local retail outlets. Provincial parks will be free to enter but campsite fees will be charged. A Canadian firm will handle the transactions. Finance Minister Adrien Sala said Manitoba’s fiscal blueprint for the 2025-26 fiscal year, meanwhile, will combat tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. “That budget will respond to the threats that Donald Trump is creating for our economy and for our sovereignty,” Sala said at Canada West Boots. On Wednesday, he followed the budget-eve tradition in which the finance minister buys a new pair of shoes. In this case, it was steel-toed work boots he gave to five trades students from Tec Voc High School. “We’re going to be building a lot of projects here in our province and putting people to work and creating great jobs here in Manitoba,” Sala said. A plan he referred to as “Building One Manitoba” aims to create a resilient and more sustainable economy by adding jobs and giving all families a chance to get ahead and succeed, Sala said. “That’s really important in light of the threats we face from the south of us,” the minister said. On March 12, 25 per cent tariffs were imposed on aluminum and steel. Levies of 25 per cent on most other goods and 10 per cent on energy from Canada are expected to take effect on April 2, after Trump paused the tariffs he had imposed on March 4. Manitoba’s counter-measures include deferring payroll and retail sales taxes for three months, pulling U.S. booze from Liquor Mart shelves and looking at how the province may use Manitoba hydroelectricity and critical mineral exports to the U.S. as “leverage” in the fight with the much larger opponent south of the border. Kinew has said Manitoba may take more actions. He hasn’t indicated how much counter-measures may cost, or how much his government is willing to borrow to shore up the economy. Sala said Wednesday the budget will include supports for businesses and farmers affected by U.S. tariffs as well as those imposed by China, which is slapping a 100 per cent levy on Canadian canola starting Thursday, Manitoba’s budget day. In the middle of an escalating and unpredictable trade war with Trump, Manitoba has prepared two budgets — one that accounts for the impact of the U.S. tariffs and one without. “You’ll see a contingency tariff budget along with the main budget,” the finance minister said. Manitobans will see how the province is prepared for whatever lies ahead, Kinew said Tuesday at an unrelated event. “You’ll see our plan, assuming the rest of 2025 going into 2026 goes well, and then you’ve got the contingency in case we need to step up with even more supports for the economy and for business,” the premier said. “We’re going to try and show that transparency, so that you’ll be able to see both scenarios: ‘here’s what the books would look like if Trump wasn’t up to what he’s up to each and every day’ and then ‘here’s the contingency plans that we have in place to support our economy and support our jobs’,” Kinew said. The NDP government is up against a $1.3-billion deficit, which is the highest during non-pandemic times, and economic uncertainty as it promises to resolve health care and homeless issues. Still, it’s standing by its pledge to balance the books during its first term in government. “We’re still committed to balancing budget by 2027, by the end of this mandate,” Sala said Wednesday. carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 20, 2025",Parks & recreation areas; Retail sales; Tariffs,,2025-03-20,Winnipeg Free Press
Too much over-reach by NDP government; Letters to the Editor,2025,"I find it ironic that Premier David Eby's rationale for Bill 7 legislation is that it allows him to move quickly to prevent harm to the B.C. economy. I would argue that Eby has caused more harm to the B.C. economy than any premier in modern history. Bill 7 is just another insidious power grab, couched in protectionist language. We are already feeling the effects of provincial over-reach with Bills 44, 46 and 47, which have spawned the loss of property rights, dismantling of heritage protections, erosion of tree canopies and biodiversity and no commensurate infrastructure to support the unfettered development that has been foisted on our cities.

"NDP hangs on to Transcona seat:   Educator follows in footsteps of her mentor, late MLA Nello Altomare",2025,"Voters in Transcona have chosen another New Democratic educator to fill the legislature seat of the late Nello Altomare. Shannon Corbett, 53, vice-principal of Transcona Collegiate Institute, will represent the constituency held by Altomare, the education minister and retired school principal, until he died Jan. 14. “You had a candidate who brought that Transcona blue-collar work ethic,” Premier Wab Kinew said at her victory party at Boston Pizza on Regent Avenue. Her background helped at the doorstep when they were campaigning, he said. “So many people we talked to are like, ‘Oh, you taught my nephew, you taught my grandkids, you taught my neighbour.’ “It’s just amazing to have another educator on the team who’s able to bring that knowledge of people just by hearing their last name, where they fit into the Transcona family,” the premier said. Corbett garnered 3,616 votes to beat Progressive Conservative candidate Shawn Nason, 56, a former Winnipeg city councillor, who had 1,569 votes. “I’m so excited to embark on this new phase of my life, to be a part of this NDP family,” Corbett told an exuberant crowd of supporters, including most of the NDP caucus. “I promise to advocate for the issues that matter to the people of Transcona,” said Corbett, who paid tribute to her mentor, Altomare. “I am so grateful for what he (did) for Transcona,” she said. “I’m grateful I had the time with him and his mentorship, and it just means the world to me.” She said his widow, Barb Altomare, was the first person they contacted with the news about her winning the seat for the NDP. “It’s been an amazing experience and we did it.” Liberal Brad Boudreau, 30, received 217 votes. Olympic speed skating medallist Susan Auch, 59, who ran as an independent, finished last with 208 votes. As is typical of a byelection, voter turnout was low. Only 5,631 voters of the 17,910 who were registered cast a ballot, equalling just 31.44 per cent turnout. In total, 2,418 voters, or 12 per cent, had voted in advance, Elections Manitoba reported. Voter turnout in the 2023 general election in Transcona was 51.4 per cent. In the 57-seat legislature, the NDP now has 34 seats, while the PCs hold 21 and there are two independents (Liberal leader Cindy Lamoureux and former NDP caucus member Mark Wasyliw). Altomare, who was first elected in 2019, won by more than 2,000 votes against his nearest rival, Titi Tijani of the PCs. University of Manitoba political studies Prof. Christopher Adams said in Transcona, the NDP used to be a shoo-in because the constituency is a traditional labour stronghold, but that’s changing. “The blue-collar nature of Transcona has been slowly shifting towards more of a suburban profile,” said Adams. The average household has three family members and a median income of $88,000. While it’s home to the unionized CN Transcona Shops and factories such as NFI Group’s New Flyer, it’s also had new housing developments spring up with families looking for lower taxes and more affordable living. Adams said that’s who Nason and the Tories were hoping to win over. “The PCs have been chipping away and that’s because of the suburban sprawl,” he said, pointing to Tory Blair Yakimoski winning the seat in 2016 when Brian Pallister’s PCs were swept into power. In the 2011 federal election, Conservative Lawrence Toet won the Elmwood-Transcona seat. Toet lost the seat in 2015 to the NDP’s Daniel Blaikie, but not by much. “That was the closest election call of Canada when Daniel Blaikie took it away by fewer than 60 votes,” Adams said. carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 19, 2025",Voters; Elections; Voter behavior; Suburban areas,,2025-03-19,Winnipeg Free Press
Tories hammer NDP for inflation jump,2025,"Manitoba has recorded the highest jump in the cost of living in Canada for the second consecutive month — a dubious distinction that sparked debate about affordability measures and rising school taxes in the legislature Tuesday. Statistics Canada data show the local consumer price index rose 3.5 per cent last month compared to February 2024. The national inflation rate grew 2.6 per cent. The Manitoba Bureau of Statistics attributed the change to a 23 per cent surge in gasoline prices since last winter. Travel tours, rent, mortgage interest costs and the purchase and operation of vehicles contributed to the uptick. The Opposition Tories took the opportunity in question period to accuse the NDP of making life more expensive. “A need for relief has never been greater. The economics horse is obviously in trouble,” Wayne Ewasko, interim leader of the Progressive Conservatives, told the house. Ewasko asked the NDP why it’s “driving inflation up” by allowing hefty property education tax hikes, among other fees. The Winnipeg School Division, the largest in Manitoba, approved a 13.7 per cent increase in local fees last week. The average inner-city homeowner with a property valued at $269,900 is expected to pay $214 more annually before the province’s new $1,500 rebate is applied. Remaining metro divisions also have double-digit increases, amounting to 10.4 per cent in St. James-Assiniboia, 16.6 per cent in Pembina Trails, 16.8 per cent in Seven Oaks, 14.4 per cent in Louis Riel and 14.4 per cent in River East Transcona. That’s according to a briefing shared with the City of Winnipeg’s executive policy committee, which PC finance critic Lauren Stone tabled in the legislature. “Many more steps to make your life more affordable will be coming in this year’s budget,” Premier Wab Kinew said, addressing the legislature via livestream. The budget for 2025-26 will be unveiled Thursday. Kinew also touted new legislation that aims to increase competition in the grocery sector by banning restrictive covenants — real estate controls that essentially allow businesses to draw a no-competition zone around their site — and his party’s track record on the provincial fuel tax. The NDP’s gas tax holiday, a key pillar in its 2023 election platform, was extended for all of 2024. The 14 cents-a-litre tax was permanently reduced to 12.5 cents as of Jan. 1. During the first month the tax was reinstated at a lower rate, Manitoba’s gas prices grew 25.9 per cent, year-over-year. While fuel prices grew slightly less in February, the all-items consumer price index rose even higher. It was 2.7 per cent in January compared to 3.5 per cent last month. “Manitoba had lower inflation on food purchased from stores than any of the provinces in the west, but we know that that’s not good enough,” Kinew noted during question period. This StatCan line item grew marginally more in Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C., which recorded respective increases of 3.5 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 3.5 per cent compared to Manitoba’s 3.4 per cent growth. maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 19, 2025",Gasoline prices; Consumer Price Index; Legislatures; Tax increases,,2025-03-19,Winnipeg Free Press
Mulcair: Carney vs. Poilievre - an election like no other,2025,"Canadians are barrelling toward an early election that Prime Minister Mark Carney will call within the next few days. All of the opposition parties had vowed to defeat the government at the first opportunity, so this election had become inevitable; there was no reason for the Liberals to wait to be defeated on a confidence motion. When you're a party of power, you like to decide things yourself - and the Liberals weren't going to wait to have their fate decided by their opponents. Across the land, there was a pent-up desire for change. It was reflected in a massive Conservative lead that had held until Justin Trudeau's departure. Mark Carney's triumph in the Liberal leadership race to replace Trudeau has, of course, rewritten the script. Will he be able to represent that change and pull off a monumental comeback win for the Liberals? We are about to go through a campaign the likes of which we've never seen: Liberals seeking a fourth mandate while trying to represent change - and Conservatives, stuck in opposition mode, appearing more and more like a flailing force. On the partisan front, the leaders of the two main parties couldn't be more different. In terms of expertise and experience, there's simply no comparing the two main opponents. Carney's professional resume is world class. He's been the governor of the Bank of Canada and was the first ""outsider"" to be the governor of the Bank of England. He's occupied top-level positions at the United Nations, on environment and climate, and in the private sector, in particular with trillion-dollar asset-management firm Brookfield. He has a tendency to speak in the reserved language of a central banker rather than the bold assertions of the seasoned politician, but that's part of the change. His competence helped steer Canada through the deep recession of 2008 and Britain through Brexit. He appears equipped to deal with the irascible blowhard in the White House. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is edgy and hardbitten in his politics and prickly in his dealings with journalists. At the same time, Poilievre's main edge is ... his edginess! He's a pugnacious debater, as he proved when he flattened Jean Charest in a flurry of punches during their leadership contest. His French is fluent and could prove an advantage. Poilievre's biggest challenge is his apparent inability to adapt. His visceral contempt for the Liberals in general and Trudeau in particular was evident in all of their dealings. He is a pit bull who would love to provoke a dogfight with Carney as well, but Canadians have had their fill of belligerence from U.S. President Donald Trump - and Poilievre seems tone deaf to that. Poilievre prosecuted Trudeau brilliantly and his attacks were well-honed and easy for the average Canadian to understand: there was a housing crisis; the country was broke, and the profligate spending had begun well before the pandemic; the cost of living was high and the carbon tax was hurting families. Poilievre vowed to ""axe the tax."" Now even that's been erased by Carney. Trudeau may be gone but Poilievre's contempt hasn't. It's just been redirected to Carney. The day after Carney won the leadership, Poileivre held a press conference filled with partisan and personal bile aimed at Carney. That was the exact wrong tone for a moment when Canadians have had their fill of aggressive posturing from south of the border. Like Trudeau, Poilievre is an excellent politician with little else on his resume. Carney is just the opposite, deeply experienced but untested as a politician. Canadians want change but they also want someone with the ability to help navigate us through these very uncertain times. Who that is will be the ballot question for many Canadians.

Pierre Poilievre won’t invite media on campaign plane in coming election:   The Liberals and NDP have sent invitations to media organizations offering places on campaign plane or buses for a fee,2025,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s team has decided that journalists will not be invited to travel on his campaign plane, marking a break from a long-standing practice. Historically, political parties charge media organizations a fee for a seat on the campaign plane, allowing them to cover all of the leader’s events. The start date of the next election has not yet been announced, but it is widely expected to begin within the next few days. Both the Liberal Party and the NDP have sent invitations to media organizations offering the traditional arrangements of places on the leader’s campaign plane or buses for a fee to cover costs. Jenni Byrne, the Conservative Party’s national campaign director, sent an update to media organizations Tuesday afternoon informing them that there will be no media contingent on a Conservative bus or plane, ""though we welcome and encourage participation at all public events."" Ms. Byrne said in the memo that travel costs have risen at the same time as the capacity for digital and remote access to public events has improved. She also pointed out that in recent years, some national media outlets opted to cover campaigns from their closest bureau rather than participating in the leader’s tour. ""We would like to assure you that this campaign will be one of the most accessible and transparent campaigns in recent memory. We have taken multiple steps to ensure that Canadian media will be able to share any public events, participate in events on the ground, and ask questions remotely and in-person,"" she wrote. Ms. Byrne said organizations will be given advance notice of event locations and full conferencing services, ""where an equitable balance at all press conferences between local and national media will be ensured."" The campaign says it will also offer a professional-grade video feed for broadcasters. In the 2021 federal election campaign, then-Conservative leader Erin O’Toole did not travel constantly, opting instead to spend a considerable amount of time holding events in an Ottawa studio. However, he had said the studio option was partly about being ready to respond to evolving restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a move away from campaign buses or planes for media at the provincial level. During this year’s Ontario election, none of the major parties offered a full media campaign bus or plane. Carleton University journalism professor emeritus Christopher Waddell, a former Ottawa bureau chief for both CBC News and The Globe and Mail, said he’s not surprised by the announcement. He said there are fewer media organizations that can afford seats on campaign tours. Prof. Waddell said the downside for the media is that they may not know about all of the leader’s events. He also said the Conservatives’ plan would make it easier for the party to decide who asks questions. ""There’s no question that if you do this, it gives the party doing it more control,"" he said.

Greens seek guardrails on NDP's emergency powers,2025,"The B.C. Greens said Friday they will push for amendments to legislation introduced by David Eby's NDP government this week to give the government sweeping emergency powers to respond to U.S. tariffs. Jeremy Valeriote, the Green MLA for West Vancouver-Sea to Sky, said he doesn't know exactly what those amendments will be, but the Greens will be ready to bring them forward when the legislature resumes after its twoweek spring break. ""I understand the government needs to be able to move quickly with this ever-changing, turbulent time, but we will want to make sure that there is the right guardrails in place,"" said Valeriote. ""If they want to be able to get this through, they should be amenable to amendments."" The Greens have two MLAs and have a formal agreement to support the NDP government, which has a one-seat majority. Valeriote said the amendments could include narrowing the broad scope of the powers the legislation provides over the economy and focusing them on U.S. tariffs. He said they also would like to see changes that bring more transparency, to give the legislature a look at changes and provide feedback, ""so these decisions are not being made in the dark."" He said the Greens would also like to talk about the timelines in the legislation, which gives Eby's government the broad powers until May 28, 2027. The Greens haven't said they would vote against the legislation, and the NDP could push legislation through without them with their 47 seats to 46 held by opposition partners - the 41 Conservatives, three Independents and two Greens. The Speaker, an NDP member, casts votes to break a tie. The legislation, under Bill 7, would give the NDP powers to reduce interprovincial trade barriers, put tolls on bridges and ferries, and unilaterally change any legislation relating to B.C.'s economy, interprovincial co-operation or challenges from the U.S. included under the bill. Exceptions include rules governing natural resource permits and any laws regarding engagement with First Nations on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. Although the government would be required to report on all changes to legislation and regulations made under the bill twice a year, in May and October, it will not be required to have those changes ratified by the legislature. This means the government will not have to have the legislature agree to the changes before implementing them. Eby has said the government needs to be able to respond quickly to the tariffs and annexation threats levelled by U.S. President Donald Trump. Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch, a Canadian organization that advocates for government accountability, said his reading of the legislation is that the provincial government would be able to change the law through regulation without going through the legislature. He said that he didn't believe the courts would uphold such a measure and expected it to be challenged. B.C. Conservative Leader John Rustad said Friday his party intends to find a way to stop the legislation, although he wouldn't say what his party has planned. ""Stay tuned,"" he said.

Stewart Prest, a political scientist and lecturer at the University of B.C., said a legal challenge would have to demonstrate the legislation was clearly running afoul of some kind of constitutional principle. Prest noted that in times of emergency and unusual situations, courts do give governments a measure of space to deal with those situations. However, the government does need to be careful that these powers aren't seen as being abused, added Prest.

"NDP eyes emergency powers as Trump's threats continue; Legislation 'very dangerous,' as it allows government to do as it pleases: Rustad",2025,"In a move the official Opposition says is a ""slippery slope,"" the NDP has introduced emergency legislation giving it broad powers to reduce interprovincial trade barriers, put tolls on bridges and ferries, and unilaterally change any legislation relating to B.C.'s economy. Premier David Eby told reporters in Victoria the government needs to be able to respond quickly to the tariffs and annexation threats levelled by U.S. President Donald Trump. ""One thing is clear for British Columbia, we can never leave ourselves again to be in the position of being at the whim of one person in the White House,"" said Eby. ""We have to move faster, and we have to be incredibly nimble to respond to the escalating situation."" To that end, he said the bill lays out provisions that would allow taxes on trucks moving goods to and from Alaska. These taxes will not be put in place immediately after the legislation passes but instead held in reserve. It also breaks down all barriers to goods produced in another province with no need for reciprocation. This in some ways goes farther than Nova Scotia's mutual recognition approach that allows goods to flow freely with other provinces that have similar legislation. The bill does leave some barriers in place, such as ICBC's monopoly on auto insurance. Conservative Leader John Rustad said that while he is supportive of the government's desire to move quickly, the breadth of the powers the legislation gives the NDP is troubling. ""There's no question that we need to be able to take steps. However, what I'm very concerned about is this bill actually enables the government to implement tolls and road fees anywhere in the province, including ferries, something that, quite frankly, I find very, very dangerous,"" said Rustad. ""The other thing is, this gives the government sweeping powers to basically do anything they want with no oversight. We need to make sure that any decisions that they make have the oversight of this legislature."" Rustad's concerns aren't shared by the business community, with both the Business Council of B.C. and the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade coming out strongly in support of the legislation. Laura Jones, CEO of the business council, said she likes that the bill doesn't require other provinces to pass similar legislation in order for B.C. to remove barriers on the flow of goods and would like to see that feature of the legislation become permanent instead of expiring in May 2027, as it's currently set to. As for the emergency powers, Jones said Canada currently finds itself in an ""unusual situation"" and that how the government uses them needs to be watched carefully. She said she doesn't want them extended past their current expiry date unless absolutely necessary. The conditions under which the province can use these emergency powers are extremely broad with all laws and regulations deemed to be related to B.C.'s economy, provincial co-operation or challenges from the U.S. included. Exceptions include natural resource permits and any laws regarding engagement with First Nations on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. Although the government would be required to report on all changes to legislation and regulations made under the bill twice a year, in May and October, it will not be required to have those changes ratified by the legislature.

"Greens, NDP government finalize agreement; Legislature",2025,"B.C.'s NDP government and the provincial Green caucus have signed the agreement that consolidates the New Democrats' hold on the provincial legislature where they have a one-seat majority. A statement from the NDP caucus says the final deal includes ""additional commitment"" to consult the Greens on U.S. tariff and trade actions as they affect housing, health care, transit, environment and social justice. The agreement says the parties' top shared priorities include the creation of ""tens of thousands"" of affordable non-market housing units and expanding key transit routes. Interim Green leader Jeremy Valeriote, who is part of a two-person caucus, said in a statement that the deal ensures ""a stable government"" that puts British Columbians ahead of ""political manoeuvring."" Premier David Eby says the finalization of the agreement means people can expect to see the legislature ""work together and make progress on the big challenges"" the province is facing. The basis of the deal was announced in December, committing the two Greens to providing confidence to Eby's New Democrats, who won 47 seats in B.C.'s 93-seat legislature. The official Opposition B.C.

NDP power-grab law is the most far-reaching since the War Measures Act,2025,"VICTORIA - Premier David Eby responded to the Trump tariff threat Thursday with legislation to allow the NDP cabinet to override all provincial laws, regulations, authorities and even the legislature itself. ""In extraordinary times we need extraordinary powers,"" Eby told reporters, referring to Bill 7, the Economic Stabilization (and) Tariff Response Act. He's right about the powers in the bill being extraordinary. In 41 years of covering B.C. governments, I've not seen a legislation as arbitrary and far-reaching this side of the federal War Measures Act. It would give the NDP cabinet the power to make regulations broadly ""supporting the economy of B.C. and Canada."" Which might well cover darn near anything that popped into the mind of Eby or his ministers. It also allows for regulations supporting all manner of measures to reduce trade barriers within Canada. Cabinet ministers can ""request"" regulatory authorities to amend their regulations in line with new objectives. Authorities that fail to do so within 60 days will be forced to comply. Other provisions would allow the cabinet to backdate orders to Jan. 20 of this year, when Donald Trump took office. And there's an open-ended clause that would allow the cabinet to ""make regulations respecting the collection or disclosure of information - including personal information - for the purposes of this act."" The cabinet is further empowered to sign orders ""addressing challenges"" or, even ""anticipated challenges"" arising from the actions of a foreign jurisdiction. Anticipated by whom? Eby was asked at one point. He referred the question to Attorney General Niki Sharma. ""When we designed the guardrails on the use of that power, we were looking at it in terms of anticipating when and what circumstances it would be used, in really unpredictable circumstances,"" she replied. ""So it gives us that scope and ability to step in in extraordinary times. We needed these extraordinary powers."" In other words, Eby, Sharma and their colleagues will use these powers as they see fit. As for the alleged guardrails, the legislation includes a half dozen or so override clauses. Each addresses potential clashes between cabinet orders issued under the Act and existing ""laws, regulations, authorities, directives, requirements, guidelines, programs, policies, administrative practices or any other procedure."" Each says much the same thing. In the event of a clash, the newly drafted cabinet order will prevail over the existing law, regulation and policy. The only limitations on cabinet's power are regarding the legislative obligation to consult and accommodate the interests of Indigenous people, which cannot be overridden. Nor can the cabinet waive the requirement ""to obtain a licence, permit or other authorization for, or the assessment or consideration of, the environmental effects of a project relating to a natural resource."" I was tempted to write that the new legislation will allow the NDP cabinet to ""trump"" most existing laws and regulations. For in confronting Trump's arbitrary exercise of power, Eby would give his own cabinet an unprecedented amount of legislative and regulatory leeway. Eby and Sharma also referred to the legislation as ""time limited."" Not all that much. It will be in effect until May 28, 2027, well into the third year of Eby's four-year term. Once the New Democrats use their legislative majority to enact the legislation this spring, they will not have to further consult the legislature until after the fact. Eby at one point claimed that the cabinet orders, issued under the Act, will be subject to ratification by the house. But ratification is not explicitly spelled out in any provision I could see. Nearing the end of the news conference Eby clarified this thinking around the sweeping powers that cabinet is preparing to exercise. ""The regulations need to be tabled in the legislature,"" he said, which is spelled out in the text of the bill. ""The government is governing with a very slim majority,"" he continued. ""At any time, members of the legislative assembly could decide that this was overreach."" If the house were to actually vote down a regulation or condemn the New Democrats for going too far, ""then the government would be into an election,"" said Eby. ""I would stand and tell British Columbians that these authorities, this bill, is to do exactly what I'm telling them today,"" the premier continued. ""It is to respond to nightmare scenarios that are eminently in the realm of the possible with this president. My guess would be that they support us being able to respond to natural disasters or to man-made disasters quickly and effectively and to ensure we have the authorities to do so. If we can anticipate a disaster coming, we darn well better be prepared for it. ""And that's what we're doing with this legislation,"" he said, framing Bill 7 as a stage setter for a future election, just six months after the last one. With that, Eby pretty much gave his game away. Up to now, he's been measured in his response to the Trump tariffs. But he's also begun musing about an opening for an early election. Not right away, but before this week's power grab expires two years from now. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related B.C. took a hit to get a new Columbia River treaty. Now Trump wants even more The B.C.

""We end up going down a slippery slope if we use the erratic, nonsensical, hostile behaviour of others to justify an erosion of our legislative protections.""

He pointed out that there is a sunset clause of May 2027, meaning the legislation isn't permanent, and that it simply gives the government more flexibility to respond, although he did acknowledge there should be more safeguards around when the government can use the legislation.

NDP gets pass on U.S. booze boycott; Letters to the Editor,2025,"It appears Valerie Middleton (March 6, Let's sell the booze already in stock) was writing prior to March 4 when Canada announced tariffs on a long list of U.S.A. products, including alcohol. When U.S.A. tariffs on Canadian products were first announced some weeks ago, several Canadian premiers, irrespective of political party, had the same 'huge brainwave' to immediately remove U.S.A. alcohol from all liquor outlets. As Premier Doug Ford said recently, U.S.A. alcohol will be put in storage and sold when tariffs are removed. It will not be poured down the drain. Removal of these products is currently the Canadian thing to do, along with avoiding buying anything made in the U.S.A. unless it's a case of last resort.

"NDP, Tories square off over big school board tax increases",2025,"Tory MLAs took the Kinew government to task during question period Wednesday over local school boards’ hefty tax hikes for next year. The River East Transcona School Division detailed plans to <a href=""https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2025/03/11/transcona-trustees-blame-inequitable-education-funding-propose-15-5-tax-hike"" target=""_blank"" title=""River East Transcona trustees blame inequitable education funding, propose 15.5% tax hike"">raise fees by 15.5 per cent</a> — which amounts to $277 more annually for an average homeowner — to balance its 2025-2026 budget on Monday. It’s the largest increase to be tabled by any board of trustees in Winnipeg in recent weeks. Opposition education critic Grant Jackson condemned the proposal that he said is unfair to hard-working families facing U.S. tariff threats and general affordability challenges. “Will the minister step in and provide additional funding to this school division so they can reduce this tax increase on hard-working families?” Jackson (Spruce Woods) asked Education Minister Tracy Schmidt during a heated debate in the house. “Or is she content with property owners and people who are struggling to pay their mortgage paying more to keep this government afloat?” Schmidt (Rossmere) replied that she was proud of the NDP’s latest school funding announcement amounting to a 3.4 per cent increase overall. She noted that figure is well above the 2024 inflation rate. Last year, the cost of living in Manitoba rose 1.1 per cent — the result of Premier Wab Kinew’s yearlong gas tax holiday. RETSD received a 6.7 per cent boost for the current school year and 3.4 per cent for next year, she said, calling those figures “a heck of a lot more than they got under the Tories, who did nothing but cut and underfund schools across Manitoba for 7 1/2 years.” (The 3.4 per cent figure takes into account both provincial and federal funding for school nutrition programs in its 42 schools.) Brianne Goertzen, who chairs the RETSD board’s finance committee, has said both a lack of provincial funding and inequitable formula are to blame for the rate hike in 2025-2026. “The NDP abandoned an equitable, fair funding model for school divisions in Manitoba. The result is Manitobans are paying more when they are already stretched,” PC finance critic Lauren Stone said during question period. Stone (Midland) tabled documents detailing an 11 per cent tax hike in the Seine River School Division and a 6.8 per cent increase in the Brandon School Division. In response, Finance Minister Adrien Sala touted the province’s above-inflation increase to school funding in 2025-2026 and new $1,500 flat school tax rebate. “The level of hypocrisy here is off the charts,” Sala (St. James) added. The former PC government delayed an overhaul of the education funding review that began in 2021 during the last election year. maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 13, 2025",Funding; Education; School boards; Tax increases,,2025-03-13,Winnipeg Free Press
"NDP Government winging it on carbon tax repeal; With feds not expected to recall Parliament before election, B.C. not sure how to proceed",2025,"The recent provincial budget said nothing about how the New Democrats will proceed with their election eve promise to phase out the carbon tax on B.C. consumers. Instead, the budget documents suggested it will be business as usual for the controversial tax, starting with the scheduled increase on April 1. ""Carbon tax revenue growth is expected to average 14.1 per cent annually over the next three years, reflecting assumed annual carbon tax increases and assumptions (about) purchase volumes,"" said the main report. However, all of this is expected to come to a halt, perhaps before the end of the month or soon afterwards. The B.C. version of the carbon tax is backstopped by the federal tax, which is itself on the way out. ""We would get rid of the carbon tax immediately, but there is a federal backstop carbon price that exists in law that requires us to maintain the carbon tax for now,"" Premier David Eby reminded reporters this week. ""When they remove that backstop through legislation, then we'll remove our carbon tax as well."" In the interim, staff in the Finance Ministry have been looking for a way of avoiding the almost 20 per cent increase scheduled for April 1, so far without any luck.

Elimination would entail legislation presumably, and Carney is expected to call a snap election before calling Parliament back into session. Ottawa is also looking for a workaround, according to federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault.

""But clearly, with what Mr. Carney said yesterday, this is something that I am looking into."" Even if Ottawa expedites repeal and B.C. follows suit straight away, it doesn't say anything about the effect of the phaseout on provincial finances. The province budgeted for carbon tax revenues of $3 billion this year, $3.5 billion next year and $3.8 billion the next year. The climate action tax credit for mainly low-income British Columbians is booked to return about $1 billion over each of the three years. So the New Democrats budgeted to collect $10 billion, return $3 billion, and keep the remaining $7 billion for other purposes. ""If Ottawa removes their requirement for the carbon tax, we will remove the carbon tax on British Columbians while ensuring that big polluters pay,"" according to Bailey. Her budget provided no details on how that would work. How much of the $3 billion in tax is paid by consumers? How much by ""big industrial polluters?"" How many of those big industrial polluters are also trade-dependent and having to compete in international markets? Will the government try to make up the loss of revenue from consumers by raising the tax on industry? Will B.C.'s relief from the carbon tax extend to farmers and small- and medium-sized businesses mentioned by Carney? Will the province completely eliminate the climate action tax credit? Or maintain it in part to offset higher charges from businesses having to pay more under the revised carbon tax regime? The B.C. Finance Ministry has not answered any of those questions. But it would appear the options are: 1) raiding the budget's $4 billion in unallocated contingency funds, 2) increasing the tax burden on industry, or 3) blowing a bigger hole in a budget that is already deeply in deficit. At one point this week, Eby appeared to be experiencing a bit of regret over the passing of the carbon tax.

"NDP Gleeful as B.C. Conservatives unravel; By not thoroughly vetting candidates prior to election, Rustad must take some blame",2025,"The day began with three former B.C. Conservative MLAs denouncing Opposition Leader John Rustad in terms that would have been over the top if directed at the NDP premier. Rustad was a ""coward"" and a ""bully,"" they charged. He was ""corrupt,"" lacking in integrity. ""John Rustad harboured a lynch mob,"" said John Kealy, MLA for Peace River North. ""He caved to the woke Liberals who have infiltrated his party,"" added Tara Armstrong, MLA for Kelowna-Lake Country-Coldstream. The two resigned from the Conservative caucus Friday in sympathy with Dallas Brodie, the Vancouver-Quilchena MLA ousted by Rustad earlier that day. Brodie set the stage two weeks ago with a single, provocative post on social media: that the number of bodies recovered at the site of the Kamloops residential school is ""zero."" Rustad asked her to take down the post, in recognition of some paramount truths: that more than 4,000 Indigenous children were taken away from their families, sent to residential schools and died there. That their remains were not returned to their families and that is why residential schools have a cemetery, where Indigenous children are buried. Brodie instead doubled down, stepping up her attacks on ""the powerful vested interests of the multibillion-dollar reconciliation industry."" She also went after her own party's house leader, A'a:liya Warbus, who she accused of being ""super angry"" and in league with the New Democrats. Finally, after viewing Brodie's inflammatory performance on a podcast last week, Rustad dumped her from the caucus. ""I believe strongly in free speech,"" said the Conservative leader. ""However, using your stature and platform as an MLA to mock testimony from victims alleging abuse, including child sex abuse, is where I draw the line."" Thus, the issue that triggered the extraordinary split in the Opposition: Not the NDP government's dismal financial record of debt and deficits. Not its failure to deliver on promises of public safety, access to hospital emergency rooms and affordable housing. Not even the issue that lately commands public attention from coast to coast - the Trump tariffs. Rather it was an MLA shouting from the internet equivalent of the rooftops that Indigenous people have yet to produce even one body at the site of the former residential school in their community. The righteousness, the lack of proportion and shame, is appalling. All three MLAs claim that their positions were justified by personal victories in the election. As opposed to having won in safely right-of-centre seats, where a household appliance would have a half-decent chance of sweeping to victory. One of the three, Kealy, appeared to have a brief attack of conscience on the weekend when he posted a ""bit of clarity"" on social media. ""I am not a racist. I am not homophobic,"" read a statement reminiscent of those retailers who feel compelled to put ""honest"" on their storefronts. ""I acknowledge the painful history of residential schools and the injustices faced by First Nations. I will never condone hate in any form."" Except toward the guy who led him and his colleagues to near victory last October, that is. Kealy and the other two were assigned desks at the far end of the legislature chamber from the Speaker. For now, they are known as ""the freedom caucus"" by their friends, ""the Trump trio"" by their critics. Before long they'll probably combine to obtain official party status in the house. They'd be the third party, while the Greens, with two MLAs, would be relegated to fourth. The remaining Conservatives were acting Monday like they were well rid of the three - and they may be right about that. As a starting issue for a new party, it is hard to think of a more obnoxious one than a call for Indigenous people to ""bring up the bodies."" As for the New Democrats, they cannot believe their good fortune. Just 12 days into the first session after the election, and already the Opposition is split. Must be some sort of record. Last week, Premier David Eby urged Rustad to deal with Brodie. ""A big tent that has space for racism is not a political tent, it is a circus tent,"" said Eby. ""And he's gotta kick the clown out of the tent."" The premier did not even attempt to conceal his glee in addressing the NDP's provincial council on the weekend. ""I have my phone on silent so if another Conservative caucus member leaves during my speech, just give me a little wave,"" he gloated. Monday, Eby did acknowledge that Rustad had done the right thing. ""It took him too long. But he did do the right thing,"" he said. Then added: ""John's still got some work to do if he wants to ensure that the extremist views in his party are addressed."" Rustad did bring this on himself by failing to thoroughly vet his candidates for provincial office.

Polling station doubles as venue for NDP fundraiser:   Accidental overlap above board: election body,2025,"An advanced polling station in Transcona doubled as the venue of an NDP fundraiser over the weekend, but Elections Manitoba says the accidental overlap was above board. For the second time in six months, Transcona residents were called to the polls on Saturday to cast early ballots in a March 18 byelection. Former education minister Nello Altomare, who had represented the provincial riding since 2019, died on Jan. 14. All Saints Ukrainian Orthodox Church opened its doors to voters to choose Altomare’s successor on Saturday, starting at 8 a.m. Later in the day, NDP supporters arrived at the place of worship at 1500 Day St. for a fundraising dinner in support of newly elected MP Leila Dance. “The NDP booking at a voting station was not in the spirit of keeping voting stations nonpartisan and we are continuing to pursue and rectify the matter with Elections Manitoba to ensure this oversight doesn’t happen again,” said Michele Halverson, chief executive officer of the PC Party of Manitoba. Mike Ambrose, director of communications and public information for Elections Manitoba, said his office worked with event organizers to ensure they respected all provincial legislation. “The church had inadvertently double-booked and we only found out about it after the voter information cards had already gone out,” Ambrose said. The Elections Act prohibits anyone from distributing political party pamphlets and materials within 50 metres of an entrance of a polling station during the voting period. It outlaws the posting of related signage within the same proximity and time frame. Ambrose said the two activities on Saturday took place more than 50 metres apart and NDP representatives agreed not to use any exterior signage with the party name, logo or anything of the sort. Their designated entrances were situated on opposite corners of the place of worship and Elections Manitoba had extra staff on site to help voters find the right door, he said. Christopher Adams, an adjunct professor in political studies at the University of Manitoba, called the situation “quite unusual,” although he said the overlap was minimal — about 2.5 hours — and is unlikely to impact voters or turnout. “There’s a lot of political noise going on and it’s hard for voters to be made aware of a byelection so I would say that’s really the (main challenge) right now,” said Adams, who lives in the constituency of Transcona. U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive orders and leadership contests both among the Liberal Party of Canada and PC Party of Manitoba have proven distracting, he said. At the same time, he suggested political volunteers may be experiencing fatigue as they’ve been repeatedly tapped to campaign in the Transcona area in recent months. The federal New Democrats did not provide comment Sunday. A spokesperson for the Manitoba NDP said the party was not involved in planning the fundraiser. “Our focus is on the people of Transcona and our positive vision to fix health care and make life more affordable,” they said in a statement. The party has nominated Shannon Corbett, a vice-principal at Transcona Collegiate, to secure the seat. Former city councillor Shawn Nason is running to represent the Progressive Conservatives. “My focus has been knocking on the doors, having volunteers out to help by the dozens and just meeting the residents of Transcona. That’s what I’ve been doing since I got the nomination,” Nason said Sunday. The Manitoba Liberal Party has endorsed policy adviser Brad Boudreau in the race. Olympian speed skater Susan Auch has mounted an independent campaign. The spokesman for Elections Manitoba said it can be difficult to find a suitable location available for eight days of advanced voting. “Churches are often a good solution. They’re in the community. They have availability,” Ambrose said, noting that his employer has relied on Transcona’s All Saints Ukrainian Orthodox Church in recent general elections. Parish president Len Matiowsky said the challenge for the church was that Elections Manitoba had tentatively booked a chunk of time, not knowing exactly when the writ would drop. Neither group could cancel because they’d both already printed and distributed materials with the date and venue on them, Matiowsky said, adding that the parish made last-minute adjustments to accommodate both parties. “We’re part of the community and we want to contribute, but it was challenging,” he said. Doors for the NDP dinner, which cost $150 for a regular ticket, inside a church hall opened at 5:30 p.m. The political party planned the International Women’s Day gala to honour Dance as the first woman elected to represent Elmwood-Transcona. Dance won the Sept. 17 race — which was called after Daniel Blaikie resigned to take an adviser role with Manitoba’s NDP government — by more than 1,100 votes, securing her party’s stronghold in east Winnipeg. There have been three political races in Transcona over the last 18 months, each of which Luciano Isaak has participated in. “Every vote counts,” the 22-year-old said. Isaak said he typically votes blue, regardless of the type of election. “I’m not a big Trudeau guy,” he said, before cementing his support for the Tories at an advanced poll on Sunday. “Things seem to be going in a worse direction, every day.” The state of health care and interprovincial trade barriers were top of mind for Brian Derkach as he voted early on Sunday afternoon. “The PCs seem quite incompetent and uncaring about the population and I can’t stand them so I’m going to vote for the party that’s not them,” Derkach said from the All Saints parking lot. Career teacher Kris Frederiksen said he, too, was voting for the NDP despite knowing little about the current candidate, owing to the quick timeline for the latest race. “We’re pretty stable and locked-in with our NDP government. There’s not a lot of controversy around that so I’m not hearing a lot of conversation (about this byelection),” added Frederiksen, who’s lived in Transcona for more than 20 years. Advanced voting is taking place daily at the church, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., through next Saturday. Eligible residents can also vote during those hours — except for Sundays, during which polls are only open from noon to 6 p.m. — at the Transcona Local Election Office at 100 Paquin Rd. until March 17. A total of 460 ballots were cast on Saturday, the first day of advanced voting. maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 10, 2025",Polls & surveys; Nominations; Local elections; Voters; Voter behavior; Political parties,Nom: Ukrainian Orthodox Church; NAICS: 813110,2025-03-10,Winnipeg Free Press
Second hitman sentenced in murder of former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik,2025,"The second of two hitmen who gunned down former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik in July 2022 was sentenced Friday to life in prison without any chance of parole for 20 years. Jose Lopez, 26, expressed remorse through his lawyer Alice Vo, who said her client had taken responsibility for his role in the targeted murder by pleading guilty. But just like fellow hitman Tanner Fox,who got the same sentence in January, Lopez did not tell the court who hired him, despite another plea from Malik's daughter-in-law. B.C. Supreme Court Justice Terence Schultes accepted a joint sentencing submission for the 20-year minimum term made by prosecutor Matthew Stacey and Vo. ""The degree of moral blameworthiness demonstrated by the extensive steps to prepare for and then escape from what was in effect, an execution of Mr. Malik, as well as the disturbing nature of that execution itself, unquestionably support the period of parole ineligibility that has been recommended,"" Schultes said. ""I'm satisfied it is a sensible and appropriate resolution of the charge, one that effectively balances the apparent strength of the Crown's case against the vagaries of proof at trial and the benefits of certainty to all those who have been affected by the offence."" Malik, 75, was shot to death outside his Surrey business at 8236 128th St. just before 9:30 a.m. on July 14, 2022. Twenty years ago this month, he was acquitted of all charges in the 1985 Air India bombing that left 329 dead. Malik's family and supporters packed Courtroom 102 at the New Westminster Law Courts. Also in attendance was Lopez's mother, who began weeping as Schultes read his sentence. Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, who is married to Malik's eldest son, Jaspreet, turned to Lopez during her address to the court and urged him to name those behind the murder plot. ""Mr. Lopez, we plead with you to reveal the names of the people who hired you. That is the only right thing to do,"" she said while also lamenting the loss of her beloved ""Daddy Ji."" She said Malik was admired for his charitable work and successful businesses. He was one of the founders of the Khalsa School and Khalsa Credit Union. ""The people who hired you thought they could erase my dad's legacy and his work. Too bad for them. We won't let that happen."" She turned several times to the prisoner's box to speak directly to the killer, who was dressed in a dark suit and white shirt. ""It has been hard for us not to have fear. We have been anxious and sometimes even scared. This fear and anxiety comes from not knowing who hired you,"" Dhaliwal said. Schultes summed up details from the agreed statement of facts entered when Lopez and Fox pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in October and cited again by Stacey on Friday. Lopez and Fox ""were hired and paid to commit the murder using a stolen vehicle that had had its licence plates changed."" ""They drove to Mr. Malik's business on 128th Street in Surrey on the morning of the offence date and waited for him to arrive to work. When he did so, they approached his vehicle and fired a total of seven shots at him at close range, causing his death,"" Schultes said. There were employees of Mr. Malik's business and of other businesses in the same complex outside at the time, and they fled in response to the shooting."" The two men escaped in the Honda CRV they had been driving, then burned the vehicle in a nearby laneway and drove off in an Infiniti they had left parked in the area. Police later searched residences linked to the two men and recovered a Puma backpack that contained masks and gloves with the DNA of both men on them, the two firearms used in the murder, plus ammunition magazines. At Lopez's New Westminster apartment, police found $16,485 in cash and his cellphone on which there was a video from July 16, 2022 that depicted a hand fanning out $100 bills onto a carpet. Fox's cellphone, seized at his Abbotsford home, also had a photograph taken the same day ""of a large amount of $100 bills,"" the agreed statement said. Schultes also said the victim impact statements read by Dhaliwal and Malik's daughter Kirat showed how much those close to Malik continue to suffer. ""They each movingly described Mr. Malik's integral role in their family unit, his significant contributions to his greater community, and the irreplaceable loss that his murder has caused in their family,"" he said. ""It is still clear that the impact of this offence on those left behind has been very severe."" The absence of information about who hired the hit men reflects a trend in B.C. where shooters in contract killings have been pleading guilty to lesser charges without providing any details about those paying to get people killed. The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team is still trying to find those who conspired to kill Malik, Sgt. Freda Fong said Friday. ""Investigators remain open to information anyone has about the person or persons involved in hiring the accused,"" she said. kbolan@postmedia.com X.com/kbolan Blueksy: @kimbolan.bsky.social Related Young hitman who killed Surrey businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik sentenced to life Guns, gloves and a getaway car: Revealing photos released in murder case of Surrey's Ripudaman Singh Malik New Westminster police investigating courtroom attack by Ripudaman Singh Malik killer",The Vancouver Sun (Online); Vancouver,Vancouver,"Bolan, Kim",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 7, 2025",Criminal sentences; Criminal investigations; Murders & murder attempts; Firearms,Nom: Air India; NAICS: 481111,2025-03-07,The Vancouver Sun
Second hitman sentenced in slaying of former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik,2025,"The second of two hitmen who gunned down former Air India suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik in July 2022 was sentenced Friday to life in prison without any chance of parole for 20 years. Jose Lopez, 26, expressed remorse through his lawyer Alice Vo, who said her client had taken responsibility for his role in the targeted murder by pleading guilty. But just like fellow hitman Tanner Fox,who got the same sentence in January, Lopez did not tell the court who hired him, despite another plea from Malik's daughter-in-law. B.C. Supreme Court Justice Terence Schultes accepted a joint sentencing submission for the 20-year minimum term made by prosecutor Matthew Stacey and Vo. ""The degree of moral blameworthiness demonstrated by the extensive steps to prepare for and then escape from what was in effect, an execution of Mr. Malik, as well as the disturbing nature of that execution itself, unquestionably support the period of parole ineligibility that has been recommended,"" Schultes said. ""I'm satisfied it is a sensible and appropriate resolution of the charge, one that effectively balances the apparent strength of the Crown's case against the vagaries of proof at trial and the benefits of certainty to all those who have been affected by the offence."" Malik, 75, was shot to death outside his Surrey business at 8236 128th St. just before 9:30 a.m. on July 14, 2022. Twenty years ago this month, he was acquitted of all charges in the 1985 Air India bombing that left 329 dead. Malik's family and supporters packed Courtroom 102 at the New Westminster Law Courts. Also in attendance was Lopez's mother, who began weeping as Schultes read his sentence. Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, who is married to Malik's eldest son Jaspreet, turned to Lopez during her address to the court and urged him to name those behind the murder plot. ""Mr. Lopez, we plead with you to reveal the names of the people who hired you. That is the only right thing to do."" she said while also lamenting the loss of her beloved ""Daddy Ji."" She said Malik was admired for his charitable work and successful businesses. He was one of the founders of the Khalsa School and Khalsa Credit Union. ""The people who hired you thought they could erase my dad's legacy and his work. Too bad for them. We won't let that happen."" She turned several times to the prisoner's box to speak directly to the killer, who was dressed in a dark suit and white shirt. ""It has been hard for us not to have fear. We have been anxious and sometimes even scared. This fear and anxiety comes from not knowing who hired you,"" Dhaliwal said. Schultes summed up details from the agreed statement of facts entered when Lopez and Fox pleaded guilty in October and cited again by Stacey Friday. Lopez and Fox ""were hired and paid to commit the murder using a stolen vehicle that had had its licence plates changed."" ""They drove to Mr. Malik's business on 128th Street in Surrey on the morning of the offence date and waited for him to arrive to work. When he did so, they approached his vehicle and fired a total of seven shots at him at close range, causing his death,"" Schultes said. There were employees of Mr. Malik's business and of other businesses in the same complex outside at the time, and they fled in response to the shooting."" The two men escaped in the Honda CRV they had been driving, then burned the vehicle in a nearby laneway and drove off in an Infiniti they had left parked in the area. Police later searched residences linked to the two men and recovered a Puma backpack that contained masks and gloves with the DNA of both men on them, the two firearms used in the murder, plus ammunition magazines. At Lopez's New Westminster apartment, police found $16,485 in cash and his cellphone on which there was a video from July 16, 2022 that depicted a hand fanning out $100 bills onto a carpet. Fox's cellphone, seized at his Abbotsford home, also had a photograph taken the same day ""of a large amount of $100 bills,"" the agreed statement said. Schultes also said the victim impact statements read by Dhaliwal and Malik's daughter Kirat showed how much those close to Malik continue to suffer. ""They each movingly described Mr. Malik's integral role in their family unit, his significant contributions to his greater community, and the irreplaceable loss that his murder has caused in their family,"" he said. ""It is still clear that the impact of this offence on those left behind has been very severe."" The absence of information about who hired the hit men reflects a trend in B.C. where shooters in contract killings have been pleading guilty to lesser charges without providing any details about those paying to get people killed. kbolan@postmedia.com x.com/kbolan Bluesky: @kimbolan.bsky.social Related Young hitman who killed Surrey businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik sentenced to life Guns, gloves and a getaway car: Revealing photos released in murder case of Surrey's Ripudaman Singh Malik New Westminster police investigating courtroom attack by Ripudaman Singh Malik killer",The Vancouver Sun (Online); Vancouver,Vancouver,"Bolan, Kim",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 7, 2025",Criminal sentences; Criminal investigations; Murders & murder attempts; Firearms,Nom: Air India; NAICS: 481111,2025-03-07,The Vancouver Sun
"FIRST READING: With NDP staring down electoral collapse, Singh walks back pledge to defeat Liberals",2025,"First Reading is a daily newsletter keeping you posted on the travails of Canadian politicos, all curated by the National Post's own Tristin Hopper. To get an early version sent directly to your inbox, sign up here TOP STORY With the NDP staring down some of the worst poll numbers in their history, leader Jagmeet Singh is suddenly walking back his pledge to bring down the Liberal government at the earliest opportunity. Following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's prorogation of Parliament on Jan. 6, Singh repeatedly promised that as soon as the House of Commons reconvened on March 24, his first action would be to trigger an election with a vote of non confidence. ""I've been really clear, and I remain clear, and I appreciate the opportunity to repeat it. We will be voting to bring down the government at the earliest opportunity,"" he told CTV on Jan. 20 Singh was even more explicit at a public appearance in Sault Ste Marie, Ont., where he said, ""We will be voting against the government when we return to Parliament at the end of March and there will be an election in the spring."" But when the NDP leader was reminded of the pledge at a Parliament Hill press availability this week, he replied that an election can wait. ""We're literally in a trade war, and I can't imagine any opposition leader that wouldn't want to support a package to help workers impacted by this,"" he said. ""We need supports for workers first ... and an election afterwards."" This isn't the first time that Singh has softened his promise to trigger a general election as soon as possible, although in earlier iterations the NDP leader has suggested that the House of Commons be convened earlier to pass a trade war relief package - after which they could stick with the plan of bringing down the Liberal government on March 24. Singh's comments this week are the first time he's suggested that even upon the March 24 return of Parliament, he'll continue propping up the minority Liberals for at least a little while. The NDP's apparent about-face on the issue of an immediate non-confidence vote just happens to coincide with a series of polls showing that the party appears to be lurching towards their worst-ever showing in a general election. A Leger poll published this week found the NDP polling at 12 per cent. An Angus Reid Institute survey put the party at 11 per cent. Both of these represent a wholesale collapse for a party that has spent years hovering at around 20 per cent of the electorate - and mere weeks ago was a contender to form the official opposition. According to election modeller Raymond Liu, the Leger numbers would yield an NDP caucus of eight seats in the next parliament. The Angus Reid Institute figures would yield a caucus of just seven. Latest Angus Reid poll modelled out CON: 151 seats (+32) LIB: 146 seats (-14) BQ: 39 seats (+7) NDP: 7 seats (-18) GRN: 0 seats (-2) Conservative Minority Feel free to ask for any ridings - Charestiste?????? (@RealAlbanianPat) March 5, 2025 Both of these outcomes would represent the worst-ever electoral showing for the federal NDP. Since the party's 1961 founding, their worst result to date has been in the 1993 general election, when they won just nine seats under leader Audrey McLaughlin. As per polling trends maintained by both Leger and the Angus Reid Institute, the collapse is due largely to NDP voters fleeing to the Liberals. As recently as December, it was the Liberals who were fated to emerge from the next election with a caucus small enough to fit in a mini bus. But with the announced departure of Trudeau and the likely accession of Mark Carney as his replacement, the party has experienced a mild polling boost, almost entirely at the expense of the NDP. While this briefly made Carney a favourite to win the next general election, polls have now reverted back to predicting a scenario in which the Conservatives are poised to secure victory, if not a majority. Whatever Singh's intentions on bringing down the Liberal government, he may not get the chance. The Liberals pick their new leader on Sunday, and if Carney ends up winning, he has said he is willing to drop the writs for an election before Parliament has a chance to reconvene on March 24. Trudeau was within his rights to request prorogation, Federal Court says in historic ruling Trump pausing tariffs on Canadian goods under CUSMA until April 2 Although, similar to what Singh is saying, Carney has said he would make a final decision based on the current state of tariff negotiations with the U.S. Of the major parties, the NDP is also the least prepared for a general election. The party has only just finished paying off a $20 million loan it had to take out to contest the 2021 federal election, and as of last year the party barely had enough cash on hand to cover Singh's travel expenses for a national campaign. IN OTHER NEWS According to the Wall Street Journal, profanity was reportedly employed during a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The swear words, whatever they are, were reportedly used by Trump, and were not in regards to fentanyl or illegal migration - the two stated reasons for the current trade war. According to a Canadian source who spoke to the CBC, they were in regards to strict Canadian border controls on dairy. While most U.S. goods have tariff-free access to the Canadian market under normal conditions, dairy is a notable exception. In order to protect domestic dairy farms from outside competition, any imported dairy must adhere to tight quotas or it is tariffed at more than 300 per cent. The screenshot above comes from a web video with more than six million views in which Alberta lawyer Jeffrey Rath says he is putting together a delegation to travel to Washington, D.C., in order to make the case for Alberta as the 51st state. ""It's quite evident that we're being governed by idiots in Ottawa who don't understand that we can't afford a trade war with our largest trading partner,"" said Rath, adding that the appropriate tack should have been ""apologizing"" to U.S. President Donald Trump. One critique against the Liberals of late is that party brass have had their heart set on Mark Carney winning the leadership. One piece of evidence for the ""Carney coronation"" camp is that Carney is the only leadership candidate who's been receiving briefings about the ongoing U.S./Canadian trade war. This is particularly notable because Carney isn't a member of the Privy Council or even an MP, and thus isn't bound by any of the confidentiality and conflict-of-interest guidelines that govern the other candidates. According to the White House, the stated reason for the U.S./Canadian trade war is to pressure Canada into addressing ""unchecked drug trafficking."" Statements like the above Truth Social post by U.S. President Donald Trump would seem to suggest that the conflict has other motives. Trump also doesn't seem to be aware that Trudeau only has a few more days to be prime minister and isn't contesting the next election.

"Many election vows incognito in NDP's budget; Involuntary treatment, grocery rebate, Nanaimo patient tower among the missing",2025,"One of the distractions for reporters this week was tracking the election promises that did not make it all the way into the first budget of the re-elected NDP. Take involuntary care for the mentally ill and severe drug addicts, people who account for a disproportionate number of random, violent attacks on B.C. streets. In his bid for the NDP leadership, David Eby vowed to divert those people into care and treatment, with or without their consent. Once he'd secured his hold on the premier's office, he shelved the promise. He revived it in the run-up to last year's election, making it a centrepiece of his plan for addressing public safety, the drug crisis and care of the mentally ill. After that double reversal, one might have expected involuntary treatment to earn a prominent place in this week's budget and three-year fiscal plan. It was nowhere to be found. Still, Eby insisted that involuntary care was in the budget, albeit not in so many words. The funding was buried in the budget increase for the Ministry of Health. ""It's not correct that there weren't resources in the budget for this initiative,"" the premier told reporters Wednesday. ""The money is there to make sure it happens."" The first two treatment facilities - one at the Surrey pretrial jail, the other a new facility in Maple Ridge - will open in the spring, says Eby. The NDP rolled out a $1.29 billion housing plan for first-time homebuyers on election eve. It did not earn a line item in the budget either. There was a passing reference to a dozen and half projects, with 1,400 units for middle-income working people that are supposed to be started this year. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon says the plan for first-time homebuyers is in the budget - incognito. ""It is very much part of the plan,"" he told Alec Lazenby of Postmedia Thursday. ""We expect to finalize all the details with our partners in the coming weeks. We actually expect to launch the ability for people to register to purchase homes within the first half of this year. So everything is on track, and the money is going to be in the budget."" Going to be in the budget? Once the budget and spending estimates are presented to the legislature (as Finance Minister Brenda Bailey did Tuesday), the funding is either in or out. Perhaps Kahlon expects to tap into the budget's $4 billion in unallocated contingencies. The housing minister has played a different game regarding a 90-unit supportive housing project in Richmond, slated for people with complex mental health and addictions problems. He withdrew the project just before the election, because of a backlash in a community where three NDP incumbents were fighting to hang on to their seats. Despite Kahlon's last-minute move, only one of the three were re-elected. The survivor was Kelly Greene, who the premier appointed minister of emergency management in the postelection cabinet shuffle. Once the electoral dust settled, Kahlon announced the project would go ahead after all. Richmond council, justifiably appalled at the NDP's electoral shenanigans, has so far withheld approval of the project. The election platform's biggest no show on budget day was the NDP's ""grocery rebate,"" which was going to deliver $1,000 to families and $500 to individuals at a cost of $1.8 billion. Instead, under the heading of ""reducing costs for families,"" the budget served up another $110 cash rebate from ICBC, costed at $410 million. Not much consolation there for people without cars. This is the NDP's fourth successive cash grab from ICBC since they brought in no-fault insurance, confirming again that the scheme is a great bargain for taxpayers. Just hope you don't sustain a catastrophic, life-altering injury. Then you'll be confronted with a take it or leave it settlement from an insurance monopoly, ever mindful of the need to protect the cash reserves necessary to underwrite the Eby government's cynical givebacks. The NDP election platform promised $500 million for ""more new child care spaces."" On budget day, child care funding was ""flatlined,"" according to advocate Sharon Gregson. It means no progress this year on the NDP goal of universal, $10-a day child care. Lastly, there's the short life of Eby's vow to build a new patient tower at Nanaimo regional hospital for a cost estimated at $2 billion. He made the prom-ise Sept. 26. It went missing on budget day. ""A new patient tower is literally a decade-plus overdue and will take another decade to build from start to finish,"" Nanaimo Mayor (and former NDP MLA) Leonard Krog told Cindy Harnett of the Victoria Times Colonist. ""The rest of the province has not faced the consistent neglect that everyone north of the Malahat has faced for decades with respect to the appropriate health care and delivery of much-needed facilities."" With respect to the mayor, the promise has already accomplished what it was intended to do. It helped the New Democrats shut out the Conservatives and maintain their grip on the three legislature seats in and around Nanaimo. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 7, 2025",Child care; Funding; Home buyers; Substance abuse treatment,,2025-03-07,The Vancouver Sun
"NDP's budget should scare all B.C. families; $10.9B deficit completely out of touch, writes John Rustad",2025,"British Columbians received a chilling glimpse into B.C. NDP economics this week with the delivery of the 2025 budget. It's the kind of snapshot that keeps families up at night over the destructive nature of not only the just-introduced U.S. tariffs, but also their deep-seated doubts about the government's ability to steer us toward clearer skies. After listening to the cold, hard realities delivered by Finance Minister Brenda Bailey, all of us living in this province have great cause to worry on many fronts. We are reckoning with a record-breaking deficit of $10.9 billion, which represents an increase of $1.8 billion in just the past two months. We are expecting 45,000 job losses by 2029, and we have a debt-to-GDP ratio that will egregiously climb from 22.9 per cent to 34.4 per cent over three years. The NDP is also trumpeting an investment of $95 billion in public services to meet growing demand, yet the bloat of this administration - a 32 per cent increase to public sector jobs since they took power - predates U.S. President Donald Trump and his threats by many years. Simply put, this is a government that hasn't encountered a taxpayer-funded dollar it isn't willing to spend and, more concerningly, continues to employ stunning incompetence and political deception in response to Canada's current economic headwinds. The minister beamed with pride as she announced a $110 ICBC rebate that every NDP caucus member is burning up social media about. Of no surprise was the accompanying silence regarding Premier David Eby's cancellation of his election promise to deliver a $1,000 grocery rebate to every B.C. household. The NDP government believes that an $890 loss should be celebrated in every corner of the province. Then there's the issue of delivering a budget that is so devoid of tangible ideas that the NDP has decided to adopt the Conservative Party of B.C. agenda and electoral platform. Take, for example, the government's Low Carbon Fuels Act that has put a company like Tidewater Renewables in Prince George on the brink of insolvency. This is legislation that allows American fuel producers to flood our marketplace with subsidized diesel to receive the NDP's low-carbon fuel credits, creating an unfair marketplace and threatening our only renewable diesel refinery. Enter Conservative Party of B.C. MLA Kiel Giddens, who in response introduced a private member's bill to eliminate these loopholes from being exploited at the expense of B.C. producers. One day later, the NDP government announced that all biodiesel fuel sold in the province must be made in Canada. The same thing has just happened with my proposal to impose a carbon tax on American thermal coal exports through B.C. ports, which is a plan that Premier Eby has now confirmed he will bring to the federal government for consideration. This week I also introduced a free trade and mobility bill to turbocharge interprovincial trade by eliminating red tape and bureaucratic barriers between B.C. and other provinces. After watching David Eby talk about this subject since November, I could no longer tolerate his government avoiding the legislature so they could take an extended vacation. The same applies when Minister Bailey talks about ""sharpening our pencil"" through a ""hiring freeze"" while her government hires or promotes 35 new communications, political and executive staffers at a cost of $4.3 million in salaries. These are the policies of a government that doesn't believe its own spin. Because any finance minister who relies on statements like ""there is so much happening in the world right now that is beyond our control"" to justify fiscal management that is crippling average British Columbians, is completely out of touch. If the NDP government cannot employ concrete steps that place people ahead of empty rhetoric, they should stand down and let a party ready to lead, take action. B.C. and our residents can't afford for David Eby to continue learning how to do his job and play politics with our collective future. John Rustad is the Conservative Party of B.C. leader.","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Rustad, John",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 7, 2025",Carbon; Political parties,,2025-03-07,The Vancouver Sun

""I've been really clear, and I remain clear, and I appreciate the opportunity to repeat it. We will be voting to bring down the government at the earliest opportunity,"" he told CTV on Jan. 20. Singh was even more explicit at a public appearance in Sault Ste Marie, Ont., where he said, ""We will be voting against the government when we return to Parliament at the end of March and there will be an election in the spring."" But when the NDP leader was reminded of the pledge at a Parliament Hill press availability this week, he replied that an election can wait. ""We're literally in a trade war, and I can't imagine any opposition leader that wouldn't want to support a package to help workers impacted by this,"" he said. ""We need supports for workers first and an election afterwards."" This isn't the first time that Singh has softened his promise to trigger a general election as soon as possible, although in earlier iterations the NDP leader has suggested that the House of Commons be convened earlier to pass a trade war relief package - after which they could stick with the plan of bringing down the Liberal government on March 24. Singh's comments this week are the first time he's suggested that even upon the March 24 return of Parliament, he'll continue propping up the minority Liberals for at least a little while. The NDP's apparent about-face on the issue of an immediate non-confidence vote just happens to coincide with a series of polls showing that the party appears to be lurching toward their worst-ever showing in a general election. A Leger poll published this week found the NDP polling at 12 per cent. An An- gus Reid Institute survey put the party at 11 per cent. Both of these represent a wholesale collapse for a party that has spent years hovering at around 20 per cent of the electorate - and mere weeks ago was a contender to form the official opposition. According to election modeller Raymond Liu, the Leger numbers would yield an NDP caucus of eight seats in the next parliament. The Angus Reid Institute figures would yield a caucus ofjust seven. Both of these outcomes would represent the worstever electoral showing for the federal NDP. Since the party's 1961 founding, their worst result to date has been in the 1993 general election, when they won just nine seats under leader Audrey McLaughlin. As per polling trends maintained by both Leger and the Angus Reid Institute, the collapse is due largely to NDP voters fleeing to the Liberals. As recently as December, it was the Liberals who were fated to emerge from the next election with a caucus small enough to fit in a mini bus. But with the announced departure of Trudeau and the likely accession of Mark Carney as his replacement, the party has experienced a mild polling boost, almost entirely at the expense of the NDP. While this briefly made Carney a favourite to win the next general election, polls have now reverted back to predicting a scenario in which the Conservatives are poised to secure victory, if not a majority. Whatever Singh's intentions on bringing down the Liberal government, he may not get the chance. The Liberals pick their new leader on Sunday, and if Carney ends up winning, he has said he is willing to drop the writ for an election before Parliament has a chance to reconvene on March 24. Although, similar to what Singh is saying, Carney has said he would make a final decision based on the current state of tariff negotiations with the U.S. Of the major parties, the NDP is also the least prepared for a general election. The party has only just finished paying off a $20-million loan it had to take out to contest the 2021 federal election, and as of last year the party barely had enough cash on hand to cover Singh's travel expenses for a national campaign.

NDP budget should scare everyone in B.C.; We are reckoning with a record-breaking $10.9B deficit,2025,"British Columbians received a chilling glimpse into B.C. NDP economics this week with the delivery of the 2025 budget. It's the kind of snapshot that keeps families up at night over the destructive nature of not only the just-introduced U.S. tariffs, but also their deep-seated doubts about the government's ability to steer us toward clearer skies. After listening to the cold, hard realities delivered by Finance Minister Brenda Bailey, all of us living in this province have great cause to worry on many fronts. We are reckoning with a record-breaking deficit of $10.9 billion, which represents an increase of $1.8 billion in just the past two months. We are expecting 45,000 job losses by 2029, and we have a debtto-GDP ratio that will egregiously climb from 22.9 per cent to 34.4 per cent over three years. The NDP is also trumpeting an investment of $95 billion in public services to meet growing demand, yet the bloat of this administration - a 32 per cent increase to public sector jobs since they took power - predates U.S. President Donald Trump and his threats by many years. Simply put, this is a government that hasn't encountered a taxpayer-funded dollar it isn't willing to spend and, more concerningly, continues to employ stunning incompetence and political deception in response to Canada's current economic headwinds. The minister beamed with pride as she announced a $110 ICBC rebate that every NDP caucus member is burning up social media about. Of no surprise was the accompanying silence regarding Premier David Eby's cancellation of his election promise to deliver a $1,000 grocery rebate to every B.C. household. The NDP government believes that an $890 loss should be celebrated in every corner of the province. Then there's the issue of delivering a budget that is so devoid of tangible ideas that the NDP has decided to adopt the Conservative Party of B.C. agenda and electoral platform. Take, for example, the government's Low Carbon Fuels Act that has put a company like Tidewater Renewables in Prince George on the brink of insolvency. This is legislation that allows American fuel producers to flood our marketplace with subsidized diesel to receive the NDP's low-carbon fuel credits, creating an unfair marketplace and threatening our only renewable diesel refinery. Enter Conservative Party of B.C. MLA Kiel Giddens, who in response introduced a private member's bill to eliminate these loopholes from being exploited at the expense of B.C. producers. One day later, the NDP government announced that all biodiesel fuel sold in the province must be made in Canada. The same thing has just happened with my proposal to impose a carbon tax on American thermal coal exports through B.C. ports, which is a plan that Premier Eby has now confirmed he will bring to the federal government for consideration. This week I also introduced a Free Trade and Mobility bill to turbocharge interprovincial trade by eliminating red tape and bureaucratic barriers between B.C. and other provinces. After watching Eby talk about this subject since November, I could no longer tolerate his government avoiding the legislature so they could take an extended vacation. The same applies when Minister Bailey talks about ""sharpening our pencil"" through a ""hiring freeze"" while her government hires or promotes 35 new communications, political and executive staffers at a cost of $4.3 million in salaries. These are the policies of a government that doesn't believe its own spin. Because any finance minister who relies on statements like ""there is so much happening in the world right now that is beyond our control"" to justify fiscal management that is crippling average British Columbi- ans, is completely out of touch. If the NDP government cannot employ concrete steps that place people ahead of empty rhetoric, they should stand down and let a party ready to lead, take action. B.C. and our residents can't afford for Eby to continue learning how to do his job and play politics with our collective future.

"Second accused in contract killing of Ripudaman Singh Malik sentenced to life in prison:   Jose Lopez is set to be eligible for parole in 2042, taking into account time served",2025,"For the second time in as many months, a hit man has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 20 years for the public slaying of former Air India bombing suspect Ripudaman Singh Malik in July, 2022. And again, the British Columbia Supreme Court in New Westminster heard, the second gunman expressed remorse for the second-degree murder, but did not reveal who hired him and his co-defendant to carry out the daytime hit, which shocked the Sikh community in Surrey and raised questions about the potential the Indian state was somehow involved. Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, Mr. Malik’s daughter-in-law, addressed defendant Jose Lopez in court Friday, as she did at the end of January for the sentencing of co-accused Tanner Fox. She pleaded with Mr. Lopez to name their employer and said her family is shaken every time news breaks of a shooting or foreign interference among India’s Sikh diaspora. ""The fear and anxiety comes from not knowing who hired you,"" said Ms. Dhaliwal, who is a lawyer in Surrey. The killing occurred near the onset of a wave of homicides, extortions and other violent crimes across Canada that the RCMP and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have linked to the Indian government of Narendra Modi. Last year, Mr. Malik’s son was contacted by the RCMP, who told him they had a ""duty to warn"" him of a credible threat to his life, but the source of the danger remains unknown. Justice Terry Schultes accepted the joint submission from the Crown and the defence Thursday, but worried the public might be displeased by news of the plea deal and the sentence of second-degree murder, not first degree. The prosecution had characterized the killing as ""a cold-blooded execution carried out for financial compensation."" Justice Schultes clarified that both types of murder can be charged in intentional killings, and both result in life prison sentences. ""I do think something should be said about it in order to avoid any public misunderstanding or loss of confidence in the justice system,"" he said. Justice Schultes said Mr. Lopez was just 23 at the time of the killing and he has the support of his mother and three sisters, who were in court – two factors that bode well for a potential rehabilitation after he becomes eligible for parole in the summer of 2042. However, Justice Schultes noted his disappointment in Mr. Lopez for assaulting his co-accused as they entered their guilty pleas last fall. ""I take it as an indication that he’s unfortunately, at times, still acting according to impulses that take him outside the norms of civilized behaviour, especially in a courtroom setting. Although such actions obviously pale in comparison to the shooting, those impulses, as also reflected in his record for assault, are the things he will need to work hard on."" Mr. Lopez did not address the court, but his lawyer, Alice Vo, said he was remorseful for the killing and gave a brief biography of her client. Mr. Lopez was born in Winnipeg, then moved to Texas for about a year before coming to B.C. and moving quite often between Vancouver’s suburbs, she said. This home life hurt his ability to make friends and focus in school, she said. He dropped out in Grade 9 and moved out when he was 15 to work several different jobs, including in restaurants, as a labourer on construction sites and, most recently, as a tire technician at several automotive shops, the court heard. She said a year before the slaying, Mr. Lopez took a course at Vancouver Career College and wants to ultimately become an electrician. She did not touch on how he was hired to kill Mr. Malik. Mr. Malik was among three people charged with the Air India bombing of June 23, 1985, which killed 329 people, including 280 Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aboard an airliner that originated in Toronto and exploded off the coast of Ireland. Two baggage handlers at the Tokyo airport were also killed in another explosion the same day. Mr. Malik spent four and a half years in detention before being acquitted in 2005 along with Kamloops sawmill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri.

NDP unleashes bill blitz; 20 pieces of legislation introduced on single day,2025,"The Kinew government dropped 20 bills at once on Thursday in a bid to speed up its ambitious legislative agenda for 2025. Members of the NDP caucus took turns introducing a lengthy list of proposed legislation that aims to protect the universal school nutrition program, bolster tenant rights and increase reporting on P3 projects, among other changes. Government house leader Nahanni Fontaine said she was proud of her strategy to table as much as possible within the first days of the spring sitting. “We’ve shown Manitobans in the last 24 hours some pretty phenomenal legislation and shown, in real tangible ways, that we’ve been working really hard,” Fontaine told reporters Thursday. The NDP caucus has introduced almost 30 bills because members are mindful of deadlines and “want to make sure those bills get passed,” she said. Fontaine accused the official Opposition of wasting time with “fictitious matters of privilege” during the last sitting. The Progressive Conservatives did not host a news conference to respond to the bills. Six of the bills were tabled by Education Minister Tracy Schmidt. Bill 17 requires each public school to run a nutrition program tailored to local students’ needs and penalizes future legislators who scrap breakfast, lunch or snack programs. “It stipulates that cabinet members will be subject to a 20 per cent cut in ministerial salary if a bill is passed to reduce or repeal Nello’s Law,” Schmidt told the chamber. The Public Schools Amendment Act (Nutrition Equality for Lasting Learning Outcomes) has been nicknamed in memory of former education minister Nello Altomare, who rolled out the meal program before he died on Jan. 14. Asked about the constitutionality of the penalties, the new minister, who is a lawyer, said the document was drafted with legislative counsel advice. Schmidt also noted the Tories’ balanced budget legislation outlines retribution for a government that runs a deficit. “I personally can’t imagine a government in the future that would want or would be able to justify not feeding hungry kids,” she added. In a statement Thursday, Nathan Martindale, president of the Manitoba Teachers’ Society, called the bill “promising” at first glance. The minister of public service delivery had a lengthy list of legislation, ranging from a ban on restrictive covenants, which allow a grocery store owner to draw a map around their site and eliminate competitors, to making sure the province prioritizes Canadian suppliers when making purchases. Mintu Sandhu also previewed Bill 25 to provide Manitobans with more information when public entities enter a public-private partnership, also known as a P3, to complete a capital project of any kind. Future P3s would involve preliminary analysis, public consultation and the appointment of an external consultant to act as a “fairness monitor,” per the Public-Private Partnership Transparency and Accountability Act. Bills 10 and 32 both update the Residential Tenancies Act. The former aims to better support tenants who are displaced through no fault of their own — for instance, during a government-mandated evacuation. The latter helps landlords evict tenants who are engaged in drug or human trafficking faster. Bill 28 ends a longtime practice at Manitoba Hydro to approve large grid connections on a first-come, first-served basis. “For far too long, important economic development opportunities have been stalled by the first-come, first-served approach,” Finance Minister Adrien Sala said in support of an update that favours the wider economic benefits of an applicant’s project over timeliness. On the subject of Indigenous education, Schmidt brought in legislation backing new immersion streams and requiring school divisions to establish policies on land and treaty acknowledgements. Bill 39 mandates trustee candidates to report on their campaign donations, cap contributions and prohibit people who live outside of Manitoba from making any financial contributions to influence an election. Also Thursday, Schmidt said the province is doing away with dusty regulations about religious exercises and playing the royal anthem at the start or end of every school day. The Schools Patriotic Observances Regulation has not been enforced in 25 years, but its existence has come into question in recent weeks. Jason Gryba, who chairs the board of trustees in the Mountain View School Division, requested God Save the King be played in Dauphin-area classrooms in January to adhere to it. Critics have condemned its sudden and unexplained revival over concerns it celebrates colonialism and disregards related harms inflicted upon Indigenous families. The Transcona byelection to fill the seat left vacant by Altomare and subsequent blackout rules tempered the promotion of MLA bills. The province originally declined to immediately disclose the contents of all the new bills, but the majority of them were posted online Thursday afternoon. maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 7, 2025",Public private partnerships; Legislation; Education; Nutrition,,2025-03-07,Winnipeg Free Press
B.C. NDP's top priorities get scant mention in 2025 budget,2025,"VICTORIA - One of the distractions for reporters this week was tracking the election promises that did not make it all the way into the first budget of the re-elected NDP. Take involuntary care for the mentally ill and severe drug addicts, people who account for a disproportionate number of random, violent attacks on B.C. streets. In his bid for the NDP leadership, David Eby vowed to divert those people into care and treatment, with or without their consent. Once he'd secured his hold on the premier's office, he shelved the promise. He revived it in the run-up to last year's election, making it a centrepiece of his plan for addressing public safety, the drug crisis and care of the mentally ill. After that double reversal, one might have expected involuntary treatment to earn a prominent place in this week's budget and three-year fiscal plan. It was nowhere to be found. Still, Eby insisted that involuntary care was in the budget, albeit not in so many words. The funding was buried in the budget increase for the Ministry of Health. ""It's not correct that there weren't resources in the budget for this initiative,"" the premier told reporters Wednesday. ""The money is there to make sure it happens."" The first two treatment facilities - one at the Surrey pretrial jail, the other a new facility in Maple Ridge - will open in the spring, says Eby. The NDP rolled out a $1.29 billion housing plan for first-time homebuyers on election eve. It did not earn a line item in the budget either. There was a passing reference to a dozen and half projects, with 1,400 units for middle income working people that are supposed to be started this year. Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon says the plan for first time homebuyers is in the budget - incognito. ""It is very much part of the plan,"" he told Alec Lazenby of Postmedia Thursday. ""We expect to finalize all the details with our partners in the coming weeks. We actually expect to launch the ability for people to register to purchase homes within the first half of this year. So everything is on track, and the money is going to be in the budget."" Going to be in the budget? Once the budget and spending estimates are presented to the legislature (as Finance Minister Brenda Bailey did Tuesday), the funding is either in or out. Perhaps Kahlon expects to tap into the budget's $4 billion in unallocated contingencies. The housing minister has played a different game regarding a 90-unit supportive housing project in Richmond, slated for people with complex mental health and addictions problems. He withdrew the project just before the election, because of a backlash in a community where three NDP incumbents were fighting to hang on to their seats. Despite Kahlon's last-minute move, only one of the three were reelected. The survivor was Kelly Greene, who the premier appointed minister of emergency management in the postelection cabinet shuffle. Once the electoral dust settled, Kahlon announced the project would go ahead after all. Richmond council, justifiably appalled at the NDP's electoral shenanigans, has so far withheld approval of the project. The election platform's biggest no show on budget day was the NDP's ""grocery rebate,"" which was going to deliver $1,000 to families and $500 to individuals at a cost of $1.8 billion. Instead, under the heading of ""reducing costs for families,"" the budget served up another $110 cash rebate from ICBC, costed at $410 million. Not much consolation there for people without cars. This is the NDP's fourth successive cash grab from ICBC since they brought in no fault insurance, confirming again that the scheme is a great bargain for taxpayers. Just hope you don't sustain a catastrophic, life-altering injury. Then you'll be confronted with a take it or leave it settlement from an insurance monopoly, ever mindful of the need to protect the cash reserves necessary to underwrite the Eby government's cynical givebacks. The NDP election platform promised $500 million for ""more new child care spaces."" On budget day, child-care funding was ""flatlined"" according to advocate Sharon Gregson. It means no progress this year on the NDP goal of universal, $10-a day child care. Lastly, there's the short life of Eby's vow to build a new patient tower at Nanaimo regional hospital for a cost estimated at $2 billion. He made the promise Sept. 26. It went missing on budget day. ""A new patient tower is literally a decade-plus overdue and will take another decade to build from start to finish,"" Nanaimo Mayor (and former NDP MLA) Leonard Krog told Cindy Harnett of the Victoria Times Colonist. ""The rest of the province has not faced the consistent neglect that everyone north of the Malahat has faced for decades with respect to the appropriate health care and delivery of much needed facilities."" With respect to the mayor, the promise has already accomplished what it was intended to do. It helped the New Democrats shut out the Conservatives and maintain their grip on the three legislature seats in and around Nanaimo. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related David Eby squandered the favourable financial position he inherited from John Horgan B.C.

Tory leadership hopeful b lames NDP for cancellation of his tourism permits,2025,"A leadership candidate for the Manitoba Tories has vowed to sue the provincial government after it cancelled two polar bear viewing vehicle permits for his tour company in Churchill. Wally Daudrich, who is battling Obby Khan for the party leadership, said he met with a lawyer and court documents will be filed in the next few days. “I joined this race to fight corruption and that’s what I’m fighting right now,” Daudrich said on Wednesday. “Why are they singling my permits out and not somebody else’s?” He blamed NDP Premier Wab Kinew. “I believe that our provincial government, under the present administration, is weaponizing the bureaucracy in an attempt to hurt the leading contender in the PC race… Mr. Kinew has weaponized the bureaucracy against me.” Daudrich’s company, Lazy Bear Lodge and Expeditions, has operated hotel rooms and tundra buggy tours of polar bears and other wildlife in Churchill for years. He said the province told him it cancelled the permits because of concern the bear population’s feeding habits were negatively affected by the number of vehicles that encroach on their habitat. Not only does he dispute that claim, but questioned why the province would cancel permits at a time when Canada is in a tariff war launched by the United States. “Why would our government all of a sudden try to destroy a part of the economy which is actually tariff-proof?” he said. “There is ample evidence the bureaucracy is being weaponized against my company and only my company.” Natural Resources Minister Ian Bushie insisted politics played no part in the decision. “We are not politicizing this in any way,” Bushie said, adding the department had recommended the permits be cancelled. “It is the department doing its due diligence and having the recommendation of walking back the limits to 2018, which was the norm that had been happening for quite some time. “There was no political interference or political decision-making that had a political kind of reference whatsoever. This is doing right by the habitat, doing right by the tundra, doing right by Churchill.” In 2020, the Tory government under Brian Pallister added two polar bear viewing vehicle permits to the 18 which had been allowed since 1984 and awarded them to Lazy Bear. Daudrich, who has run for the federal Conservative party twice and once for the Reform Party of Canada, said that decision had nothing to do with him or other family members donating more than $86,000 to the provincial Tory party since 2016. Almost $60,000 of that was donated between 2016 and 2020, when the permit was awarded. “You can argue I’m hated in Churchill because I’m a Conservative,” he said. “I give my max to the federal party as well and I have for decades… I have a long history of being a conservative. “I’m a leadership candidate and the timing of it is done to try to pull me aside my campaign. I will deal with this as leader.” A provincial spokesman confirmed two polar bear viewing vehicle permits have been cancelled to get back to the number of licenses recommended by the 2013 Churchill Wildlife Management Area plan. “This decision is intended to protect the sensitive tundra ecosystem,” the spokesman said in a statement. “The (plan) represents a fragile ecosystem and after extensive engagement in the fall of 2024, the province determined that polar bear viewing tourism is saturated and the province needed to return to the previously set limit of 18 vehicles within the (plan).” The spokesman said the two permits which were cancelled, had been the last ones granted. Daudrich said he will continue to run tours, using four permits he was given in 2004, which allow him to drive in smaller areas near Churchill. “There won’t be less vehicles; they will be vehicles limited in the territory they can cover.” The Tory party will announce its next leader at a convention on April 26. kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Kevin Rollason","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Rollason, Kevin",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Mar 6, 2025",Animal populations; Taiga & tundra; Bears; Bureaucracy; Tourism; Permits; Political leadership; Decision making; Vehicles; Tariffs,Nom: Lazy Bear; NAICS: 722511,2025-03-06,Winnipeg Free Press
Mulcair: Soraya Martinez Ferrada is a catch for Ensemble Montréal,2025,"It's rare in politics for one person to have unanimous recognition and praise across a broad spectrum of society. The new head of the Ensemble Montréal municipal party, Soraya Martinez Ferrada, is one such person. When she first ran in Hochelaga riding under the federal Liberal banner of Justin Trudeau, I had my doubts. The riding had been held for two terms by my formidable NDP colleague Marjolaine Boutin-Sweet, who'd chosen not to run in 2019. Martinez Ferrada pulled off a squeaker of a win, just edging out the candidate for a resurgent Bloc Québécois. It was an implausible and indeed remarkable gain for the Liberals. I remember being surprised to learn that progressives I knew had gone over to the Liberals. They were all effusive in their praise of Martinez Ferrada. The NDP ran a respected and seasoned candidate, Catheryn Roy-Goyette, who benefited from the excellent team of organizers Boutin-Sweet had put in place during her terms of office. When it became clear that the NDP was in provincewide difficulty in that election, several people I spoke with had made the strategic choice to support Martinez Ferrada. They all shared the same very positive evaluation of her as a person and a candidate. Their praise was unstinting. They saw her as a progressive with a pragmatic bent, formed by years of experience at the municipal level. Born in Chile, her parents fled the Pinochet regime and settled in Canada. She speaks perfect French and fluent English. She's a graduate of top business school HEC. She used her municipal expertise to learn the ropes quickly in Ottawa, rising to the position of tourism minister in Trudeau's cabinet. It was during a conversation I had with a very senior and highly respected player in Montreal's tourism industry that I realized Martinez Ferrada had a growing list of admirers. He explained that it had been painfully difficult dealing with Martinez Ferrada's predecessor as federal tourism minister. On the other hand, he had nothing but praise for her, especially her willingness to listen. He gave me a specific example where he and others in the industry met with her to explain a situation where a change from the federal government could be beneficial to this key industry. He remarked how Martinez Ferrada quickly grasped the complex issue. She promised to get back to them. Two weeks later, she did just that and it was to announce that she would be making the desired change. That, according to those who know Martinez Ferrada, is one of her key qualities: the ability to listen and to achieve results. This isn't going to be an easy election and Ensemble Montréal still has a sizable debt. But Denis Coderre's old party has one main thing going for it: experienced councillors who've rallied behind Martinez Ferrada I keep hearing the names of very qualified people, like former provincial minister David Heurtel and outgoing Montreal chamber of commerce head Michel Leblanc, mentioned as possible mayoral candidates. If they're serious, they'd better get organized quickly. Valérie Plante's Projet Montréal is a redoubtable force, not to be underestimated. Its deep roots among trade unions and community groups gives it a strong lever to get out the vote, always a challenge in municipal elections. But the land of the orange cones is in desperate need of new, competent and inspiring leadership, and that is exactly what Martinez Ferrada offers. I sat down for lunch with her and was really impressed. She spoke of the importance of listening and used the example of Plante's ignoring the results of a massive consultation about access to Mount Royal as a case in point. I can safely predict that Martinez Ferrada will really shake things up in this fall's municipal election.

NDP carelessly piling up $209B debt with little to show for it,2025,"The New Democrats continued their reckless approach to the management of B.C. finances on Tuesday, with a budget and fiscal plan that proposes to push the provincial debt to $209 billion within three years. The increase would be more than double the $90 billion debt in 2022, when John Horgan handed over the premier's office to David Eby. Yet the new budget had little in the way of new programs or improvements in existing ones, something many interest groups pointed out. The government line was to blame all this debt-loading on Tuesday's arrival of President Donald Trump's unjustified 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports to the U.S. David Eby emphasized that theme when he made a rare appearance (for a premier) in the budget lockup to deliver a stand-fast message in the tariff fight. To that end, Eby announced that B.C. would again be evicting ""red states"" booze from government liquor stores. For all the NDP efforts to blame their fiscal troubles exclusively on Trump and tariffs, their own budget documents tell a different story. On Sept. 30 of last year, before Trump's election and before he announced the tariffs, the New Democrats had already sub- merged the province deeply in red ink. They were forecasting a record $9.4 billion deficit with no help needed from the occupant of the White House. Over the past three months of 2024, the province experienced an improvement in its fiscal fortunes. There was a $1.4 billion windfall on the revenue side from corporate taxes, ICBC, the employer health tax, fees and other sources. The government also recorded $1.5 billion in savings from reduced transfer payments to service agencies and less of a take-up on refundable tax credits. Had the New Democrats put those resources to good use, they could have reduced the forecast deficit for the year by almost $3 billion. But that is not the NDP way. Instead, they increased spend- ing in other areas by more than $2 billion. It left only a little less than $300 million to reduce the deficit down to $9.14 billion, still a record. Finance Minister Brenda Bailey was asked in the budget news conference to square the soaring provincial debt with her claim that Budget 2025 represents ""government's efforts to return B.C. to fiscal sustainability."" These things take time, she explained. This year's budget and three-year fiscal plan were only the first step. Yet her own documents showed that every debt metric - total debt, taxpayer supported debt, self-supporting debt, debt measured as a share of revenue, debt as a share of gross domestic product, the interest on the debt - were all headed in the wrong direction. As first steps go, this one is poised to take the province down the fiscal equivalent of an elevator shaft. Bailey claimed a hiring freeze was one way that the province will rein in spending. For the next three years, starting April 1, the budget imposes a cap of 38,900 full-time equivalent employees. That's for the year starting April 1. In the current year, which is not quite over, the New Democrats have already added almost 2,000 employees. Indeed, Bailey herself would appear to be sneaking through a few more hires before the March 31 end of the financial year. B.C. Conservative MLA Peter Milobar, the Opposition finance critic, challenged Bailey in question period Monday over 36 recent hires, 19 of them in her own Ministry of Finance. Total additional payroll, in excess of $4 million annually. Nor were they front-line workers. The cabinet orders list the hires as mostly political and communications staffers in a government that is already top heavy with those positions. Bailey said the ministry will be ""sharpening our pencils"" to rein in spending. The budget includes ""expenditure management targets"" of $300 million in the financial year beginning April 1 and $600 million in the following two years. That's a lot of pencil sharpening. But the budget provided no breakdown of when or where or how the $1.5 billion would be saved. I asked Bailey how the public would be able to determine if she'd actually hit those targets, given the lack of detail. She said the plan was a work in progress and the amounts should be regarded as ""placeholders."" There you have the NDP plan for expenditure management - $1.5 billion worth of unspecified guesses. At least the finance minister answered my question. She fobbed off several reporters by saying they should take it up with her technical staff. I don't recall Carole James, finance minister in John Horgan's first term of government, ever deflecting questions that way during a budget lockup. True to the Eby government approach to budget-making, Bailey is budgeting for $30 billion worth of deficits over the coming three years, offset by $12 billion in unallocated contingency funds. Not included are the full impact of the Trump tariffs or the likelihood that the carbon tax will be phased out, as both federal and provincial leaders have promised. She also claims to be working on a plan to balance the budget ""over time.""

However, here, Mr. Lewis has done exactly what he professes to decry by perpetuating his version of ""the falsehoods of the past."" He has skewed his version of the history to somehow absolve the NDP government of the day from blame for the choices they made in April 1993. Instead, what the NDP need to do is to acknowledge the facts, understand the hurt caused and look for a reconciliation with rural Saskatchewan. Until the NDP, as a political party hoping to be government, achieve such a reconciliation, they will continue to be the willing victims of the Saskatchewan Party malignity.

Mr. Lewis touts the findings of the survey he conducted four years after the A-bomb, but what he has withheld from this discussion is the truth about WHY respondents four years later said the things his survey reported. Mr. Lewis also characterizes the A-bomb as a ""gutsy decision"" and ""the right call."" He ought to have cleared those comments with Mr. Romanow, who, I recall, in one of his last interviews before his retirement, said the hospital closures issue was the single biggest mistake of his political career. The truth about why Mr. Lewis's survey respondents were feeling better about health care four years after the A-bomb was because they felt more secure. They felt more secure because in 1993-94 the Rural Heath Coalition was formed and across rural Saskatche- wan we fought the A-bomb and the government who dropped it.

For months the fight continued. Only after almost 500 people gathered in the hall at Ponteix, rose to their feet as one in ovation at the end of the speeches and did so in front of the rolling TV cameras, did Mr. Romanow direct then-MLA Lorne Calvert to act as an emissary to contact the Rural Health Coalition and determine if a solution could be found. A top-secret meeting between Mr. Calvert and me was brokered by former minister Lorne Scott and took place in a third-party recreation room in Regina. The occupants of the house were asked to vacate so they could not identify who was meeting in their basement. These discussions led to a set of intense negotiations that took several months. The result was a contract in February 1994 between the government of Saskatchewan and the Rural Health Coalition (representing 51 communities). That agreement secured 24-hour emergency services and other acute and long-term care services in the 51 communities. And the province guaranteed the funding to make this happen. The agreement also contained a promise by the Saskatchewan government to never again try to make such critical changes to service in the 51 communities without engaging in meaningful negotiations with a community through a specified process. That process was negotiated and agreed upon several years later. Gosh, Mr. Lewis, no wonder your survey respondents were feeling better four years later.

"Spend more on schools, NDP told; Educators fear campaign promises will take back seat to tariff threats",2025,"As Finance Minister Brenda Bailey gets set to introduce B.C.'s budget today, the province's educational sector is warning it isn't getting enough support to keep up with a growing student population and the needs that come with that. There are also concerns that campaign promises could fall by the wayside as the government rushes to respond to tariffs set to be imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on the same day as the budget release. Bailey told reporters Monday that there won't be any cuts to education in the budget, but stopped short of saying it will include key NDP commitments during the last election to staff every school with a psychologist and every classroom from kindergarten to Grade 3 with an educational assistant. ""I think what's important for people to know is that we have not stepped back in the priorities for British Columbians. In fact, we continue to work with them,"" she said. ""The things that they prioritize, things like health care and education, public safety and social services are protected in this budget and, at the same time, we're looking for efficiency."" Over the weekend, the Surrey school district said it's facing a $16 million shortfall and could be forced to cut music programming and the Strong Start program for early learners. Due to budget constraints, the school district also dramatically cut funding to school bus service for more than 500 Surrey students, including children with special needs for the current school year, and moved to close three of its learning centres, leaving parents and students decrying the loss of supports for vulnerable kids. Terry Allen, Surrey school board vice-chairperson, said all districts are required to balance their budgets by law and, with 93 per cent of their roughly $1 billion budget going toward salaries and benefits, programs are the only place where cuts can be made. Parents in Surrey have previously raised concerns about the portion of district wages allocated to higher-level employees, such as school district Supt. Mark Pearmain, who earned $395,887 in 2023, according to public records. That same year, more than half of the district's total wages - 56.3 per cent - went to employees earning over $75,000 annually, totalling $381,921,640 out of $678,157,577. ""Over the years, there's been a number of programs and initiatives put into the school district because we had surpluses, but at the end of the day, they don't receive direct funding,"" said Allen. ""That's really why the majority of those things are actually on the block, and to be the same with the busing was a huge deal for the board last year, simply because there's no money for busing."" Allen said the programs like learning centres are hard to keep funded because the school district already spends $55 million more on special education then they're allocated by the province. The cuts come as Surrey continues to make news for having to stack portables on top of each other as it struggles to keep up with rapid population growth that has overwhelmed the capacity of many existing schools. The district's budget consultation survey will be open until April 6, with parents urged to provide their input and voice their concerns. B.C. Teachers' Federation president Clint Johnston said that while Surrey might be in an especially precarious position, they're far from alone in facing funding and staffing shortages. Johnston said many rural communities in particular are struggling due to many years of neglect by the province and are unable to support the needs of teachers. ""It's not just the direct, but even the peripheral. There's places in British Columbia where there's just no housing,"" he said. ""How do you get those public servants, which is what teachers really are, how do you get them to those communities and get them to stay there?"" The head of the teachers' union said he wants to see the government ""put its money where its mouth is"" and invest in education. Education Minister Lisa Beare declined to say what will be in the budget, deferring to Bailey, but did tell reporters at the legislature she understands the concerns of parents who could see their students negatively impacted by service cuts. At the same time, she defended her government's investments in education, pointing specifically to the NDP's increase in funding for the Surrey school district over the years. ""I share the concerns with parents about vitally important programs for their kids. We want to make sure that kids have all the supports they need in the education system to thrive, which is why year after year, we have continually increased funding for education,"" said Beare. University of B.C. education professor Jason Ellis said the problem for both school districts and the province is that there is only so much money to go around. ""When enrolments increase and teachers' salary costs increase, districts sometimes have to cut programs that are not covered under the allocation formula,"" he said. ""When you have a $1 billion budget and a $16 million shortfall, that's not a significant cut, but it does mean that you're going to have to think about some of those programs that you're not required to provide.""","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec; Grochowski, Sarah",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 4, 2025",Learning centers; Students; Funding; Teachers; Education; School boards; Wages & salaries; School districts,,2025-03-04,The Vancouver Sun
"NDP Engineers abbott Comeback; Ex-cabinet minister was named to treaty commission in 2015, then yanked from it",2025,"There was no overlooking the satisfaction in the NDP government's recent announcement that former B.C. Liberal cabinet minister George Abbott had been appointed provincial representative on the treaty commission. ""George Abbott is a seasoned diplomat who has significant experience of working with First Nations, local governments, labour and business,"" the minister of Indigenous relations and reconciliation, Christine Boyle, said in a news release last month. She cited Abbott's 17 years as an MLA and 12 years as a cabinet minister in past B.C. Liberal governments. ""Abbott led portfolios in Indigenous relations, sustainable resource management, health and education,"" she continued. ""During his role as minister of Aboriginal relations and reconciliation, Abbott regularly engaged in the work of the treaty commission."" The New Democrats left it to observers with long memories to recall an unhappy detail from Abbott's relationship with the federal-provincial-Indigenous commission overseeing the treaty process. Ten years ago, he'd been on the verge of taking a seat on the treaty commission only to have then Liberal premier Christy Clark pull out the rug from under him. The date was March 18, 2015. Abbott, who'd retired from the legislature in 2013, was scheduled to take over at the end of the month as chief commissioner from retiring Sophie Pierre. Abbott was at the commission offices, being briefed on its work. Then he got an unexpected call from the provincial government. The B.C. Liberals were withdrawing their support for his appointment. The federal government had tacitly approved of Abbott. The First Nations Summit was on side as well. Both were caught off guard. Pierre, the departing chief commissioner, blasted the province for reneging on an appointment that had been vetted by the treaty partners over several months. ""To pull this away at the 11th hour questions the commitment of B.C. to the treaty process,"" she said. ""This is not the way to effect reconciliation."" Pierre paid tribute to Abbott's ""integrity, intelligence and extensive experience,"" words that would echo down through the years to the news release the New Democrats put out last month. Abbott was humiliated, shocked and bewildered all at once. The news was communicated to him by the then-provincial minister of Aboriginal relations, John Rustad. But when Abbott spoke to me the day after his ouster in 2015, he didn't blame the minister. Rustad had recruited him for the position. He'd been clearly embarrassed at having to deliver the news that the offer was withdrawn. Rather, Abbott guessed that the move was payback for his outspoken bid for the party leadership following the departure of premier Gordon Campbell. He'd finished third to Christy Clark and Kevin Falcon. Rustad, like other Liberal MLAs and ministers from the north and Interior, had backed Abbott, the longtime MLA for Shuswap. The campaign had left some ""deep memories of real and perceived hurts,"" Abbott speculated. ""Some knives came out in the cabinet room. ... It is the only conclusion I can form."" Rustad stuck to the government line. The cabinet had decided, at the last minute, to go in a different direction on the treaty process. Clark denied she was settling scores from the leadership race. ""George is someone that I counted on for two years when he was a senior minister in my government,"" she told reporters. ""I have a great deal of respect for him.""

"Singh pays price for pact with PM; He protected Trudeau, now polls have cratered",2025,"Jagmeet Singh wouldn't listen in 2022 when it was suggested propping up the Trudeau Liberals wasn't a good idea. Trudeau was not a popular leader. His days as the shiny new face in Ottawa were well behind him. At the time the ""supply and confidence agreement"" was reached the country had just endured an ill-timed election, called by the prime minister two years before it was due in hopes of leveraging the COVID-19 crisis into a majority government. The gambit didn't work and Trudeau was handed another minority, almost identical to the one he'd already had. It was a clear message that voters felt the government hadn't done anything to deserve four secure years in power and should get on with the job using the tools it had been given. Pledging to provide the certainty Canadians had just withheld put Singh in a precarious position. He was coming to the aid of a rival party about which voters had obvious misgivings. Liberals would do their best to claim credit for any popular results from the pact while New Democrats would be left looking naive and outmanoeuvred. There was even a historical precedent: Former NDP leader David Lewis rescued an earlier Liberal minority regime in 1972, delivering safety from defeat to Pierre Trudeau in return for promises of policy concessions, only to have Trudeau call an opportune election two years later and gain a new majority while New Democrats lost half their seats. Lewis lost his own seat and the leadership as well. But Singh wouldn't listen. Now the NDP leader finds himself heading into an almost certain spring election deep in third place and sinking in the polls while the newly Trudeau-less Liberals gain ground. The Angus Reid Institute says data shows New Democrats have lost half their intended voters since late December. Among leaders and prospective leaders - including Liberal candidates Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland - Singh has the lowest favourability rating. A CBC poll tracker reports NDP support is down to just 14 per cent from 19 per cent in January. Another tracking site suggests Singh could be left with as few as 11 seats, below the minimum required for official party status. From Day One, Singh faced warnings he'd rented out his party too cheaply. In return for a pledge to show favour to NDP priorities, Trudeau was able to pretend his bad election result hadn't hap- pened. The pact was to last until June of this year, just before a new vote had to be called. Barring a blow-up, Liberals could be sure of three more years of relative safety from defeat, including four budgets and what a statement from the Prime Minister's Office identified as ""no surprises."" Trudeau retained the ability to cancel at any time and call an election should his fortunes improve. Singh can argue he successfully squeezed out important legislation from the arrangement. A $13 billion dental care plan was launched in 2024, initially covering about one million seniors with other groups to be added later. The plan is far from universal, covering a portion of costs for a range of treatment depending on family income for those lacking private insurance. A promised pharmacare pledge proved harder to collect on as Liberals passed for an extension on the initial deadline, prompting Singh to threaten he'd withdraw his support unless an acceptable bill was produced by March of last year. Agreement was eventually reached on a limited plan that centres on drugs for diabetes and contraception at an additional cost to governments of about $11 billion in the first year. Parliament also passed a ban on replacement workers during contract disputes and pledged new protections for renters against rent hikes and evictions. While all parties backed the anti-scab law and Canadian rents continue to set record highs, New Democrats see those and other policy actions as real achievements. Nonetheless, as predicted Liberals claimed credit while Singh found himself issuing a series of increasingly acerbic remarks about the frustrations of dealing with the Liberals, finally announcing in September he was cancelling the deal. ""Justin Trudeau has proven again and again he will always cave to corporate greed. The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians,"" he said, informing Trudeau's office of the decision just eight minutes before revealing it in a video. At the time Liberals looked to be on the ropes, stuck with an unpopular leader while facing an angry electorate. Since Trudeau announced his departure in January, however, Liberal fortunes have risen substantially while New Democrats have plunged. Singh has recently turned his guns on Carney, considered Trudeau's most likely successor, touting him as just another rich-man-in-government, ""cutting services people count on and handing out more to the billionaires."" ""I've asked Canadians this question, and I encourage folks to make this reflection themselves, 'is your life better or worse after nine years of Liberals being in power?' "" he demanded during a recent appearance in Edmonton. ""Is it more expensive or less expensive to buy a home? How about grocery prices, have they gone up or gone down? On each of these points, Canadians' lives are worse after nine years of Liberals."" He's got every right to make the point, of course. On the other hand, the Liberals might not have had the time and opportunity to do their damage if the NDP hadn't ensured them a three-year safe haven.

B.C. NDP engineers George Abbott comeback on treaty commission,2025,"VICTORIA - There was no overlooking the satisfaction in the NDP government's recent announcement that former B.C. Liberal cabinet minister George Abbott had been appointed provincial representative on the treaty commission. ""George Abbott is a seasoned diplomat who has significant experience of working with First Nations, local governments, labour and business,"" the minister of Indigenous relations and reconciliation, Christine Boyle, said in a news release last month. She cited Abbott's 17 years as an MLA and 12 years as a cabinet minister in the past B.C. Liberal governments. ""Abbott led portfolios in Indigenous relations, sustainable resource management, health and education,"" she continued. ""During his role as minister of Aboriginal relations and reconciliation, Abbott regularly engaged in the work of the treaty commission."" The New Democrats left it to observers with long memories to recall an unhappy detail from Abbott's relationship with the federal-provincial-Indigenous commission overseeing the treaty process. Ten years ago, he'd been on the verge of taking a seat on the treaty commission only to have then Liberal premier Christy Clark pull out the rug from under him. The date was March 18, 2015. Abbott, who'd retired from the legislature in 2013, was scheduled to take over at the end of the month as chief commissioner from retiring Sophie Pierre. Abbott was at the commission offices, being briefed on its work. Then he got an unexpected call from the provincial government. The B.C. Liberals were withdrawing their support for his appointment. The federal government had tacitly approved of Abbott. The First Nations Summit was on side as well. Both were caught off guard. Pierre, the departing chief commissioner, blasted the province for reneging on an appointment that had been vetted by the treaty partners over several months. ""To pull this away at the 11th hour questions the commitment of B.C. to the treaty process,"" she said. ""This is not the way to effect reconciliation."" Pierre paid tribute to Abbott's ""integrity, intelligence and extensive experience,"" words that would echo down through the years to the news release the New Democrats put out last month. Abbott was humiliated, shocked and bewildered all at once. The news was communicated to him by the then provincial minister of Aboriginal relations, John Rustad. But when Abbott spoke to me the day after his ouster in 2015, he didn't blame the minister. Rustad had recruited him for the position. He'd been clearly embarrassed at having to deliver the news that the offer was withdrawn. Rather, Abbott guessed that the move was payback for his outspoken bid for the party leadership following the departure of Premier Gordon Campbell. He'd finished third to Christy Clark and Kevin Falcon. Rustad, like other Liberal MLAs and ministers from the North and Interior, had backed Abbott, the longtime MLA for Shuswap. The campaign had left some ""deep memories of real and perceived hurts,"" Abbott speculated. ""Some knives came out in the cabinet room. ... It is the only conclusion I can form."" Rustad stuck to the government line. The cabinet had decided, at the last minute, to go in a different direction on the treaty process. Clark denied she was settling scores from the leadership race. ""George is someone that I counted on for two years when he was a senior minister in my government,"" she told reporters. ""I have a great deal of respect for him."" As for blindsiding him when he was about to take up his duties, ""ultimately I need to take responsibility for that."" Clark conceded. ""I do very much regret that the communication with George was done very, very badly."" She didn't regret it enough to restore him to the commission. She was still determined to speed up the slow-moving treaty process. Clark would remain premier for another two years. Speeding up the treaty process was not on her list of accomplishments. I spoke to Rustad recently about the Abbott appointment. The Conservative leader well remembered having to call his then friend in 2015 to say the cabinet no longer supported his appointment.

NDP's ground game pays off in legislature,2025,"If Liberal support in the Ontario election were a vehicle, it would be a gas-guzzling SUV. The NDP? More like a sleek, fuel-efficient sedan. While those vehicles might run on gasoline, electoral machines run on votes, and Liberal support last Thursday wasn't particularly efficient, generating just 14 seats despite the party getting 29.95 per cent of the popular vote. The NDP, meanwhile, wound up with 27 seats, despite slumping to 18.55 per cent of the vote. It is, political scientists and pollsters say, a credit to the NDP's decision to focus on areas where it has a significant base of support, while putting a token effort into the rest. It's also, they say, because of the way the party works at the local level. ""Once they pick up a riding, they work hard to keep the seat in the fold through strong relationships and focused local campaigns,"" said David Coletto, CEO of polling firm Abacus Data. ""They channel resources right to those ridings they know they can hold, and that strategy really pays off on election day."" The Liberals, by contrast, saw their vote spread out in ridings across the province. ""That can look good on the popular vote but doesn't always earn a lot of wins on election night,"" noted Coletto, who did polling for the Star during the Ontario campaign. Doug's Ford's Progressive Conservatives won their third straight majority, taking 80 seats with 42.97 per cent of the popular vote, and 2,158,452 voters marking their ballot for a PC candidate. Put another way, the PCs ""spent"" 26,981 votes per seat. The NDP, who won Official Opposition status for the second straight election, had the support of 931,796 voters, meaning they ""spent"" 34,511 votes per seat. And the Liberals, who earned the support of 1,504,688 Ontarians? They ""spent"" a whopping 107,478 votes per seat. (The Greens won two seats with 242,822 votes, and ""spent"" 121,411 votes per seat.) In addition to having an efficient vote, the NDP also benefits from having a strong base of loyal party activists at the riding level, who are adept at getting supporters to actually get out and vote on election day, says pollster Darrell Bricker. ""It's a bit of an old joke, but it's that if you're going to get canvassed in a snowstorm, it'll be by the NDP. They're kind of known for their ground game,"" said Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs and a fellow at U of T's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. ""They tend to have a lot of community organizations, people who are very activist, that they know that they're not necessarily going to win the election overall, but they know that it's important for them to win their riding,"" Bricker said. Just as important as how they worked in ridings they won, said Bricker, is how the NDP operated in areas where they lost. ""When you look at the ones they lost, they tended to lose by a lot, which means that they didn't waste their time trying to get votes where they couldn't get them,"" said Bricker. The relatively small number of seats won by the Liberals is also thanks to the first-past-the-post voting system, argued York University political scientist Dennis Pilon, a member of Fair Vote Canada, a group which advocates for electoral form. Despite winning almost 30 per cent of the popular vote, the Liberals captured just 11 per cent of the seats. The NDP captured 22 per cent of the seats with 18.6 per cent of the vote. ""It was pretty standard operating system for first past the post,"" said Pilon, noting that the winning Tories got 65 per cent of the seats with 43 per cent of the popular vote.

"Essex stays blue for a second term; Leardi re-elected with 55% of the tally, topping NDP by more than 18,000 votes",2025,"After flipping Essex to the Progressive Conservatives for the first time in 60 years in the 2022 election, PC incumbent Anthony Leardi has strengthened the party's grip on the riding with a second consecutive win. With all 58 polls reporting, Leardi secured 30,785 votes (55.4 per cent) Thursday night, ahead of New Democratic Party runner-up Rachael Mills, who earned 12,047 votes (21.7 per cent). Liberal candidate Tamara Stomp was third at 8,707 votes (15.7 per cent). ""I'm very happy that we've won another majority government,"" Leardi told reporters Thursday among a room full of supporters at Sutton Creek Golf Club in Essex. ""I'm very happy that Doug Ford has received a strong mandate from the people of Ontario. ""We're going to protect Ontario workers, we're going to protect Ontario businesses, and we're going to deal with this threat of tariffs and we're going to come out stronger."" As he heads back to Queen's Park, Leardi said Essex County residents can expect a majority government focused on expanding the manufacturing sector. ""We are going to continue to train more skilled workers who are going to build the projects, the roads, the highways and the homes for the people of Ontario."" Mills, a first-time candidate, described her campaign experience as a whirlwind. ""I couldn't imagine myself doing this a month ago, but it is the most natural thing at this point,"" she said while surrounded by supporters at Tailgaters Sports Bar in Essex. ""I think that if I'm given a bit more of a runway (in a future election), I'd be unstoppable. ""So I'm really excited for what comes next and this is definitely not the last time. And if I am not the winner tonight they better be ready for this watchdog 'cuz this is just the drill head of this adventure."" Liberal candidate Tamara Stomp, a lawyer and former deputy mayor of Kingsville, said the campaign was a challenge because of the short time frame and the winter weather. ""The sleet and the snow and the ice and a winter campaign, in a short time period ... was, I think, purposely well-thought-out by Doug Ford and to the advantage of the incumbents,"" Stomp said Thursday night. A little more than 50 per cent of 109,002 registered voters in Essex cast a ballot this election, a decrease from 2022, when voter turnout was 47.21 per cent. Voters in the riding followed a familiar pattern from the last few elections where it largely devolved into a two-way race between the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives. In 2022, Leardi broke through in Essex with 24,926 votes (51 per cent), outpacing NDP runner-up Ron LeClair by 11,133 votes. Reconfigured in 1999, the riding has predominantly been held by the Liberals and NDP. Liberal Bruce Crozier held the riding from 1999 to 2011, and then Taras Natyshak of the NDP held it from 2011 to 2022. The Essex riding takes in the communities of Amherstburg, Essex, LaSalle, Kingsville and most of Lakeshore (everything west of Rochester Townline Road) as it sprawls across 2,272 square kilometres.

"PCs win big, but miss local sweep; Analysis NDP's Gretzky hangs on to Windsor West as Essex, Windsor-Tecumseh stay blue",2025,"It was the big prize Doug Ford wanted in this election but couldn't have. The Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader rolled to a third consecutive majority Thursday, once again taking Essex and Windsor-Tecumseh along with him. But he failed to make it a local hat trick. In Windsor West, NDP Lisa Gretzky comfortably fought off PC candidate Tony Francis, hanging on to the last riding west of London that isn't Tory territory. Gretzky increased her vote total from the last Ontario election in 2022, despite polls going into election day putting her neck-andneck with Francis. ""I was hearing something completely different from the polls,"" Gretzky told reporters Thursday night. ""What we saw tonight, the vote, I think is really the most important goal, and sends a very strong message to Doug Ford and the conservatives."" ""I think the people in Windsor West, they showed Doug Ford that you can't take the people here for granted,"" Gretzky added. ""I got a stronger mandate than last election."" The PC Party made an aggressive push in recent elections for union endorsements and labour votes in Windsor-Essex, eating away at the NDP's traditional base. After taking Essex and Windsor-Tecumseh from the NDP in the last election, Ford kicked off his 2025 campaign in Windsor West, stating his party was gunning for Gretzky. Ford made repeated campaign visits to Windsor where he took several shots at Gretzky, most recently on Wednesday, the final day of campaigning, when he called her ""a lump on a log"" that ""doesn't do anything."" The insults didn't work. Gretzky took 19,392 votes (52.1 per cent), a notable jump from 2022 when she garnered 13,396 votes (46 per cent). Francis, Thursday's runner-up, received 14,665 votes (39.4 per cent). It was a different story elsewhere in Windsor-Essex, where three Conservative MPPs each won second mandates, including Trevor Jones in Chatham-KentLeamington. Andrew Dowie pulled in 48.2 per cent of the vote with 21,285 ballots cast for him in Windsor-Tecumseh. The NDP runner-up, Gemma Grey-Hall, received 13,721 votes (31 per cent). ""The last couple years I've been learning the ropes at Queen's Park and now I'm in overdrive to do a better job to make sure Windsor is kept on the map,"" said Dowie. ""Doug Ford knows our community. The relationship with the United States is something he knows is important to us."" In Essex, Anthony Leardi collected 30,785 votes (55.5 per cent), more than doubling the totals of NDP runner-up Rachael Mills, who received 12,047 votes (21.7 per cent). Leardi also noted tense relations with the U.S., saying his boss's call for a snap election was the right move. Ford, who already had a majority government, called an election 16 months ahead of schedule, arguing he needed a new mandate to deal with the Trump administration and its threats of punishing trade tariffs. ""I think it was necessary to show the Americans that our government is going to be around just as long as Donald Trump, if not longer,"" said Leardi. ""This was absolutely necessary, and it had to be done."" Given the incumbents' name recognition, lack of major contenders, and the PCs riding high in pre-election polls, Essex and Windsor-Tecumseh had been expected to stay blue. Ford's early election gamble, and hammering home that he is best equipped to deal with Trump, paid off in those ridings as it did across most of Ontario. But from the start, Windsor West was touted as a riding to watch. Gretzky had incumbent status, labour support, and a track record for voters to judge her on. And the Liberal candidate withdrew, likely giving Gretzky a boost with left-leaning voters. Another factor that may have gone in Gretzky's favour: Unless Francis knocked on their door, Windsor West voters didn't see much of him throughout the 28day campaign. ""I would have liked to have done more discussion in public,"" Francis told the Star when asked on election night whether he would have done anything different. Francis, Dowie, and Leardi all followed a provincewide PC protocol to avoid debates, media questions, and other public forums during this election. But Leardi and Dowie had incumbent status on their side and the ridings they represent also boast heavy rural populations, which are more likely to vote conservative. Francis was a newcomer candidate with less name recognition. But he said the edict to stay lowkey came from the top. ""It's a team sport, right? That was the strategy at the time,"" said Francis. ""There's a lot of smart people and they decided that was a strategy to apply. ""So, you either believe in the team or you don't believe in the team."" twilhelm@postmedia.com","The Windsor Star; Windsor, Ont.","Windsor, Ont.","Wilhelm, Trevor",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 1, 2025",Political campaigns; Voters; Elections,,2025-03-01,The Windsor Star
NDP's Gretzky secures Windsor West once again; Longtime MPP holds only NDP seat west of London with fourth win in a row,2025,"Windsor West NDP MPP Lisa Gretzky will return to Queen's Park after winning a fourth consecutive provincial election victory and maintaining the only orange seat west of London. Unofficial election results show Gretzky garnered 19,392 votes Thursday night (52.1 per cent), besting Progressive Conservative runner-up Tony Francis, who received 14,665 votes (39.4 per cent). ""I think the people of Windsor West, they showed Doug Ford that you can't take the people here for granted,"" Gretzky told reporters between cheers and applause from supporters at her campaign headquarters. ""They've shown Doug Ford that's what's important here is health care, a strong publicly funded, publicly delivered health-care system, that they want investments in your public education system, and that, over seven years of Doug Ford, costs have only gone up. People here in Windsor West have shown that they're ready and really wanted to have a fgi hter back at Queen's Park."" Heading back to Ontario's Legislative Assembly with even fewer NDP counterparts by her side - though forming the official opposition - Gretzky said she will continue to do what she's ""always done, which is listen to the residents of Windsor West, fight for the things that matter to them, and to stand up to Doug Ford, rather than do what Doug Ford tells me to do."" Just over 38 per cent of the 96,825 registered voters in Windsor West cast a ballot this election, an increase from 2022, when voter turnout was 33.6 per cent. Given the overwhelming PC majority, Francis said he believes Windsor West would have been better off with a ""seat at the table."" ""It's like a large corporation,"" Francis told the Star after the results came in. ""If you're not at the decision making table, you don't get the piece of the pie. And I'm sur - prised how many people don't understand that. I wanted to give Windsor West a piece of the pie instead of the status quo. But she ran a good campaign. She hit all the right buttons that people wanted, and you've got to give a credit for that."" Francis, who made his first run for office with this election, suggested he might have done better if the campaign had been longer. ""We put a great team together,"" he said. ""I wish I had more time for people to get to know me. It is what it is. But I love the city, and I want the city to be well, to progress and move forward."" In 2022, Gretzky held on to the riding with 13,395 votes (42.1 per cent), outlasting the PC runner-up John Leontowicz by 2,184 votes. In the 2018 election, Gretzky captured 52.1 per cent of the vote (20,276), nearly double the next closest candidate, who was PC Adam Ibrahim. Since the riding as it exists today was created 26 years ago, it has been held by only Liberals and New Democrats. The Liberals did not have a candidate in Windsor West this election. The Liberals held Windsor West from 1999, when it was redrawn, until Gretzky defeated Liberal cabinet minister Teresa Piruzza in 2014. Between 1967 and 1975, the NDP held the riding, which then had different boundaries, before it was dissolved and remapped into Windsor-Sandwich and Windsor-Walkerville, which no longer exists.

Nickel Belt returns France Gelinas for seventh consecutive term; NDP stalwart says fighting on behalf of public health care will be her main mission,2025,"Some people didn't even know there was an election happening on Thursday, or where to vote, but the ones who did find their way to a polling station in Nickel Belt definitely recognized the name France Gelinas on the ballot and the work the veter- an politician has done over the course of nearly two decades now to represent them. The NDP member was returned with 48.4 per cent of the vote, and will return to Queen's Park for a seventh consecutive term. Polls had suggested a tight race between Gelinas and PC rival Randy Hazlett, but in the end it wasn't really that close. The incumbent garnered 17,123 votes to Hazlett's 12,629 - nearly 4,500 more than the challenger. It was, admittedly, a smaller margin of victory than the last time the two squared off. In 2022, Gelinas earned 50.77 per cent of the vote, compared to 29.86 per cent for Hazlett. This time he marshalled 35.7 per cent. But the NDPer wasn't too fazed by that. She raised her arms in the air when the seat was (yet again) declared hers, and embraced supporters who had joined her at Cousin Vinny's in Hanmer to watch the results roll in. ""Everybody here worked really, really hard,"" she told the jubilant group. ""An election is a team sport, and I have the best team possible. We had 29 really tough days to get to today, but it pays off and thank you for all your help. It's because of you that we won."" Gelinas was also thrilled to see that her colleague Jamie West prevailed in the Sudbury riding and that the NDP retained its status of official opposition, despite predictions by some pollsters that neither would be the case. But she wasn't particularly surprised. ""We had a meeting every day where all the (NDP) candidates from the 124 ridings came together,"" she said. ""We follow the polls, just like everybody else, but you also have a feel on the ground as to how are things going, and for many of them, things were looking pretty good."" The party did lose a handful of ridings, and narrowly missed out on gaining one in the Sault, where thousands of people have lost a family physician, but Gelinas said she is ready to bring a strong voice again to Queen's Park and fight for the issues she feels are most important to people in Nickel Belt and beyond. That includes pushing back against U.S. bullying but also holding the PC government accountable on matters like health care, housing and affordability. ""As much as tariffs are a life-changing thing for many, many businesses, I'm worried that our medicare system will not survive another majority PC government,"" said Gelinas, who has served as health critic for her party. ""The privatization ofhealth care will be devastating for the great majority of Ontarians the rich will get better, faster access, and the rest will suffer. This is their plan, and it's really hard for me, because medicare defines us as Canadians, who get our care based on our needs, not our ability to pay."" She said she will fight this agenda every step of the way, and is hoping enough people will take to the streets and make their voices heard to ensure the Doug Ford government can't dismantle public health care, even if it has the balance of votes in the legislature to move many things forward. ""If we speak loud enough, and we all want the same thing, we will get it,"" she said. ""We pushed back against the Greenbelt, and we won. We pushed back when they wanted to take away the rights of education workers and we won. But you really have to get organized with one voice, and be loud."" While she was pleased with the outcome for herself, West and other social democrats, Gelinas said Ontarians should still have questions about the way the election was sprung on them. ""Ilive in Whitefish, and I didn't get my voter's card until today,"" she said. ""Elections Ontario did the best they could, but it took time to get them to Foleyet, Gogama or Biscotasing, where the mail only comes once a week - everywhere I called and talked to people, not an hour would go by that I wouldn't have somebody that didn't know there was an election. To me, the whole thing felt like voter suppression."" jmoodie@postmedia.com","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.","Moodie, Jim",Postmedia Network Inc.,,Public health; Medicare; Elections,,,Sudbury Star
"Like the rest of the province, northeastern Ontario backs the PCs; Doug Ford took five of the region's eight ridings and the NDP three",2025,"While Sudbury and Nickel Belt voters stuck with NDP orange, much of northeastern Ontario stayed or went PC blue on Thursday. At the end of the night, the PCs held five of the region's provincial seats and the NDP three. The Liberals and Greens were shut out. Overall, Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives won Ontario's snap provincial election Thursday with Ford speaking about the need to fight U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs at nearly every turn on the campaign trail. Just days later those threats may become reality, as Trump has said 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods will be imposed starting Tuesday. The Progressive Conservative seat count is largely unchanged, with 80, while the NDP will again form the official Opposition with a somewhat smaller caucus than before the election, at 27 seats. In 2022, the Tories won 83 seats while the NDP took 31. The biggest change of the night was for the Liberals, who won 14 seats, enough to regain official party status for the first time since 2018 - but Leader Bonnie Crombie did not win a seat. Closer to home, the PCs took Algoma-Manitoulin long held by the NDP as Bill Rosenberg, Thessalon's mayor, cruised to an easy victory. Rosenberg's victory ended 13 years of representation of the riding by Michael Mantha, who collected 3,238 votes or 12 per cent of all votes cast. Mantha was removed from the NDP caucus in spring 2023 following allegations of workplace misconduct. He ran this time as an independent. The Progressive Conservatives haven't held the riding since John Lane ended a 16-year run in 1987. The Sault Ste. Marie riding provided one of the most dramatic races Thursday night. PC Chris Scott beat NDP candidate Lisa Vezeau-Allen by just 118 votes. Vezeau-Allen said she was not ready to concede. With such a narrow victory margin, Scott promised supporters that he will earn the trust of all constituents ""by showing up and doing my job."" ""Myjob is not for the 13,000 that voted for me. It's for everybody in Sault Ste. Marie."" The Sault riding has been held by PC MPP Ross Romano since 2017. Two northeastern Ontario cabi- net ministers - Vic Fedeli (Nipissing) and George Pirie won easily Thursday. Fedeli, who was the minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade in Premier Doug Ford's last cabinet, said he's ready to get back to work. ""You heard a lot about Donald Trump over the campaign,"" he told supporters in North Bay in a victory speech. ""This is a very serious threat to Ontario and to Canada. ""You've heard me say we're at war with the United States, it's an economic war, we're in the middle of a very serious war. I'm just not sure everyone is really prepared for."" Pirie told his supporters in Timmins much the same thing. He called the election ""the most important in the province's history,"" due to the looming American tariff threat. Ontario's mines minister told the crowd that Ford is the leader most capable of weathering that potential political storm. Graydon Smith held onto ParTy Sound-Muskoka for the PCs, despite a stiff challenge from the Green Party. And Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke stayed PC and elected Billy Denault, 24. As for the NDP, it held on to Timiskaming-Cochrane and to Mushkegowuk-James Bay, where Guy Bourgouin was re-elected but just by four votes, so a recount there is in the works. John Vanthof's victory in Timiskaming-Cochrane was more decisive - he beat the PC candidate by 1,613 votes. ""When the snap election was called, obviously the ballot box question was tariffs and trade,"" John Vanthof told his supporters in Timiskaming-Cochrane. ""We were in for a fight. We did everything we could to try and put a focus on an issue that is often ignored in the legislature and that is northern highway safety, and I think we did a good job focusing people on that issue. ""We did enough of a job that the premier showed up in our riding to try and change people's minds on what they have been missing on highway safety, and I think that is what brought us over the top here."" - with files from Postmedia and Canadian Press sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca Bluesky: @sudburystarbsky social X: @SudburyStar","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 1, 2025",Provincial elections; Political campaigns; Elections; Tariffs,,2025-03-01,Sudbury Star
"Goodell Ugalde proud of his campaign, strides made by NDP",2025,"Even though they lost the riding of Kingston and the Islands Thursday night, NDP supporters were upbeat after it was declared that the party retained its position as the official opposition. For first-time candidate Elliot Goodell Ugalde, the month-long campaign was a positive experience even though he couldn't repeat the party's success of 2018, when Ian Arthur became the riding's first NDP MPP in 28 years. Goodell Ugalde, a PhD candidate in political science at Queen's University, said he knocked on ""thousands of doors"" during the course of the campaign and found ""the community was very receptive."" ""I found people were interested in talking. There is asort of dissuasion with the political climate, for: variety of reasons, but I'm used to talking to people,"" Goodell Ugalde recalled in an interview after joining his supporters at the RCHA Club before the polls closed on Thursday night. ""I come from union work, so I'm better with a megaphone than I am a microphone, which has benefits but also drawbacks."" Goodell Ugalde believes that many of the constituents sup- ported the cause rather than him personally. ""I don't think it's so much support for me as it is for a movement that is resolute in fghting the fght that needs to be fought, because after 30 years of Liberal and Conservative governance, we see ourselves in the midst of a series of crises,"" he said. ""We have the opioid crisis, the right inflation crisis, the health-care crisis, the affordability crisis, the food insecurity crisis and the environmental crisis - the list goes on and on and on."" In hindsight, he said he and the local NDP would have preferred some ""forewarning about the writ being dropped."" He was in the midst of mobilizing unionized workers for potential strikes and helping prepare for a national election when the provincial election was called. ""So we sort of scrambled to put. team together, and we did,"" Goodell Ugalde said. ""The community came together, which I'm very pleased and grateful for that."" After it was declared that Hsu would be returning to Queen's Park, Goodell Ugalde stood up and thanked his supporters, and they, in turn, stood up and thanked him for running. He said preparations for the next election ""begin tomorrow."" Asked how he felt after the votes were counted, he remained undeterred.

NDP's excuses on ER closures wearing thin,2025,"The B.C. Conservatives used question period Thursday to dramatize the repeated closures of emergency rooms at provincial hospitals, in a way that was as simple as it was effective. Opposition MLAs, 20 of them in all, each asked a single question about ER closures in communities across the province: Burns Lake, Merritt, Keremeos, Lillooet, Mackenzie, Clearwater, Fort St. James, Arrow Lakes. All in, they cited a staggering 1,407 closures, of various lengths in days, at 20 hospitals over the past two years of Premier David Eby's government. Each question was capped with a challenge to Premier David Eby to explain why that is acceptable health care for B.C. Eby didn't rise to the bait, not even once. Instead, he left the responses to Health Minister Josie Osborne. After all, what are cabinet ministers for, if not to take the heat for the government's record? The handoff meant Osborne had to fall back on an increasingly weary set of deflections and excuses. She tried sympathy: ""Any time an emergency room is temporarily closed, where people need to be diverted to the closest place, is a very serious issue. I know that people want to have confidence in the system to know that the emergency services are there for them when they need it."" She drew on personal experience: ""I understand, as a member of a small community myself. I live in Tofino. We are so fortunate to have a hospital there, and I can imagine what it would feel like for my community members to know that they cannot go to the emergency room in Tofino, that they would have to drive all the way to Port Alberni."" She tried outreach: ""When the emergency room closed in Delta last week, it was really hard for people to take. I spoke to the mayor myself and he certainly reflected the concerns that he is hearing from his constituents."" She blamed forces national and international: ""We are experiencing a lot of strain in the health-care system right now. We have a global shortage of health-care workers, and that's why it's incumbent on us to do everything possible to train and recruit new doctors to our province, to hire more nurses and more health-care workers."" She cited NDP steps to fix the problem - fast tracking the recruitment of foreign doctors, establishing community health centres, building a new medical school - some of which will take months, some years. She claimed the government is making progress: ""We do know that the number of emergency room closures has come down 40 per cent over the last six months."" She did not provide the data, unlike the Conservatives, whose research department released a comprehensive record of all the closures. She suggested the Conservatives were not helping one bit: ""We have canvassed many different communities across B.C. in today's question period. I didn't hear any ideas from the Opposition."" This from a government that boosted health-care funding by $16 billion, almost 80 per cent, over seven years in office. The NDP also claims to have added 45,000 health-care workers, all the while blaming every closure on lack of resources, staff shortages and problems it inherited from the previous government. Sometimes Osborne dropped the ball, as when she said ""if you live in Elkford, you need to know that the emergency room is there for you and that our health-care system is here for you."" Not really: The ER in Elkford has been closed for two years. She stumbled a second time when she said, when closures happen, ""it's so important to work closely with the B.C. Emergency Health Services, of course, in ensuring that paramedics in ambulances know when a diversion is there because we want, of course, to ensure that people get to care as quickly as possible when they need it."" Bad example. When the ER at Delta hospital closed last weekend, the ambulance paramedics complained that they weren't given any notice. Instead they learned about the closure from a posting on X, the social media platform, just as the service was going into a shift change. The Delta closure came at a time of transition for the parent Fraser Health Authority, the board of the health region having just pushed CEO Dr. Victoria Lee out the door. The government news release tried to frame it as a mutual decision. But it also said Dr. Lee departed ""effective immediately."" I gather negotiations are underway for a severance package of more than $500,000, which scarcely suggests that the departure was her idea. The changeover prompted a rare public statement this week by Jim Sinclair, the longtime labour leader who chairs the board at Fraser Health. He's held the post since the NDP took office in 2017, establishing a reputation as a hands-on overseer. ""There are some issues that have to be dealt with,"" Sinclair conceded to reporters Wednesday. ""We are looking at the future to fix these issues and move forward."" ""I don't point fingers at anybody,"" he said, having done just that by presiding over the board's ouster of Lee. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 28, 2025",Emergency medical care; Paramedics; Community,,2025-02-28,The Vancouver Sun
B.C.'s golden oppor tunity; EBY'S NDP Government pivots to embrace the mining sector,2025,"Deep in deficit, wrestling with a stalled economy and under the threat of American tariffs, B.C.'s eco-focused New Democratic government has turned to an unlikely economic ally: the mining sector. Premier David Eby has peppered his speeches over the past two months with support for new and expanded mines. His government is poised to introduce legislation within weeks to fast-track at least four major mining projects, with the rationale they' ll generate much-needed jobs and revenue. ""The success of our natural resource sector, the mining sector and your success as prospectors is key to the success of our province as a whole,"" Eby told the Association for Mineral Exploration (AME) Roundup conference on Jan. 23. ""I believe we're at a watershed moment as a country, and certainly a key moment in the province, where there is a consensus about the need to accelerate to ensure we're developing these resources so we ensure prosperity for a country as a whole."" In his latest cabinet, Eby created a dedicated Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals with a mandate to reduce the average 10-year environmental approval process for a new mine to a new globally competitive timeline, and then enshrine that in legislation as a guarantee for investors. In his throne speech last week, the premier described mining and natural resources as ""foundational to the success of our province"" and part of a new approach to ""unlock the incredible potential here in British Columbia."" It is, to put it mildly, quite a pivot for the B.C. New Democrats. Until recently, most NDP MLAs had never even seen a mine. Almost all the party's seats are located in urban Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island, far away from the interior and northern communities where mines are located. The NDP had for years lumped mining in with forestry and natural gas as a dirty relic of the province's past, not aligned with a future of renewable energy, land protection, Indigenous reconciliation and aggressive climate goals. But several separate threads have come together to flip that dramatically. B.C. has a wealth of critical minerals, including silver, copper, nickel, cobalt and molybdenum. Its ""golden triangle"" of mining and exploration northwest of Stikine is home to much of the country's copper reserves, and a massive amount of gold. Eby began noticing the industry in mid-2023, when then-U.S. president Joe Biden introduced a $500-billion investment in clean technology such as solar panels, electric vehicles and wind turbines. Biden cited Canada's abundance of critical minerals vital to building the needed electronics, batteries and circuitry, saying the country could be a great partner to replace the unreliable and hostile China. In response, Eby started work on a new critical minerals strategy. Two years later and it is now the Americans, under President Donald Trump, who have become the unreli- able and hostile partner. Eby has moved to use critical minerals as counter-leverage, citing things like germanium. The U.S. military needs it for night vision goggles, but China has banned any exports to the U.S. The only other source is at a smelter in Trail, B.C., operated by Teck Resources. ""If the U.S. doesn't get germanium from Canada, it can't get it anywhere,"" Eby threatened in January. Mining has grown into a key pillar of B.C.'s response to Trump. ""We have a huge advantage here in British Columbia with our geographic positioning,"" Eby said earlier this month. ""With the instability that the Americans seem committed to create in the global economy, is an opportunity for us to build new relationships and to offer that stable, responsible, consistent supply of critical minerals, metals and other materials around the world. ""We know that we have what the world needs, and we're going to use that to our advantage to strengthen our economy here at home and strengthen the Canadian economy as a whole."" The sheer economic impact of mining is another subtext for the B.C. NDP's sudden support. The Eby administration has run the government from an almost $6-billion surplus in 202323 to a projected record $9.5-billion deficit in 202425. B.C. has 17 proposed mining projects on the books, with the potential to bring in $36 billion in investment, $11 billion in tax revenue and $23 billion in labour income for workers. Mining represents an economic life-raft for provincial New Democrats in an ocean of red ink. Still, the abrupt pivot in the third term of government runs the risk of clashing with the NDP's earlier priorities for a nation-leading pollution reduction climate plan, and Indigenous consultation and consent on natural resource projects. Already, environmental groups and Indigenous leaders have warned that fast-tracking mines can't come at the expense of both previous commitments. In addition, the mineral exploration sector is decrying the government's new mineral staking system, which requires First Nations consultation and could reduce the exploration required for new mines. It's calling for a change before the new rules come into effect in late March. In the meantime, the Eby government appears to be going full steam ahead on its larger mining goals. The premier told the sector in a speech last month that he's prepared to tackle the Indigenous consultation and environmental issues to help it grow at a record pace. ""I want to tell you that is a core priority for every minister, for every mandate letter, it is a focus,"" Eby said. ""We need to grow our economy, we need to expedite permits, we need to get metals and minerals out of the ground.""

Ontario Election 2025: NDP's Pasma re-elected in Ottawa West-Nepean,2025,"The NDP's Chandra Pasma handily defeated four contenders to retain her seat in Ottawa West-Nepean on Thursday night. The incumbent prevailed convincingly over candidates who were running for office for the first time, namely Progressive Conservative candidate Husien Abu-Rayash, Liberal hopeful Brett Szmul, the Green Party's Sophia Andrew-Joiner and Rylan Vroom of the New Blue Party. Shortly after 9:30 p.m., a half-hour after polls closed, Pasma was declared the winner. Until then, as the votes were being tallied, Pasma consistently held a 50-per-cent share of the votes cast, more than the combined votes of her Conservative and Liberal rivals. Pasma had 20,088 votes, just under 50 per cent of the vote, while Abu-Rayash was second with 11, 697 votes. Szmul had 7,229 votes while neither Andrew-Joiner nor Vroom had more than 1,000 votes. At the Barley Mow on Merivale Road, dozens of NDP supporters greeted Pasma with loud cheers when she arrived shortly before 10 p.m. ""What an honour. I am so grateful to the people of Ottawa West for putting their trust in me once again,"" she told the crowded pub. ""Together, our community has rejected Doug Ford's bad deals and his wasteful scandals and they have instead opted for a hopeful, positive vision of our province,"" she said. ""A province where everyone has a family doctor and gets the healthcare that they need, a province where everyone has a home they can afford and can put groceries on the table. A home where all of our children have a safe, healthy school and the supports that they need to learn. Where we stand together and build a more resilient province."" Spirits were high at Abu-Rayash's College Square watch party, with attendees chatting and smiling for photos, even as Pasma was projected to win. Husien Abu-Rayash smiles at his College Square watch party. ""It was a really good race for all teams,"" Abu-Rayash said. Elissa Mendes, Postmedia Just one TV at Chances R displayed the latest on the election - the other two showed the Oilers-Panthers game instead. A metres-long spread of food was mostly untouched by 9:30 p.m. as attendees checked their phones, watching the results come in. ""It was a really good race for all teams,"" Abu-Rayash said with a smile, as Pasma's win was solidified. ""I'm also grateful for all the people who went out to vote in this amazing election,"" he said. ""Everyone just wanted to go out and give our government a new mandate."" Abu-Rayash said he's thankful for the support he received from volunteers and his Canadian Armed Forces colleagues. ""We got a new mandate, but at the same time, we will be continuing to fight for all Ontarians across the province,"" he said. Asked whether he plans to run again in the future, Abu-Rayash said ""you never know."" A campaign manager for Abu-Rayash, who requested anonymity - saying he works in counter-terrorism - said questions must be focused on the campaign rather than specific issues. Abu-Rayash opted for a muted campaign, with no debates and a limited social media presence, because ""the policies and proposed mandate for the coming term was already defined,"" the campaign manager said. Debates ""just takes away from time for the candidates to be at the door meeting their supporters,"" the campaign manager added. Chaouki Dehane, an 18-year-old University of Ottawa student said ""I think the Conservative party sees the value in spending money in the right places."" Dehane lives downtown but showed up to support the Ottawa West-Nepean PC candidate. ""I think we need a strong voice who's already been in power and knows how the system works to fight Trump's tariffs,"" he said of Ford. On his LinkedIn account, Abu-Rayash described himself as ""a lifelong Conservative and community leader with over 10 years of political organizing and volunteering experience."" He has a bachelor's degree in public administration and governance from Toronto Metropolitan University. His profile on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter, describes him as ""a proud father of four daughters and one son, raising his children in Nepean"" and a former reservist officer with the Canadian Armed Forces. In January, Abu-Rayash sought the PC nomination in the riding of Nepean, after its incumbent, long-time MPP Lisa MacLeod, decided not to run for re-election. But Abu-Rayash wound up running in the neighbouring riding of Ottawa West-Nepean. Liberal candidate Szmul is a student at Carleton University pursuing a master's degree in international affairs. Both Abu-Rayash and Andrew-Joiner skipped the Rogers TV debate for Ottawa West-Nepean candidates. Abu-Rayash also declined to answer an Ottawa Citizen questionnaire sent to all candidates. Pasma improved on her showing in 2022. That spring, she won a nail-biter when she beat Jeremy Roberts, the PC incumbent, by a little more than 1,000 votes out of more than 91,000 votes cast. In the 2018 provincial election, it was Roberts who triumphed over Pasma by the narrowest of margins, winning 16,590 votes to Pasma's 16,415. That year, former Ottawa mayor Bob Chiarelli ran for the Liberals, but with a tally of 14,810 votes, he trailed behind Roberts and Pasma. The back-to-back wins for Pasma and the NDP chart a new direction for Ottawa West-Nepean, which was created in 1999. The provincial riding has voted Liberal for most of its 25-year existence. Jim Watson held the seat from 2003 to 2010, after which the former Ottawa mayor was again elected as the city's mayor from 2010 to 2022. Chiarelli, who had been Ottawa's mayor from 2001 to 2006, represented Ottawa West-Nepean provincially from 2010 to 2018. Two Progressive Conservatives have represented the riding - Gary Guzzo from 1999 to 2003 and Roberts from 2018 to 2022. At the federal, Liberal MP Anita Vandenbeld has held the seat for Ottawa West-Nepean since 2015. According to the 2021 census, the riding was then home to 116,409 people, of whom nine out of 10 are English speakers. Bordered by the Ottawa River and Hunt Club Road, Kanata and Bells Corners and the Rideau River, the riding is largely suburban, but also rural communities to the west.

Chris Selley: Ontario's Liberals and NDP failed miserably at the one job they had,2025,"Some of us thought Doug Ford might be playing with fire by calling an election in the middle of a crisis - especially since it was so obvious for so long that he (or at least some of his senior advisers) had been eager for any pretext to go early. Either there wasn't any fire, or the opposition parties utterly failed to harness it. The networks called it eight minutes after the polls closed: A third PC majority. It's not the colossal majority it seemed they might be able achieve; more like status quo, including an NDP official opposition and the fact that Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie doesn't have a seat (though she improbably vowed Thursday night to stay on in her job). But status quo was good enough for the Tories beforehand, and it's good enough now. Ford said he needed ""a strong, stable, four-year mandate that will outlive and outlast the Trump administration,"" and to the extent ""mandates"" mean anything in parliamentary democracies, he has it. It's a remarkable achievement: The last person to win three straight majorities at Queen's Park was Ford's Progressive Conservative predecessor, Leslie Frost, in the 1950s. No one has won four since Ontario was a de-facto two-party system. It's especially remarkable since the last time a pollster inquired after the popularity of Canada's premiers, in December, the Angus Reid Institute found just 34 per cent of respondents approved of Ford - less than any of his colleagues. Yet hardly anyone landed a glove on him in a month of campaigning. Amid the forthcoming recriminations, this may come to be seen as a remarkable achievement in itself. It stood to reason that health care might be the Tories' Achilles' heel, if they had one. They promised to ""end hallway medicine"" seven years and two elections ago, and as Crombie repeatedly and pithily observed, they ""didn't get it done."" In September, based on data released through access-to-information, provincial news site The Trillium reported ""nearly 2,000 patients per day on average (in January 2024) were kept in unconventional spaces in hospitals across the province"" - ""unconventional space"" being the charming pseudonym for ""using a chamber pot in a public hallway."" Ontario election 2025: Doug Ford wins third straight majority government Michael Taube: Doug Ford seals legacy on path to forever premier That number was the highest since Ontario Health began collating data in 2017, and it well after COVID-19 had knocked the system on its keester. Ford's plan to fix primary health care after seven years - the state of which is directly connected to the state of our emergency rooms - landed mere hours before the election was called; he only appointed Dr. Jane Philpott to head up that plan in October In the final days of the campaign, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ford inveighed against Ontarians who go to hospital for minor ailments ""Fifty per cent of the people shouldn't be in (there),"" he said, citing an unnamed ER doc as his source for that figure. ""You got a little scrape on your knee or whatever, they should be at a clinic down the street."" This was a brave gambit, considering many people lucky enough to have signed on with a family doctor are contractually prohibited from seeking care at unaffiliated walk-in clinics - a leading absurdity of ""universal health care"" in Ontario.. But look at what pollster Leger found in a survey for Postmedia, released 10 days ago After seven years of, shall we say, very mixed results, Ford was essentially tied with Crombie as the party leader respondents felt was best qualified to improve health care - 23 per cent for Ford, 22 per cent for Crombie. ""I don't know (who would be best)"" was way out in front at 36 per cent. Indeed, on six of the nine issues Leger presented, the number of respondents who said they didn't know which leader would do best exceeded the number who chose any of the actual leaders. The exceptions: On ""growing Ontario's economy,"" Ford pipped ""I don't know"" 37 per cent to 36, with Crombie a distant third at 16 per cent. On reducing gridlock, Ford was in front at 41 per cent, with ""I don't know"" in second at 38 per cent and the Liberals barely registering at 12 per cent. And on ""defend(ing) Ontario's interests from aggressive U.S. trade and economic policies,"" Ford's unabashed anti-Trump rhetoric and ""Captain Canada"" persona seem to have done the trick: 45 per cent felt Ford was the right person for the job, with ""I don't know"" at 32 per cent and the others at just 22 per cent combined. Polls suggested the economy writ large (which certainly includes gridlock), and the threat of a bedlamite American president messing with said economy were very much top of Ontarians' minds. Federally, at least now, that seems to be favouring the incumbent party: Polls are narrowing between the Conservatives and Liberals. That may well have happened in Ontario as well, especially given the central problem with this election: The frankly ludicrous lack of disagreement between parties on the major issues listed above. What do we do about the economy? Spend, spend, spend! What do we do about Trump? Fight, fight fight! Retaliate with our own tariffs! Protect dairy farmers above all others! What do we do about gridlock? Ford says let's build new highways, including his quixotic tunnel-under-Highway-401 plan The opposition parties say, in essence, ""don't build new highways, and your tunnel plan is crazy,"" and it shouldn't be surprising if that didn't grab commuters by the lapels and shake them. If the opposition really believed in the evils of induced demand - the phenomenon whereby gridlock expands to fill the space available to it - then they would support tolls, congestion charges and other forms of road pricing. But no one at Queen's Park will touch that with a 10-foot democracy pole, and they would probably screw up the sales pitch even if they dared try. There's another very basic problem here, too: Even after seven years, Ford's Progressive Conservative party lives rent-free in the heads of the Liberals and NDP. They consider Ford, quite simply, ultra vires. They don't understand why people vote for him. They think it's bananas, and at some point people will realize that. On Wednesday, with the fight lost and the last press conference over, the Liberals accused Ford of taking ""his private jet"" to Miami for two hours and 17 minutes, and to Cancun for 24 hours - during which time, he mysteriously unveiled the PC party platform in Toronto. It was a stupid, petulant lie. (They were tracking a jet that he had chartered at times during the campaign, but that was being rented by other clients, as well - as is typical with private jets). It was an unfortunate coda to a Liberal campaign that is now trying to cast its third-place finish Thursday night as a significant victory.

B.C. NDP excuses on ER closures across the province wearing thin,2025,"VICTORIA - The B.C. Conservatives used question period Thursday to dramatize the repeated closures of emergency rooms at provincial hospitals, in a way that was as simple as it was effective. Opposition MLAs, 20 of them in all, each asked a single question about ER closures in communities across the province: Burns Lake, Merritt, Keremeos, Lillooet, Mackenzie, Clearwater, Fort St James, Arrow Lakes. All in, they cited a staggering 1,407 closures, of various lengths in days, at 20 hospitals over the past two years of Premier David Eby's government. Each question was capped with a challenge to Premier David Eby to explain why that is acceptable health care for B.C.? Eby didn't rise to the bait, not even once. Instead, he left the responses to Health Minister Josie Osborne. After all, what are cabinet ministers for, if not to take the heat for the government's record? The handoff meant Osborne had to fall back on an increasingly weary set of deflections and excuses. She tried sympathy: ""Any time an emergency room is temporarily closed, where people need to be diverted to the closest place, is a very serious issue. I know that people want to have confidence in the system to know that the emergency services are there for them when they need it."" She drew on personal experience: ""I understand, as a member of a small community myself. I live in Tofino. We are so fortunate to have a hospital there, and I can imagine what it would feel like for my community members to know that they cannot go to the emergency room in Tofino, that they would have to drive all the way to Port Alberni."" She tried outreach: ""When the emergency room closed in Delta last week, it was really hard for people to take. I spoke to the mayor myself and he certainly reflected the concerns that he is hearing from his constituents."" She blamed forces national and international: ""We are experiencing a lot of strain in the health care system right now. We have a global shortage of health-care workers, and that's why it's incumbent on us to do everything possible to train and recruit new doctors to our province, to hire more nurses and more health care workers."" She cited NDP steps to fix the problem - fast tracking the recruitment of foreign doctors, establishing community health centres, building a new medical school - some of which will take months, some years. She claimed the government is making progress: ""We do know that the number of emergency room closures has come down 40 per cent over the last six months. She did not provide the data, unlike the Conservatives, whose research department released a comprehensive record of all the closures. She suggested the Conservatives were not helping one bit: ""We have canvassed many different communities across B.C. in today's question period. I didn't hear any ideas from the Opposition."" This from a government that boosted health-care funding by $16 billion, almost 80 per cent, over seven years in office. The NDP also claims to have added 45,000 health care workers, all the while blaming every closure on lack of resources, staff shortages and problems it inherited from the previous government. Sometimes Osborne dropped the ball, as when she said ""if you live in Elkford, you need to know that the emergency room is there for you and that our health care system is here for you."" Not really: the ER in Elkford has been closed for two years. She stumbled a second time when she said, when closures happen, ""it's so important to work closely with the B.C. Emergency Health Services, of course, in ensuring that paramedics in ambulances know when a diversion is there because we want, of course, to ensure that people get to care as quickly as possible when they need it."" Bad example. When the ER at Delta hospital closed last weekend, the ambulance paramedics complained that they weren't given any notice. Instead they learned about the closure from a posting on X, the social media platform, just as the service was going into a shift change. The Delta closure came at a time of transition for the parent Fraser Health Authority, the board of the health region having just pushed CEO Dr. Victoria Lee out the door. The government news release tried to frame it as a mutual decision. But it also said Dr. Lee departed ""effective immediately."" I gather negotiations are underway for a severance package of more than $500,000, which scarcely suggests that the departure was her idea. The changeover prompted a rare public statement this week by Jim Sinclair, the longtime labour leader who chairs the board at Fraser Health. He's held the post since the NDP took office in 2017, establishing a reputation as a hands-on overseer. ""There are some issues that have to be dealt with,"" Sinclair conceded to reporters Wednesday. ""We are looking at the future to fix these issues and move forward."" ""I don't point fingers at anybody,"" he said, having done just that by presiding over the board's ouster of Lee. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related B.C.

NDP maintains status as official Opposition:   New Democrats lose a handful of ridings from 2022 election,2025,"Marit Stiles and the NDP did not come close to loosening Doug Ford's grip on a majority government Thursday night, but they did fend off a challenge from Bonnie Crombie's Liberals to maintain their status as the official Opposition. With two-thirds of the vote counted, the NDP held a comfortable advantage over the Liberals, who added enough seats to regain official party status, but otherwise endured another disappointing night. Crombie herself lost her own riding of Mississauga East-Cooksville. The NDP's famously efficient vote delivered again for the party, which trailed the Liberals in the popular vote by more than 10 percentage points while holding nearly twice as many seats. But Thursday's outcome still saw the NDP, who held 28 seats at dissolution, lose a handful of ridings, including Toronto-St. Paul's, where incumbent Jill Andrew was unseated by Liberal Stephanie Smyth. The NDP have now seen their share of votes and seats decline in consecutive elections since becoming opposition. In 2018, when Ford's Progressive Conservatives were first elected, they earned more than one-third of the popular vote and won 40 seats. They dropped to 24 per cent of the vote and 31 seats in 2022. It was an even worse outcome on Thursday, with the party on track to win 26 seats with less than 20 per cent of the popular vote. Stiles, who was acclaimed as party leader two years ago, could face more questions about her leadership after Thursday's result. The 55-year-old former school trustee and education critic has been unable to more forcefully capitalize on a weakened Liberal party and now commands an NDP caucus that is smaller than it has been since 2014. The NDP's campaign promises, which included a monthly grocery rebate, stronger rent controls, removing tolls from Highway 407 and uploading 50 per cent of municipal transit costs, didn't resonate with most voters. Or maybe they simply didn't register. Despite being opposition leader for the last two years, Stiles continues to suffer from a lack of name recognition. In a survey of more than a thousand Ontarians conducted less than two weeks ago, nearly one-third of respondents said they didn't know who Stiles was. Whatever the NDP promised, it may not have been enough to counter the strong sentiment among the electorate that Doug Ford was in the best position to defend the province against U.S. President Donald Trump and the looming threat of widespread tariffs. In the final Abacus Data poll of the campaign, released Wednesday, two-thirds of respondents believed Ford's Progressive Conservatives were the best party ""to deal with the impact of Donald Trump."" The NDP garnered just 11 per cent support on the question. Stiles, who easily won her own Davenport riding, was often the face of political opposition to the Ford government during the Greenbelt scandal in 2023, but her attacks on Ford during the campaign - that he lacked integrity and would not help working class people - didn't stick. Jared Walker, former NDP speech writer and current vice-chair of the Broadbent Institute, said before the polls closed that a successful night for the NDP would be if they could ""flip blue ridings to orange."" The party was specifically looking to make gains in the ridings of Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Essex, Sault Ste. Marie and York South-Weston in Toronto. Most polls reported they had lost or were trailing in all four.

"NDP hangs on to Windsor West, Hamilton",2025,"The strongholds delivered for the NDP. In riding after riding around the province that had been touted as close battles with the PCs and in some cases Liberals, the NDP held their own in Thursday's election. ""We had lifelong Conservative voters who walked through the doors of our office,"" said Lisa Gretzky, the NDP's standard-bearer in Windsor West. ""It was because they were so upset with the government. They weren't buying this 'we need a stronger mandate to fight the tariffs,' "" said Gretzky, who held off a challenge from PC candidate Tony Francis. Southwest In Windsor, the PCs had eyes on knocking off Gretzky in the riding of Windsor West, but held off a challenge from Francis. With 92.9 per cent of polls reporting Gretzky had 51.8 per cent of the votes, to Francis's 39.6 per cent. Francis ran a low-key campaign for the PCs this time around, not appearing at several scheduled riding ebates. Liberal candidate Moe Chehab pulled out on the deadline day for nominations, potentially giving Gretzky a leg up. In 2022, Gretzky fended off a challenge from then-PC candidate John Leontowicz, earning 42.2 per cent of the votes to Leontowicz's 35.3. The PCs took two neighbouring ridings, Windsor-Tecumseh and Essex, from the NDP in 2022. Both PC Leader Doug Ford and NDP Leader Marit Stiles campaigned in the riding this time, with Ford even kicking off his campaign here. He ended in neighbouring Essex. Tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump have sent waves of concern through the city, one of the key areas in Canada's auto manufacturing sector. In London, where the NDP held all three seats heading into this election, the PCs and Liberals had hopes of making inroads, but they appeared to be dashed as the city remained orange. In London-Fanshawe, the longtime NDP incumbent Teresa Armstrong beat PC candidate Pete Vanderley, owner of a local landscaping company. With 93.3 per cent of polls reporting, Armstrong had 47.8 per cent of the vote to Vanderley's 34.2. In 2022, Armstrong fended off a challenge from then PC candidate Jane Kovarikova, taking 47.2 per cent of the vote to Kovarikova's 32.9. In London North Centre, NDP incumbent Terence Kernaghan appeared to be holding off a challenge from PC candidate and city Coun. Jerry Pribil, with 46.9 per cent of the vote to Pribil's 32.8. Tariq Khan of the Liberals was well back in third. In London West, veteran NDP incumbent Peggy Sattler was leading long-time London District Catholic School Board principal Beth Allison of the PCs and Baqar Khan of the Liberals. Hamilton In Hamilton Centre, incumbent Independent Sarah Jama came in fourth place, with the NDP's Robin Lennox winning, beating Eileen Walker of the Liberals and PC candidate Sarah Bokhari. Jama was kicked out of the NDP caucus in October 2023, for what the party said was ""acting unilaterally too many times"" and ""undermining our work"" in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and that country's retaliatory strikes on Gaza. In an interview after polls closed, Lennox said the results showed the strength of the NDP brand. ""I didn't take anything for granted. I'm super-excited about the results,"" said Lennox. ""People in Ontario really value what is unique about the NDP. It's consistently been a progressive party that stands up for everyday people. NDP officials had been concerned about the prospect of progressive vote-splitting, with Jama still having many supporters in the riding formerly held by ex-party leader Andrea Horwath. East In the Ottawa area, the Liberals had eyes on one seat currently held by the NDP, while the PCs had hoped to be in the running for another. The PCs, meanwhile, hoped to win back a seat they lost to the Liberals in a 2023 byelection. In Ottawa Centre, NDP incumbent Joel Harden's decision to run federally had appeared to leave an opening for Liberal candidate Thomas Simpson, a former public servant and vice-president of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. Canadian Armed Forces veteran Scott Healey carried the PC banner. But with 95 per cent of polls reporting, NDP candidate Catherine McKenney, who placed a strong second in the city's 2022 mayoralty race, was romping to victory, with 55.8 per cent of the votes, to Simpson's 23.3 and Healey's 16.4. In Ottawa West-Nepean, NDP incumbent Chandra Pasma cruised past two first-time candidates, with Carleton University teaching assistant Brett Szmul running for the Liberals and former Canadian Forces member Husien Abu-Rayash running for the PCs. With 80 per cent of polls reporting, Pasma had 49.9 per cent of the vote, to Abu-Rayash's 28.4 and Szmul's 17.6. In 2022, Pasma edged out then-PC candidate Jeremy Roberts, earning 37.5 per cent of the vote to Roberts' 34.9. In Kanata-Carleton, Liberal incumbent Karen McCrimmon was leading PC candidate Scott Phelan with 47.8 per cent of the vote to Phelan's 39.8. McCrimmon won the former Tory riding in a 2023 byelection, defeating then-PC candidate Sean Webster by fewer than 1,000 votes.

They've re-elected the government, hoping it will help protect them from Donald Trump and his tariffs."" Stiles said she was prepared to offer Ford ""any possible help"" to combat the ""threat"" of Trump's presidency. ""The threat is real, and I deeply believe that we can overcome it with a strong team Ontario and a strong team Canada approach."" But, she also said she would continue to hold Ford's Progressive Conservatives accountable. ""That is a job we're going to do with our usual fight and our determination, but also with love and hope.""

Ford's winning bet:   Early election call delivers third straight majority for Progressive Conservatives Liberal leader loses bid for seat as voters return NDP to official Opposition,2025,"Doug Ford's $189-million gamble on an early Ontario election has paid off with a historic trifecta. Ford defied the odds Thursday, becoming the first premier to win three consecutive majority governments at Queen's Park since Leslie Frost in 1959. But the Progressive Conservative three-peat was tarnished by poor voter turnout of 45.4 per cent - a slight improvement from the record-low 44 per cent in June 2022 - and the fact he failed to win the ""stronger mandate"" he had sought. ""We asked the people for a mandate ... the people said yes,"" the PC leader thundered to about 200 supporters at the Toronto Congress Centre on Dixon Road in Etobicoke. Ford, who framed the campaign as a referendum on who could best cope with the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Ontario's trade-dependent economy, pledged to ""protect"" the province after a status quo result. ""Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people,"" he said. His Tories, who held 79 seats at dissolution, won or were leading in 80 of the legislature's 124 seats up for grabs, fewer than the 83 they won in 2022. Overall, the PCs received 43 per cent of the popular vote. Marit Stiles's New Democrats, benefiting from her party's superior voting efficiency, staved off a challenge from Bonnie Crombie's Liberals to remain the official Opposition in the legislature, as the NDP has been since 2018. The Liberals regained official party status, but Crombie lost her bid to win in Mississauga East-Cooksville. Still, she vowed to ""stay on"" as leader. Despite winning just 18.6 per cent of the popular vote to the Liberals' 29.9 per cent, the New Democrats won or were leading in 27 ridings to 14 for the Grits, thanks to a concentration of NDP voters in Toronto, London, Niagara and Hamilton. That the NDP finished a distant third in the popular vote and dipped from 28 seats at dissolution - losing veteran MPP Jill Andrew, who lost to Liberal Stephanie Smyth in Toronto-St. Paul's - did not faze Stiles. ""If there's one thing that we know, it's that New Democrats, our volunteers, the people who want the kind of change we're offering, they show up every time,"" she told supporters at the Great Hall on Queen Street West in Toronto. At the Mississauga Convention Centre on Derry Road, Crombie made the best of a difficult night. ""This is a building block for us,"" the former Mississauga mayor told 75 supporters after losing to PC Silvia Gualtieri, who benefited from the political machine of her son-in-law, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, a former Tory leader. It was a third electoral disappointment in a row for the Liberals, who had governed from 2003 until 2018 under premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne before being steamrollered by Ford's Tories. With a campaign that focused on Ontario's chronic doctors shortage and other health-care challenges, Crombie improved the Liberals' standing from nine seats at dissolution, meeting the threshold of 12 seats for official party status, which means more resources and staff. The Tories spent millions of dollars on attack ads against Crombie and, on the last day of the campaign, Ford brazenly descended upon Mississauga East-Cooksville to defeat her. Green Leader Mike Schreiner, whose party had two seats at dissolution, retained his Guelph riding and Aislinn Clancy's Kitchener Centre but failed to win a third in Parry Sound-Muskoka, where Tory Graydon Smith hung on. ""Together, we held Doug Ford's feet to the fire,"" Schreiner, whose Greens won 4.83 per cent, told supporters in Guelph. In Haldimand-Norfolk, Independent Bobbi Ann Brady was re-elected with 63.65 per cent of the vote, a rebuke of Ford's Tories, who had hoped to regain a traditional PC stronghold. Elections Ontario said the first winter provincial campaign since 1981 cost $189 million to run, with 55,000 temporary workers hired to staff more than 7,000 polling stations in 124 ridings. Beyond that price tag, Ford spent billions of taxpayers' money to set the table for an early election that he had been pondering since last May - long before Trump returned to office. That included $3 billion for $200 ""tax rebate"" cheques mailed to 15 million Ontario adults and children in recent weeks and $612 million to expedite the sale of beer, wine and pre-mixed cocktails in corner stores, more supermarkets and big box outlets. The Tories had promised more liberalized booze sales since 2018 and wanted to deliver on that pledge earlier than the planned date of this Dec. 31. Even though he had a majority in the legislature, Ford decided to pull the plug 15 months early, using the threat of Trump's 25 per cent tariffs - and the economic turmoil they would cause - as his rationale for seeking a renewed mandate. His rivals countered that he was rushing to face voters in order to get in front of any potential criminal charges in the ongoing RCMP investigation into the $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap scandal, which led to the departure of two cabinet ministers and two top aides. Ford had retreated from allowing development on 7,400 acres of environmentally sensitive land after damning August 2023 reports from the auditor general and the integrity commissioner concluded wealthy Tory-connected landowners had been ""favoured."" But the Mounties swept in and are still on the case. For his part, Ford has always insisted his government has ""nothing to hide"" on the Greenbelt, but his campaign advisers privately remain concerned about the RCMP probe. About a dozen current and former aides to the premier have already been interviewed by the Mounties and more will be sitting down with detectives in the coming months. Mindful that the average length of a federal police investigation is 1.6 years, the Tories, leaving nothing to chance, raced to get ahead of a probe that began in October 2023. In contrast to his largely error-free 2022 re-election campaign, Ford suffered some gaffes on the hustings, which ultimately proved inconsequential. Reverting more to the undisciplined form that marred his first two years in office, he told 1,000 people at a London Police Service gala that violent home invaders should be electrocuted even though Canada, which never used the electric chair, abolished capital punishment in 1976, replacing it with mandatory life sentences and no parole for at least 25 years. ""God forbid they kill an innocent person, I don't even go 25 years. I send 'em right to sparky and then we'll take everything from there,"" he said Jan. 29, the day the election was called. After the Star reported the remarks on Feb. 13, Ford claimed he was joking. On Feb. 3, he was caught on a ""hot mic"" in his Etobicoke campaign office saying he wanted Trump to win last November's presidential election. ""On election day, was I happy this guy won? One hundred per cent I was. Then the guy pulled out the knife and f--ing yanked it in me,"" Ford said, motioning his arm as if stabbing someone while in conversation with PC candidates David Piccini and Christine Hogarth and some firefighters. That snafu threatened to undermine his entire narrative for the early election call and the PC campaign team scrambled to do damage control. The following day, Ford complained to reporters that ""you guys are obsessed with that"" but struggled with his reasoning for wanting Trump to defeat Kamala Harris. ""Well, you know something, I always believe in working with anyone,"" he stammered. ""On the hot mic, yeah, he makes me swear. I think he makes a lot of people swear in this country."" When pressed, Ford, who had publicly criticized Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic for withholding personal protective equipment shipments to Canada, sheepishly said he thought the president would be less provocative in his second term. Voters on Thursday forgave him the transgression. In another first for an Ontario election, the premier spent more time in Washington than he did in Ottawa during the 29-day writ period - and conducted interviews with American media outlets while shunning those based at Queen's Park. He flew twice to the U.S. capital, billing a chartered jet to the PC campaign, to lobby American lawmakers about the perils of Trump's tariffs to economies on both sides of the border. Because some government resources were used on the first mission, where he delivered a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Crombie and Stiles complained he had violated the ""caretaker convention"" during an election. But with a fresh four-year mandate - unless he again decides to trigger a snap vote and go early - Ford now has the carte blanche he sought from voters to spend billions of dollars to offset any economic devastation from Trump's tariffs.

Ford's winning bet:   Early election call delivers third straight majority for Progressive Conservatives Liberal leader loses bid for seat as voters return NDP to official Opposition,2025,"Doug Ford's $189-million gamble on an early Ontario election has paid off with a historic trifecta. Ford defied the odds Thursday, becoming the first premier to win three consecutive majority governments at Queen's Park since Leslie Frost in 1959. But the Progressive Conservative three-peat was tarnished by a near-low voter turnout of about 45 per cent - echoing the June 2022 results - and the fact he failed to win the larger mandate he had sought. ""We asked the people for a mandate ... the people said yes,"" the PC leader thundered to about 200 supporters at the Toronto Congress Centre on Dixon Road in Etobicoke. Ford, who framed the campaign as a referendum on how he could best cope with the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Ontario's trade-dependent economy, pledged to ""protect"" the province. ""Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people,"" he said. His Tories, who held 79 seats at dissolution, won or were leading in 81 of the legislature's 124 seats up for grabs, but that's fewer than the 83 they won in 2022. Overall, the PCs won 42.9 per cent of the popular vote. Marit Stiles's New Democrats, benefiting from her party's superior voting efficiency, staved off a challenge from Bonnie Crombie's Liberals to remain the official Opposition in the legislature, as the NDP has been since 2018. Despite winning just 18.73 per cent of the popular vote to the Liberals' 29.66 per cent, the New Democrats won 26 ridings to 13 for the Grits thanks to its concentration of voters in Toronto, London, Niagara and Hamilton. The NDP dipped from 28 seats at dissolution. Veteran New Democrat MPP Jill Andrew lost to Liberal Stephanie Smyth in Toronto-St. Paul's. Still, at the Great Hall on Queen Street West in Toronto, Stiles's supporters were celebrating. While the Liberals regained official party status, Crombie lost her bid to win in Mississauga East-Cooksville and she vowed to ""stay on"" as leader. ""This is a building block for us,"" the former Mississauga mayor, who took the party helm in December 2023, told supporters after she lost to PC Silvia Gualtieri, who benefited from the political machine of her son-in-law, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, a former PC leader. It was a third electoral disappointment in a row for the Liberals, who had governed from 2003 until 2018 under premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne before being steamrollered by Ford's Tories. Crombie, armed with a campaign that focused on Ontario's chronic doctors shortage and other health-care challenges, improved their standing from nine seats at dissolution, meeting the threshold of 12 seats for official party status that the Grits had lacked since losing power almost seven years ago. The Tories spent millions of dollars on attack ads against her and on the last day of the campaign, Ford brazenly descended upon Mississauga East-Cooksville to defeat her. Green Leader Mike Schreiner, whose party had two seats at dissolution, retained his Guelph riding and Aislinn Clancy's Kitchener Centre but failed to win a third in Parry Sound-Muskoka, where Tory Graydon Smith hung on. ""Together, we held Doug Ford's feet to the fire,"" Schreiner told supporters in Guelph. Elections Ontario said the first winter provincial campaign since 1981 cost $189 million to run with 55,000 temporary workers hired to staff more than 7,000 polling stations in 124 ridings. Beyond that price tag, Ford spent billions of taxpayers' money to set the table for an early election that he had been pondering since last May - long before Trump returned to office. That included $3 billion for $200 ""tax rebate"" cheques mailed to 15 million Ontario adults and children in recent weeks, and $612 million to expedite the sale of beer, wine and premixed cocktails in corner stores, more supermarkets and big box outlets. The Tories had promised more liberalized booze sales since 2018 and wanted to deliver on that pledge earlier than the planned date of this Dec. 31. Even though he had a majority in the legislature, Ford decided to pull the plug 15 months early, using the threat of Trump's 25 per cent tariffs - and the economic turmoil they would cause - as his rationale for seeking a renewed mandate. His rivals countered that he was rushing to face voters in order to get in front of any potential criminal charges in the ongoing RCMP investigation into the $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap scandal, which led to the departure of two cabinet ministers and two top aides.

"Liberal gains in Toronto cost PCs, NDP",2025,"Bonnie Crombie's Liberals regained territory in Toronto on Thursday, taking seats from the PCs and NDP in a city that was a Grit stronghold before losses in the previous two elections. The result was a silver lining for the Liberal leader who failed to win her Mississauga seat or vault her party to official opposition status. Crombie's party held just four of Toronto's 25 seats going into the election, and picked up three more. PC incumbent Christine Hogarth fell in Etobicoke-Lakeshore to Liberal Lee Fairclough. Hogarth, first elected in 2018, had campaigned on issues including her party's plan to remove a portion of the Bloor Street West bike lane. This was a rematch after Fairclough lost to Hogarth by less than 900 votes in the previous election. There was another surprise in Don Valley North where incumbent Vincent Ke, a former Tory who ran as an independent, lost to Liberal Jonathan Tsao. PC candidate Sue Liu failed to win back the seat for the PCs. Former CP24 journalist Stephanie Smyth captured Toronto-St. Paul's for the Liberals, defeating NDP incumbent Jill Andrew who had represented the riding since 2018. Smyth told the Star that voters in the city ""were saying 'time for a change.'"" She said the Liberals had ""paid the dues"" in the last two elections ""and people are realizing now it's time to forge ahead"" and support the party again. ""We powered through a winter election and it was all about grit and determination,"" she added. In York South-Weston, PC candidate Mohamed Firin beat Liberal Daniel Di Giorgio by just 144 votes to replace Michael Ford, the nephew of Premier Doug Ford, who declined to run again for the PCs. The Conservatives won another open contest, in Eglinton-Lawrence, by a narrow margin. The incumbent PC MPP Robin Martin opted not to run again, and two weeks ago Liberal challenger Vince Gasparro, a finance executive who worked in former Toronto mayor John Tory's office, was given a boost when the NDP's Natasha Doyle-Merrick backed out to support him to avoid splitting the anti-Ford vote. Gasparro lost to the PC's Michelle Cooper, executive director of the Conservatives' fundraising arm, by just 167 votes. In an interview, Gasparro said ""I'm incredibly proud of my team's effort over 90 days to rebuild the party apparatus and infrastructure in the riding. The result is so close that party headquarters is advising us to ask for a recount, to make sure every vote gets allocated correctly."" Cooper said in a text: ""We knew from the beginning this would be a tough battle."" She thanked voters for ""putting their trust in me to protect Ontario."" The NDP held on to Parkdale-High Park, where Bhutila Karpoche had declined to run again as she made the leap to join the federal New Democrats. Alexa Gilmour handily won the seat, beating the Liberal challenger by more than 6,000 votes. Both major party leaders who represent Toronto ridings - the NDP's Marit Stiles in Davenport, and Doug Ford in Etobicoke North - comfortably held onto their seats. In the 2022 election, Doug Ford's party won 12 of the provincial capital's 25 seats, and the PCs were looking to build on that by painting more than half the city's ridings blue. Tom Rakocevic appeared to have held Humber River-Black Creek for the NDP after a strong challenge by PC challenger Paul Nguyen, who trailed by less than 200 votes. Barring tally changes due to recounts, the PCs locked down 10 seats in Toronto, while the NDP won eight and the Liberals seven. The NDP won nine Toronto seats in the last election. Myer Siemiatycki, a political science professor emeritus at Toronto Metropolitan University, said it appears that the Ford government took a hit for its political interventions in Toronto. Efforts to win more seats in the city failed, he noted, after the PCs closed the Science Centre, forged ahead with a controversial Ontario Place redevelopment and overruled city hall to order the removal of some bike lanes. ""It appears the Ford government paid a price in Toronto while winning a strong majority elsewhere,"" Siemiatycki said, adding that PC strength in Toronto suburbs and the 905 suggests the Liberals and NDP need to find ways to connect with non-urban voters. Re-elected MPPs included: Kristyn Wong-Tam (NDP) in Toronto Centre; Peter Tabuns (NDP) in Toronto-Danforth, Jessica Bell (NDP) in University-Rosedale; Chris Glover (NDP) in Spadina-Fort York; Raymond Cho (PC) in Scarborough North; Vijay Thanigasalam (PC) in Scarborough-Rouge Park; Stephanie Bowman in Don Valley West; Kinga Surma (PC) in Etobicoke Centre; Adil Shamji (Liberal) in Don Valley East; and Mary-Margaret McMahon (Liberal) in Beaches-East York. Toronto was a Liberal stronghold for years before Ford's PCs snapped up 11 seats in the city in 2018 as support for the Grits collapsed. That was the Tories' best showing in the city for nearly a decade. In 2022 they improved on that result by winning a twelfth riding, while the NDP took nine Toronto seats, and the Ontario Liberals won only four. The PCs lost a seat in March 2023 when Ke left the party to sit as an independent. Heading into the election, all the PC seats were in Etobicoke, North York, and Scarborough. To improve on their showing three years ago the party had to shore up open races and pick off additional ridings held by opponents.

"The 905 remains (mostly) blue:   Liberals fail to make headway in Mississauga ridings, NDP's French retains Oshawa in tight battle",2025,"The GTA suburbs stayed blue. And in a huge blow for Bonnie Crombie, the Liberal leader and former mayor of Mississauga couldn't win her hand-picked riding of Mississauga East-Cooksville. Crombie was supposed to help bring some of the 905 vote, and in particular the vote in Mississauga to her Liberal side, but she didn't have the impact some expected, where the majority of Conservative MPPs managed to hold on to their seats as Ontarians voted Thursday - despite the high-profile controversies that followed the Ford government last term. This election, all eyes were on Crombie, and her chosen seat of Mississauga East-Cooksville, where she faced off with Sylvia Gualtieri, an insurance executive and mother-in-law of Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, who was Ford's predecessor as party leader. Crombie was losing to Gualtieri by more than 1,500 votes at press time. ""I know tonight isn't exactly the result we're looking for, but you should be very, very proud of what we did tonight,"" said Crombie. ""This is a building block for us. It is a momentum that we can continue to push forward and to grow."" "" Despite Crombie's reign as a three-time mayor in Mississauga, she was unable to sway other Mississauga ridings to turn red - even though several races remained close until the end, in particular in Mississauga-Erin Mills between PC Sheref Sabawy and Liberal candidate Qasir Dar, who were separated by only 20 votes at press time with all polls reporting. A recount will be held. Historically, the GTA 905 ridings usually help determine the election - and their allegiances can change. With 30 ridings and several newcomer populations, this is where parties expect and hope to make gains, but on Thursday night, the Conservatives managed to keep their support. ""Both federally and provincially, the ring around Toronto, the 905 seats in Mississauga and Brampton, they really are almost always the tale of the tape and the most hotly contested seats. The party that wins the majority of those seats tends to be the party that forms government,"" said Scott Reid, political analyst. Reid also marvelled that Ford and the Conservatives are strategically built around success in the 905, targeting the area with issues like building highways and middle class tax relief. ""It feels like it's literally a laboratory-distilled political operation for the 905 and obviously that's paying dividends,"" said Reid. In some ways it was a case of history repeating itself, as the Conservatives managed a near clean sweep of the 905/GTA ridings in 2022, taking 29 of the 30 ridings in Peel, York and Durham regions. The lone holdout last time was the NDP's Jennifer French in Oshawa. What happened this time? This time around, Mississauga-Lakeshore incumbent Rudy Cuzetto reclaimed his seat against Elizabeth Mendes. In other races in Peel, Brampton Centre saw two former councillors face off, including incumbent PC MPP Charmaine Williams, who won easily over current Brampton Coun. Martin Medeiros, for the Liberals. In Ajax, PC incumbent Patrice Barnes won the seat for the first time in 2022 by about 1,500 votes. This time she faced new Liberal candidate Rob Cerjanec, who worked in public education and as a business consultant. Polling had the two candidates in a neck-and-neck race that made the riding a toss-up but Cerjanec was victorious, winning by 350 votes, flipping the seat. The NDP hoped to retain Oshawa, a riding that had many eyes on it, as the former Liberal candidate, Viresh Bansal, was kicked out of the party for a controversial message from 2023 celebrating the death of a Sikh Canadian who was killed. The seat has been held since 2014 by the NDP's French, but she beat the Conservative candidate by only 757 votes in 2022. This time, she faced former MPP Jerry Ouellette, who she defeated in 2014. Polls had them in a tight battle, but French held onto her seat by just under 2,000 votes. Conservatives managed to hold on to their support, despite what has appeared to be a contentious relationship with municipalities - particularly on issues around traffic, housing, homelessness and finances. Last month, Ontario's Big City Mayors Caucus held a press conference to outline their key priorities from the province for the next term, with the top three being: solving the homelessness crisis, building affordable housing and infrastructure and a new financial deal for cities. ""We can't continue to exist and plan on the 'Hunger Games' model, which is wait for a funding announcement to open up, put your application in and hope you get something - where you are all competing with each other,"" said Burlington Mayor Marianne Meed Ward, who said there has been some ""progress on these issues, but there is more that needs to be done."" In Burlington, there was an unexpectedly tight race between PC incumbent Natalie Pierre and Liberal candidate Andrea Grebenc, who only trailed by a few hundred votes for most of the night. It wasn't called at press time. The suburbs also saw the return of several Conservative cabinet ministers who presided over controversial files, like housing, education and the Greenbelt scandal last term. Most won their seats handily, not facing any type of rebuke from voters. Paul Calandra was most recently minister of municipal affairs and housing - who was brought in by Ford to mitigate the Greenbelt disaster following the resignation of former housing minister Steve Clark - won in Markham-Stouffville. Prabmeet Sarkaria has served as Minister of Transportation, while Metrolinx has lagged building new lines like the Eglinton Crosstown, and been the face of the Conservatives' controversial plan to rip up bike lanes in Toronto, and forge ahead with the controversial Highway 413. He won Brampton South handily, and was endorsed by local politicians like Brown. And Deputy Premier and Health Minister Sylvia Jones, MPP for Dufferin-Caledon who has been a MPP since 2007, and was endorsed by local Mayor Annette Groves, also won her seat despite the province's failed promise to fix ""hallway medicine"" and their contentious move toward privatization.

"FORD WINS THIRD STRAIGHT MAJORITY:   NDP to remain Official Opposition, with Liberals set to regain party status even as leader Crombie fails to secure riding",2025,"Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford has won a historic third consecutive majority government, in an election he called more than a year early to mount a campaign that focused on his vows to fight U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs. Mr. Ford had justified the vote by saying he needed a stronger mandate to face down Mr. Trump. With 99 per cent of polls reporting, results showed Mr. Ford leading or elected in 82 of the legislature’s 124 seats. His PC Party had 79 seats at Queen’s Park when he called the snap election. He said he was ready to fight for Ontario, and Canada, which he said would never become the 51st state, as Mr. Trump has threatened. “This election was about who we are, about the future we choose for ourselves,” Mr. Ford told cheering supporters at an Etobicoke convention hall. “Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region. Donald Trump doesn’t know what we know. He is underestimating us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people, the Canadian spirit.” He also repeated his vow to build a massive traffic tunnel under Highway 401, a project experts say could cost $60-billion to $120-billion. Mr. Ford’s main rivals were left far behind the PC Leader. Marit Stiles, who heads the NDP, was on track to lead her party to 25 seats, down from the 28 the NDP held when the legislature was dissolved. The result means she remains Leader of the Official Opposition. Speaking to supporters in Toronto, Ms. Stiles acknowledged that she was disappointed but vowed to hold the Ford government to account. “In another few years, we are going to face a rematch and I’m there for it my friends,” Ms. Stiles said. The Liberals, under Leader Bonnie Crombie, the former mayor of Mississauga, were leading or elected in just 14 seats in early results. And Ms. Crombie lost her bid for her first seat in the legislature in the riding of Mississauga East-Cooksville, falling to PC candidate Silvia Gualtieri. But Ms. Crombie, who won her party’s leadership in December, 2023, vowed to stay on despite the loss. She noted that the Liberals boosted their popular vote to 30 per cent, and were set to clear the 12-seat hurdle to regain official party status. “People counted us out. They said the Ontario Liberal Party was dead,” Ms. Crombie told cheering supporters in Mississauga. “Turns out they were wrong.” That result is more than the nine seats the party had when the election was called, after two consecutive drubbings at the polls in 2018 and 2022. But it leaves Ontario’s Liberals in third place. The Green Party, led by Mike Schreiner, had two seats when the election was called, and was leading or elected in two seats Thursday night. The preliminary turnout figure was around 45 per cent of eligible voters, an extremely low level compared with elections past but similar to 2022. Results in seven ridings across the province were delayed as some polls were allowed to remain open past 9 p.m., Elections Ontario said. The election result makes Mr. Ford the first Ontario premier to win three back-to-back majorities since Leslie Frost in 1959. The election, 15 months ahead of schedule, cost an estimated $189million. The room at Mr. Ford’s victory party was sparse when a PC majority was called, with a smattering of applause from the crowd. Cheers grew louder when polls showed Ms. Crombie behind in her own riding. A crowd of a few dozen Liberal supporters at the party’s election night headquarters in Mississauga watched quietly as the CBC broadcast projected a Conservative majority not long after polls closed. Many stood with arms folded in front of the screen but did not seem surprised by the result. Boos and groans echoed out at the NDP’s election party when news outlets projected a PC majority. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Mr. Ford in a statement, saying he would work with the Premier “to defend Canadian interests, protect workers and businesses, and grow our economy.” In a winter campaign hampered by snowstorms and overshadowed by events in Washington, polls had consistently shown Mr. Ford set to win a crushing victory over his rivals, even expanding his majority. In the campaign before Thursday’s vote, both Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie took aim at Mr. Ford’s move to call an early election, which took place after the government distributed $200 cheques to most residents. They accused the PC Leader of trying to get ahead of any charges that could result from the RCMP’s criminal investigation into his government’s aborted plan to allow select developers to build housing on parts of the protected Greenbelt lands. Mr. Ford maintained throughout the campaign that he needed a new mandate from the public in the face of Mr. Trump’s tariff threats and vowed to spend upward of $40-billion to protect the provincial economy. He also travelled twice to Washington to lobby U.S. lawmakers on trips the opposition dismissed as campaign photoops. His slick TV ads, which made use of his appearances on American cable TV news channels, presented him as a fighter who would stand up to the President. But while in the U.S. capital, Mr. Ford and fellow premiers lobbied various U.S. lawmakers but only met with lower-level White House staff, and came away with no guarantees that tariffs would be avoided – or that Canada would not be taken over by the U.S. Struggling to get attention amid the crisis caused by Mr. Trump, Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie ran campaigns targeting Mr. Ford on other issues, such as the struggling health care system, which has left 2.5 million Ontarians without a family doctor, and long wait times in jammed emergency rooms. The PCs promised to spend $1.8-billion to connect two million people with family physicians on the eve of the election call, something the Liberals and NDP dismissed as too little, too late. They also criticized Mr. Ford for failing to build enough housing, with housing starts in Ontario falling well behind those in some other provinces. Ms. Crombie pledged a middle-class income-tax cut, while Ms. Stiles promised a monthly rebate for low and middle-income families to offset the cost of groceries. Few of the opposition’s attacks seemed to affect support for Mr. Ford, even though he suffered from low approval ratings and was caught on camera saying he was “100-per-cent” happy when Mr. Trump was elected last November. Mr. Ford said afterward that he would never support Mr. Trump again. Heading into the vote Thursday, PC pollster Nick Kouvalis said he believed the party could win about 89 seats. The PCs had hoped to expand their support during the campaign, targeting regions such as Windsor, London, Hamilton, Niagara and the North.

"Controversial statements from Ontario Liberal, NDP candidates that led to resignations and condemnation",2025,"A series of controversial social media posts from Liberal and New Democratic Party candidates in Ontario in recent weeks has prompted two withdrawals and calls for others to resign ahead of election day on Thursday. Here's what we know about the inappropriate, misogynistic and embarrassing statements - and how parties responded to them. Brian Hamilton On Feb. 14, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party (PC) shared several screenshots on X of Thunder Bay-Superior North Liberal Party candidate Brian Hamilton making comments appearing to support American actor Bill Cosby, who has been accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women, and former CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi, who was acquitted of sexual assault charges in 2016. ""As a tribute to International Women's Day I'm going to be wrong all day,"" the Liberal candidate wrote in 2015. ""I miss #JianGhomeshi. Even if he is an ass slapping lady choker. His peculiarities don't neutralize his genius,"" he wrote on another occasion. Does Bonnie Crombie stand by her candidate who once trivialized behaviour linked to intimate partner violence? - Ontario PC Press (@PCPressOffice) February 14, 2025 Hamilton subsequently apologized for his comments in a statement, noting they ""do not reflect my current views"" as the Liberals rallied behind him, saying there was no plan to remove him from the ballot. ""I think this was a long time ago and that he's a representative, an elected official today, and he's apologized,"" Ontario Liberal Party Leader Bonnie Crombie said during a press conference following the revelations. Thomas Simpson Similar comments were uncovered by the PCs the following day, Feb. 15. ""Consent is not sexy #success,"" Ottawa Centre Liberal candidate Thomas Simpson earlier wrote on social media. Crombie weighed in during a campaign stop outside the nation's capital, saying Simpson should ""absolutely"" apologize. ""He was a young man, and he understands that is not appropriate and not tolerated, and he has completely apologized and withdrawn his statements, and he's made those apologies,"" she told reporters. Morris Beckford The PCs found more embarrassing posts the following week. On Feb. 17, an old message surfaced from Scarborough-Rouge Park Liberal candidate Morris Beckford asking followers, ""Question: Was Hitler a leader? (It's a Burns question)."" Viresh Bansal Later that same day, the PC's published a screenshot of offensive comments made by the Liberal's Oshawa candidate, Viresh Bansal, responding to federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's pledge to ""leave no stone unturned"" following the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh activist believed to have been assassinated by Indian agents in British Columbia. ""@theJagmeetSingh you can thank India for cleaning trash people,"" Bansal commented on Singh's social media account. ""Ask your gay friend @JustinTrudeau to do the same."" Bansal's comments drew the condemnation of fellow Liberal candidate Vicky Dhillon, running in Brampton East, who called the former's statement ""reprehensible, unacceptable, and will never represent my views or opinions."" ""I will not tolerate his behaviour or support him. Therefore, I am asking the Leader of the Ontario Liberal Party to immediately and officially drop Viresh Bansal as the party's candidate in Oshawa,"" Dhillon wrote in a statement. Please read my statement. - Vicky Dhillon (@VickyDhillon10) February 21, 2025 Crombie denounced Bansal's comments, saying: ""I don't stand for them. They don't reflect who I am... I don't think they reflect the values of the Ontario Liberal Party."" Last Friday, the party confirmed Bansal's campaign had been suspended. Rick Ellsmere The day after Bansal's posts were publicized, Feb. 18, the Liberal candidate in Timiskaming-Cochrane, Rick Ellsmere, was outed by the Progressive Conservatives for social media posts that included an image of a cheering Homer Simpson beside a list of ""10 Things Men Know About Women."" All the rows are blank except for the last. ""Women have Breasts,"" the graphic reads. Bonnie Crombie's repeated failure to vet her candidates and take responsibility for their behaviour shows yet again she is not ready to lead Ontario. - Ontario PC Press (@PCPressOffice) February 18, 2025 ""I apologize,"" the northern Ontario politicians told a local newspaper in Timmins when reached for comment following the revelation. ""I am running for the Ontario Liberal Party because I want to support my community. I hope to earn my community's trust so I can advocate for my riding."" Liberal party's response Bahoz Dara, the Ontario Liberal Party's press secretary, said that the string of indiscretions was more a reflection of Premier Doug Ford's desperation ""digging up social media posts from up to a decade ago."" ""No wonder,"" Dara added in a written statement to National Post. ""This is the guy who during the campaign said he supported Donald Trump, and pushed the death penalty behind closed doors, only to flip flop later... like he always does. Unlike Doug Ford, who has refused to present any plan to fix health care or make your life more affordable, Team Bonnie is focused on getting the basics right here in Ontario."" Meanwhile, Ford and the Progressive Conservatives have basked in the Liberals' embarrassment, creating and promoting a website on Monday called ""Meet Team Bonnie,"" which highlights the controversial statements made by these candidates and others who previously questioned Crombie's party leadership. The PC Party did not respond to the Post's request for comment in time for publication. Devon Monkhouse ""Bonnie makes me want to vote for another party,"" Devon Monkhouse, the Liberal candidate for Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry, wrote in July 2023, shortly before Crombie's successful leadership bid. Monkhouse polled his social media followers the previous month, asking them whether supporting Crombie was ""cringe?"" Nearly nine-in-ten (88.1 per cent) of respondents to Monkhouse's poll agreed. We agree Devon. - Ontario PC Press (@PCPressOffice) February 22, 2025 Amanda Zavitz The NDP also found themselves in the crosshairs when, on Feb. 19. The PCs shared a clip of Elgin-Middlesex-London candidate Amanda Zavitz expressing her ""secret"" desire to be a black woman. ""My secret is that I want to be a Black woman,"" Zavitz, an associate sociology professor at Western University, told a New York audience last year while speaking at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. ""I want to be an expert in inequality, with lived experiences of poverty and living in addiction and alcoholism,"" she added. Amanda Zavitz, the NDP candidate in Elgin-Middlesex-London, claims that she wants to be a Black woman so that she can gain the lived experiences of poverty, addiction, and alcoholism. Watch for yourself ?? - Ontario PC Press (@PCPressOffice) February 19, 2025 Last Thursday, Zavitz resigned from the race. In a Facebook statement, she denounced the PC Party for seeking to distract voters ""from the critical task of defeating Doug Ford and electing an Ontario NDP government.""

King Charles issues personal invite for Trump to visit Britain for state visit:   NDP MP Charlie Angus accuses monarch of not standing up for Canada,2025,"King Charles III sent a handwritten invitation to Donald Trump Thursday to come to Britain for a state visit even as the U.S. President has called repeatedly for the annexation of Canada. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivered the invitation from King Charles, who is also the monarch of Canada, during an Oval Office meeting at the White House. Mr. Trump described King Charles as a ""beautiful man, a wonderful man"" and said he and his wife Melania would be delighted to visit Britain as a guest of the monarch. ""We look forward to being there and honouring the king, honouring the country,"" he said. NDP MP Charlie Angus criticized the King for writing a personal invitation to the President who has been questioning Canadian sovereignty. ""We have our figurehead King inviting Donald Trump to the U.K. so the U.K. could cut a better deal while leaving Canada on its own,"" Mr. Angus said Thursday. ""Why do we have this guy on any of our money if he thinks our nation isn’t worth standing up for?"" Mr. Angus said Canadians shed blood in the First World War and Second World War for Britain and it’s unseemly for King Charles to get involved in politics when he is supposed to be monarch for Canada and other Commonwealth countries. ""Canadians were the ones who kept England from disappearing under the Nazis. We put a lot of our blood defending the British Crown,"" he said. ""I find it absolutely appalling that now he is stepping into politics in a very forward way if he is supposed to sit on the sidelines, while Trump is threatening our sovereignty as a nation."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office did not have an immediate response to King Charles’ invitation. Robert Finch, chair of the Monarchist League of Canada, said the British Prime Minister would have made the request for the King to issue the invitation. ""Remember, Britain, the same as as ourselves in Canada, is a constitutional monarchy and not ruled by an absolute King,"" he said in an e-mail. The British Prime Minister told Mr. Trump that this would be his second state visit to his country, which he described as ""really special"" and ""unprecedented."" No date has been set for the visit. At a later joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Starmer was asked by a reporter if he raised Mr. Trump’s desire to annex Canada and whether King Charles has expressed any concern about the President’s talk of taking over the country. ""You mention Canada, I think you are trying to find a divide between us which doesn’t exist,"" Mr. Starmer said as the President interjected, saying ""that’s enough."" Mr. Trump had high praise for Mr. Starmer – unlike the potshots he’s taken at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau whom he has derided as governor of the 51st state. He’s also said ""Justin’s a loser, always has been,"" saying he ""destroyed"" Canada. Mr. Trump remarked that the British Prime Minister is ""a special man – and the United Kingdom is a wonderful country that I know very well, I’m there a lot."" He also talked about the golf courses he owns in the country. Mr. Trump also said Britain, France and Australia were great allies but made no mention of Canada. During his first term, Mr. Trump met with Queen Elizabeth II in July, 2018 and again during an official state visit in June, 2019. The president also went to Buckingham Palace for a NATO summit in late 2019. King Charles became king in 2022 following his mother’s death.

NDP seeks G7 ban on Trump,2025,"Canada's New Democratic and Green parties, in separate statements Wednesday, declared the U.S. is no longer an ally under a president who is a ""fascist"" and should be banned from entering Canada for the G7 leaders' meeting in June. ""What do you call a guy who threatens his allies including with the use of military force, spreads disinformation, proclaims he is above the law, and fires anyone who won't do what he says - even those in law enforcement and the military?""

"Ontario’s election is today. Here’s what you need to know about party platforms and how to vote:   Doug Ford’s PCs are seeking a new majority as the NDP, Liberals and Greens hope to gain ground. Learn more about what’s at stake",2025,"Ontarians hadn’t expected another new provincial election until 2026 – but, like much of the world, they learned the second Donald Trump era is a time of surprises. The U.S. President’s tariff threats have put Canadians on a path to a trade war. Ontario, the most trade-dependent province, stands to lose a lot. While there had been talk of a snap election before that turn of events, that was Doug Ford’s stated reason for dissolving the legislature, sending the province to the polls on Feb. 27, 2025. The Progressive Conservative Leader, who already has a majority, says he hopes to get a strong mandate to confront Washington. The NDP and Liberals, which chose new leaders after the 2022 election, say they won’t let him win without a fight, and are pressing him on more traditional campaign issues such as health care. Here’s a primer on where the parties stand, who leads them and what you’ll need to cast a ballot today. Ontario’s party leaders Doug Ford As the son of an MPP and brother of Toronto’s late mayor, Mr. Ford was no stranger to politics when he took over the Progressive Conservatives, then struggling with a leadership crisis, in 2018. He’s won two straight majorities and kept his polling numbers high, despite controversies over a Greenbelt land-development scheme (which the RCMP is still investigating), relocating the Ontario Science Centre, the costs of speeding up alcohol sales in corner stores and other policies. As current head of the Council of the Federation, he’s recently been a point man for the premiers on fighting back against the Trump administration, which is why he’s spent part of this election cycle in Washington. That’s led to accusations that he used those trips to campaign, inappropriately blurring the lines between premier and party leader. Marit Stiles Ms. Stiles, a Newfoundlander, got into politics during her studies at Carleton University in Ottawa, then worked as an NDP MP’s assistant and later a school trustee. When the Ontario NDP surged to Official Opposition status in 2018, she became education critic, then took the leadership in an uncontested race in 2023 months after Andrea Horwath stepped down on election night. Ms. Stiles has been warning supporters about an early election call since this past summer, but when it finally came, the tariff issue forced her and the party to pivot quickly in its messaging. Trade issues are top-of-mind in some of the ""orange/blue"" ridings where she is targeting the PCs, such as the Niagara Region and Southwestern Ontario. Bonnie Crombie The former mayor of Mississauga took the reins of a much-diminished Ontario Liberal Party in 2023. It was reduced to third-party status in the 2018 rout of the Kathleen Wynne government and failed to rebuild support in the following election. Ms. Crombie – who has said the party drifted too far to the left under previous leaders, and has distanced herself from Trudeau policies such as carbon pricing – has tried to shift her party to the centre while accusing Mr. Ford of poor stewardship of provincial finances and services. Targeted Liberal ads seek to sway NDP and Tory voters alike to her cause in strategic ridings. She’s also endorsed Mark Carney for the federal Liberal leadership race, which is set to be decided on March 9. ""Wishing you the best on Thursday, and let’s keep building!"" Mr. Carney replied in a Feb. 25 post on X. Mike Schreiner Mr. Schreiner has been in charge of his party longer than any of the other leaders. The Greens chose the Kansas-born entrepreneur in 2009 after his years of community organizing in Guelph, where he broke through in 2018 as the first Green MPP in Ontario history. A second MPP, Kitchener’s Aislinn Clancy, joined him at Queen’s Park in a 2023 by-election, and now both are racing to keep their seats and add more if possible. Party platforms: Four charts to understand the key issues The economy is front and centre in the platforms that the Tories, New Democrats, Liberals and Greens have released so far, but not everything comes down to tariffs. Here’s an overview of four key issues. Tariffs and trade Ontario sells and buys more goods internationally than any other province, and the United States accounts for more than 85 per cent of its exports. U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, set to take effect March 12, will make it more costly for Americans to buy Ontario’s metals – but before that, wider trade restrictions could be even more painful for other industries.

David Staples: Is the rot real? NDP alleges 'worst government corruption in Alberta's history',2025,"Premier Danielle Smith has so far faced up to the first gargantuan scandal of her time in office with her usual blend of assertiveness and openness, admirable traits that have served her well during lesser controversies. But they won't be enough this time around. She can't clear herself with fine speeches. If she and her government are going to be vindicated, that can only happen by way of a thorough and independent investigation. On Tuesday in the legislature, the NDP framed the health-care procurement scandal as ""the worst government corruption in Alberta's history."" NDP MLA David Shepherd summed up the allegations in colourful and succinct fashion. ""The premier's pursuit of absolute power over every aspect of our health care system has brought us into the CorruptCare scandal, damning allegations of political interference, rising as high as the premier's office involving over half a billion dollars being funnelled to favoured private companies paying them inflated rates for surgeries, and that when the CEO and board of AHS investigated these sweetheart deals and moved to involve the auditor general and the RCMP, the health minister had them fired."" Alberta NDP MLA David Shepherd succinctly sums up the allegations against Danielle Smith's government. The procurement scandal hit the Legislature today. What is your take on it? - David Staples (@DavidStaplesYEG) February 25, 2025 Unlike past tempests, this criticism comes this time from credible government insiders, first fired Alberta Health Services CEO Athana Mentzelopoulos in her sensational statement of claim against the government, now Smith's own Infrastructure Minister Peter Guthrie, his level of concern about flaws in government procurement practices so great that he resigned from Smith's cabinet on Tuesday. Even under heavy NDP fire in the legislature, Smith was as cool and calm as ever, again stating she had nothing to do with the procurement decisions in question, nor was she aware of any wrongdoing. She again pledged her government would fully co-operate with the auditor general's investigation. In a statement, Smith also offered up her clearest statement yet on her government's next step. ""I have also directed our senior civil service to retain a highly credible third party with a strong legal background capable of investigating this matter independently of government so we can understand exactly what occurred."" At the same time, the premier launched a fierce counterattack to try and take the high ground, putting the current allegations in the context of Alberta Health Service officials being reluctant to make necessary changes in order to drop surgical wait times, such as contracting out more publicly-funded procedures to private clinics. ""What we find unusual is having given $3.5 billion additional dollars to Alberta Health Services over the last few years, they are doing no additional surgeries, no more today than they were back in 2019,' Smith said. ""We have to look into whether or not AHS was trying to frustrate government policy by standing in the way of clear direction to contract out to chartered surgical facilities, or if there was something wrong with the procurement."" Smith also said she's found it difficult to know what AHS is up to when it comes to finances and contracting. ""It's a complete black box. The more dollars we give them, the fact of the matter is they're not performing. That's the reason why we have used charter surgical facilities to reduce the surgical backlog. We have 40,000 surgeries that were done a few years ago (at chartered surgical facilities), we're now up to 62,500, and we're going to keep on using charter surgical facilities because it is the only thing that is reducing the backlogs."" Danielle Smith's strategy against corruption allegations? To suggest Alberta Health Services is inefficient and uncooperative, protecting its own turf by refusing to hand over information about surgical contracts, let alone reward contracts to other operators. - David Staples (@DavidStaplesYEG) February 25, 2025 Smith's latest attack on AHS follows her weekend shot where she claimed for months AHS never brought any substantive evidence or documentation related to the procurement matter to Health Minister Adriana LaGrange or to the government. Smith may well be right that AHS leadership was prickly and closed, and that it was loathe to move surgeries away from AHS facilities to private operators. But that's not the question of the day. What we need to know is whether or not there is rot in the government procurement process. Is this a matter of one or two procurement operators within the government getting paid off to hand out sweet contracts? Is there some fatal flaw in the procurement process that needs addressing? If there was corruption, does it rise to the level of political managers and decision-makers? Or is this more of a wrongful dismissal dispute gone nuclear? Until we have answers, until the premier knows herself where things went wrong, how can she have the confidence and public trust to tackle major issues, namely her government's mission to bring more private delivery of publicly-funded health care services? Solid, credible information from independent investigators can't come quickly enough. dstaples@postmedia.com Related Alberta infrastructure minister resigns from cabinet citing concerns over government procurement practices Alberta cabinet minister denies allegations made by ousted AHS president Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don't miss the news you need to know - add EdmontonJournal.com and EdmontonSun.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters You can also support our journalism by becoming a digital subscriber.

NDP hammers contracts scandal as legislature resumes sitting,2025,"Alberta MLAs returned to the legislature Tuesday where the centre of attention remained the unfolding scandal around health-care procurement, with the resignation of a cabinet minister earlier in the day furthering that focus. The spring session of the legislature got underway in the afternoon, with the government tabling its first of an expected 20 pieces of legislation to come before the legislature adjourns again in mid-May. The day began with news that Peter Guthrie is stepping away from his role as infrastructure minister, citing concerns over the government's procurement processes. Guthrie was not in the assembly. The party says he remains within its government caucus. Question period was dominated by the corruption allegations that have dogged the government since former AHS chief executive Athana Mentzelopoulos filed a $1.7-million wrongful dismissal lawsuit. In her statement of claim, she alleges she was sacked after she investigated procurement practices around contracts for chartered surgical facilities and the importation of children's pain medication from Turkey via Edmonton-based MHCare, led by businessman Sam Mraiche. Those allegations have not been tested in court. The auditor general is investigating and the government is seeking a third party to assist with its own internal query. The Opposition New Democrats focused their questions Tuesday on the allegations, with Opposition house leader Christina Gray demanding to know whether Premier Danielle Smith directed Health Minister Adriana LaGrange to fire Mentzelopoulos, and if not, when she learned of the firing. Smith replied by saying procurement functions fall ""deep within the administration"" and there was no political involvement. ""If something has gone wrong within AHS within their own procurement processes, we absolutely want to get to the bottom of it."" Gray challenged Smith on her assertion that she only learned of the scandal from media reports that first emerged Feb. 5, noting the auditor general had given notice of a probe on Jan. 31 and that Smith herself chairs the executive council, which signed off on the firing of the AHS board at the end of January. Smith didn't directly address the timing discrepancy and instead pointed to issues within AHS. ""We have to look into whether or not AHS was trying to frustrate government policy by standing in the way of clear direction to contract out to chartered surgical facilities or if there was something wrong with the procurement, and that's what we're going to do."" NDP deputy leader Rakhi Pancholi questioned why LaGrange remained in her role and how she could claim to have Albertans' trust given Guthrie's resignation. ""These allegations ... are about direct interference and pressure by the premier's office and the minister of health herself into AHS to secure the money for their friends,"" Pancholi said. LaGrange said the allegations in the lawsuit against her are false and reiterated her plans to fight those claims through the legal process. ""We need to get to the bottom of this, and we need to be transparent, and we have every intention of doing so."" Pancholi agreed on the need to get answers, but said that is impossible as long as LaGrange remains in the role. ""Not only are the UCP's handprints all over AHS, but now Albertans hear that their thumb is on the scale, too, but only for their friends and not for Albertans."" mblack@postmedia.com","Edmonton Journal; Edmonton, Alta.","Edmonton, Alta.","Black, Matw",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 26, 2025",Legislatures; Scandals,,2025-02-26,Edmonton Journal
NDP leader pledges to invest in Windsor school repairs and transit; Ontario election 2025 Stiles attacks Ford on Trump tariff battle in only non-Tory riding west of London,2025,"An NDP government would tackle the local region's $405-million school repair backlog, cover half of Transit Windsor's operating budget, and upload responsibility of E.C. Row Expressway upkeep from the city to the province, NDP Leader Marit Stiles pledged on a Windsor campaign stop on Monday. With an election just days away, the head of Ontario's main opposition party made a final campaign push in Windsor, touting her party's position on health care, affordability, rent control, and jobs. ""These are ridings that we want to hold,"" Stiles told reporters in Windsor West, the only riding this side of London that is not Tory blue. ""You can see it from the folks that are out today. There's a lot of excitement here, a lot of momentum. We're feeling people here want change, and they know firsthand what the cost of Doug Ford and the conservatives would be."" A crowd of about 60 supporters gathered at Lanspeary Park waved orange signs and cheered as Stiles stepped off her campaign bus. Stiles was joined by local NDP candidates, including MPP Lisa Gretzky for Windsor West, Gemma Grey-Hall for Windsor-Tecumseh, and Rachael Mills for Essex. Also in attendance was MP Brian Masse, the federal NDP representative for Windsor West. One of Stiles's key promises during her brief Windsor visit was to strengthen Ontario's healthcare system and increase the number of family doctors - particularly in Windsor-Essex, where nearly 47,000 residents are without one. Addressing the rising cost of living is also at the top of the NDP agenda. ""You know what people want? They want us to address the rising cost of food, the rent increases that are forcing people to lose their homes,"" said Stiles. ""They're wondering when they're going to get a family doctor and how long they're going to have to wait in emergency rooms if they're even open. They're wondering where they're going to find affordable homes to live in. ""They're seeing jobs flee the province. So, to me, this is just another example of Doug Ford not being in touch with where Ontarians are at."" Stiles outlined the NDP plan to introduce a monthly grocery rebate, rent control protections, and increased provincial funding for public transportation, which would include covering 50 per cent of operating costs for Transit Windsor. She pledged to upload the E.C. Row Expressway back to provincial management and address the region's $405-million repair backlog across all four school boards in the area. Stiles also took aim at Conservative Leader Doug Ford, who said he called the election a year early to secure a stronger mandate from Ontarians to navigate the next four years of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, including new tariffs. After a month-long pause, Trump on Monday said he will still move forward with a 25 per cent tariff on most imports from Canada starting next week. ""Hell of a lot of good Doug Ford did for us, right?"" said Stiles. ""He called this election, said he was going down to Washington twice to push back, and here we are with tariffs, right?""

The NDP and Liberals, which chose new leaders after the 2022 election, say they won’t let him win without a fight, and are pressing him on more traditional campaign issues such as health care. Here’s a primer on where the parties stand, who leads them and what you’ll need to cast a ballot on Thursday. Ontario’s party leaders Doug Ford As the son of an MPP and brother of Toronto’s late mayor, Mr. Ford was no stranger to politics when he took over the Progressive Conservatives, then struggling with a leadership crisis, in 2018. He’s won two straight majorities and kept his polling numbers high, despite controversies over a Greenbelt land-development scheme (which the RCMP is still investigating), relocating the Ontario Science Centre, the costs of speeding up alcohol sales in corner stores and other policies. As current head of the Council of the Federation, he’s recently been a point man for the premiers on fighting back against the Trump administration, which is why he’s spent part of this election cycle in Washington. That’s led to accusations that he used those trips to campaign, inappropriately blurring the lines between premier and party leader. Marit Stiles Ms. Stiles, a Newfoundlander, got into politics during her studies at Carleton University in Ottawa, then worked as an NDP MP’s assistant and later a school trustee. When the Ontario NDP surged to Official Opposition status in 2018, she became education critic, then took the leadership in an uncontested race in 2023 months after Andrea Horwath stepped down on election night. Ms. Stiles has been warning supporters about an early election call since this past summer, but when it finally came, the tariff issue forced her and the party to pivot quickly in its messaging. Trade issues are top-of-mind in some of the ""orange/blue"" ridings where she is targeting the PCs, such as the Niagara Region and Southwestern Ontario. Bonnie Crombie The former mayor of Mississauga took the reins of a much-diminished Ontario Liberal Party in 2023. It was reduced to third-party status in the 2018 rout of the Kathleen Wynne government and failed to rebuild support in the following election. Ms. Crombie – who has said the party drifted too far to the left under previous leaders, and has distanced herself from Trudeau policies such as carbon pricing – has tried to shift her party to the centre while accusing Mr. Ford of poor stewardship of provincial finances and services. Targeted Liberal ads seek to sway NDP and Tory voters alike to her cause in strategic ridings. She’s also endorsed Mark Carney for the federal Liberal leadership race, which is set to be decided on March 9. ""Wishing you the best on Thursday, and let’s keep building!"" Mr. Carney replied in a Feb. 25 post on X. Mike Schreiner Mr. Schreiner has been in charge of his party longer than any of the other leaders. The Greens chose the Kansas-born entrepreneur in 2009 after his years of community organizing in Guelph, where he broke through in 2018 as the first Green MPP in Ontario history. A second MPP, Kitchener’s Aislinn Clancy, joined him at Queen’s Park in a 2023 by-election, and now both are racing to keep their seats and add more if possible. Party platforms: Four charts to understand the key issues The economy is front and centre in the platforms that the Tories, New Democrats, Liberals and Greens have released so far, but not everything comes down to tariffs. Here’s an overview of four key issues. Tariffs and trade Ontario sells and buys more goods internationally than any other province, and the United States accounts for more than 85 per cent of its exports. U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, set to take effect March 12, will make it more costly for Americans to buy Ontario’s metals – but before that, wider trade restrictions could be even more painful for other industries. Every Ontario party proposes to limit the damage with some form of buy-local strategy and lifting limits on interprovincial trade.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Annett, Evan",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 26, 2025",Emergency medical care; Infrastructure; Government purchasing; Political leadership; Homeless people; Housing starts; Pandemics; Rent control; Tariffs; Taxes; Provincial elections; Political campaigns; Tax cuts; Voters; Trade restrictions; Interprovincial trade; Tax increases,,2025-02-26,The Globe and Mail
Mulcair: All but the Quebecer in the room dodged Bill 96 question,2025,"Monday night's French Liberal leaders debate produced little news beyond the obvious lack of fluent French by both Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland. Most francophone commentators managed to stay concentrated on the messages the candidates tried to put forward during the two-hour verbal joust. That being said, there was still lots of analysis of the poor quality of French. My French LCN/TVA colleague and highly respected journalist Emmanuelle Latraverse scored it (slightly) in favour of Carney, based mostly on the high-level, detailed proposals he made on a series of subjects, including the economy. She, too, seemed gobsmacked about the generally weak command of French on the stage. Of the four candidates present, only Montrealer Frank Baylis could be said to be fluently bilingual. Karina Gould a close second. Both are long shots in the campaign despite their qualities. On the issues dear to many Quebec voters, Carney got in clear lines on the decline of French and the need to promote and protect it. Those words have generally been greeted approvingly by journalists and commentators here. When the subject turned to the positions of the candidates on Bill 96 and Bill 21, voters were served a wilted and heavily accented word salad by Carney, Freeland and Gould. Only Frank Baylis had the courage, for example, to underscore his firm opposition to Bill 21, Legault's law that openly discriminates against religious minorities. Gould hinted at some form of disapproval by talking about the importance of defending the Charter of Rights, but seemed unwilling to clarify, specifically, beyond that. The question from the moderator concerning Quebec's language law, Bill 96, tried to zero in on the notion of a Quebec constitution. It didn't work and we were all left wondering whether any of them had a position on that law. Bill 96 removes equality rights for English, particularly before the courts, for example. Both issues could return during the English debate, but Liberal organizers appear to have gone out of their way to avoid putting forward questions that could prove too divisive and only help their opponents. One verbal slip by Carney may have gone unnoticed were it not for a very quick, and effective effort by Freeland to draw a circle around the stain. Carney had said ""We agree with Hamas,"" clearly trying to say ""We agree with regard to Hamas."" Sensing an opportunity, Freeland immediately cut him off saying ""we're against Hamas."" Carney, of course, corrected himself but the damage was done and the Conservatives were on it right away. Quebecers are used to a heavily accented clip from a Carney or a Freeland, in which they deliver a well-prepared line that will make the evening news. Putting their laboured French on stage for two hours is a completely different proposition and may have come as a stark surprise for many francophone voters. A new Léger poll released just prior to Monday's French debate had the federal Liberals two points up on the Conservatives, Canada-wide. In Quebec, the Liberals, under Carney, are given an astounding lead that would give them a massive majority of seats. Time will tell whether last night's debate will have an effect on that. When we look back at the French debate, it may turn out to be an inflection point. Who won? Carney or Freeland? The answer may turn out to be: The Bloc Québécois.",The Montreal Gazette (Online); Montreal,Montreal,"Mulcair, Tom",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 25, 2025",Voters,Nom: Hamas; NAICS: 813940,2025-02-25,Montreal Gazette
FIRST READING: Jagmeet Singh eligible for pension today!,2025,"First Reading is a daily newsletter keeping you posted on the travails of Canadian politicos, all curated by the National Post's own Tristin Hopper. To get an early version sent directly to your inbox, sign up here TOP STORY NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's parliamentary pension - cited by some critics as the main reason he has continued to prop up the Trudeau government - officially becomes vested on Tuesday. Singh was first elected to the House of Commons in a by-election on Feb. 25, 2019. As such, Tuesday marks his sixth year as a member of Parliament, thus making him eligible for the body's so-called ""gold-plated"" pension. As early as Singh's 55th birthday, on Jan., 2034, he will be eligible to begin collecting a retirement allowance of about $60,000 per year Assuming that Singh lives to 90 years old, this works out to a lifetime pension payout of about $2.3 million. Crime tourists: Organized burglary gangs are wintering in Canada and ransacking homes First Liberal leadership 'debate' offers little to distinguish between the candidates Retirement allowances under the parliamentary pension plan are calculated based on an MP's highest salary while in Parliament, and also on their accumulated years of service. Assuming Singh doesn't win his seat in the next general election, his $60,000 is nowhere near the top payout offered under the program. If Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre were to resign tomorrow, for instance, his salary as Leader of the Opposition and his 21 years in the House of Commons would put him in line for about $200,000 per year starting at age 55. Starting last summer, the Conservative Party began officially accusing Singh of propping up the Trudeau government in a cynical bid to secure his parliamentary pension. A web ad debuted in July referred to the NDP leader as ""Sellout Singh,"" and carried the tagline, ""He gets his pension, you pay the price."" Singh gets his pension. Trudeau gets power. You get the bill. Sellout Singh is betraying Canadians by propping up Trudeau just long enough to qualify for his pension. Trudeau stays in power.Singh gets his pension.YOU pay the price. Posted by Conservative Party of Canada - Parti conservateur du Canada on Thursday, July 25, 2024 Conservative MPs also started making the charge a regular component of their public statements. ""Time after time, Sellout Jagmeet Singh has demonstrated that he puts protecting his gold-plated pension ahead of Canadian workers,"" reads a typical example, a December press release put out by Deputy Leader Melissa Lantsman The accusation was also picked up by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said in September that Singh would never help trigger an early election before his pension vested. ""There's nothing more important to these greedy politicians than collecting a pension.... I'll stand up here and apologize to all the greedy politicians if he calls the election early,"" he said I can arrange private funding to cover his pension - if he allows NOW for an election in the early months of 2025 - for the sake of the future of Canada - * W. Brett Wilson * (@WBrettWilson) December 1, 2024 Singh has long denied the charge, saying in September that ""it's another tired old lie that (Conservative Leader) Pierre Poilievre likes to say."" One point against the accusation is that Singh didn't have all that much trouble earning money prior to entering politics. Singh worked as a criminal defence attorney, and his notable penchant for luxury items seems to indicate that his income was well in excess of $60,000 per year. There are also any number of other reasons why his party would repeatedly vote to prop up the Trudeau government. For one, the Trudeau government has proved to be among the most left-leaning federal governments in Canadian history, more in line with NDP policy than almost any prior Liberal government. The NDP also doesn't have enough money to contest an election; the party's most recent financial statements showed them with just $300,000 in cash Any talk of Singh staving off an election purely to protect his pension eligibility would be moot if the NDP leader was likely to win re-election in his Vancouver-area riding. But the riding is not an NDP safe seat by any means, and since September poll projections have occasionally shown Singh as likely to lose to a Conservative challenger. IN OTHER NEWS After Liberal leadership candidate Ruby Dhalla was disqualified on Friday for alleged financial irregularities, Dhalla accused the Liberal Party of ""false and fabricated"" accusations designed to prevent her from criticizing Mark Carney in open debate. Liberal-aligned strategists appearing on CBC panels have not tremendously helped debunk Dhalla's case that she was pushed out for political expediency. ""I certainly hope the party finds a legitimate reason to disqualify her candidacy before the debates,"" Stevie O'Brien, a veteran Liberal staffer and legal counsel, told Power & Politics shortly before Dhalla's disqualification U.S. President Donald Trump has once again returned to saying that he'll levy 25 per cent tariffs on Canada starting in March. The above comes from the Facebook page of U.S. conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. Although many of Trump's policies have proved extremely popular with the U.S. electorate - particularly in the realm of border security - that's decidedly not the case with his threats against Canada. According to polls on the subject, most Americans, much like Shapiro, don't have a clear grasp of why the tariff threats against Canada are happening. It's extremely rare that Alberta and Quebec have anything in common politically, so it's notable that both provinces have come out in support of tougher sentencing for criminal offenders. ""In Québec, we believe that the sentences handed down must reflect the seriousness of the offences. The victims of these heinous crimes must live with the consequences for the rest of their lives,"" wrote Quebec's Justice Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette in a recent op-ed for the National Post. This accords with a recent call by the Government of Alberta for Ottawa to reintroduce mandatory minimum sentencing for drug traffickers Get all of these insights and more into your inbox by signing up for the First Reading newsletter here",National Post (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Hopper, Tristin",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 25, 2025",Members of Parliament; Political leadership; Decades; Elections; Political parties,Nom: National Post; NAICS: 513110,2025-02-25,National Post
"NDP defends withholding details of shÃ•shálh Nation deal; Province kept amount, terms of payments secret until well after last year's election",2025,"The New Democrats last August committed the province to paying more than $100 million over five years to the Sunshine Coast-based shíshálh Nation. But they kept the amount and related terms secret until well after the provincial election. The payments were set out in a 44-page foundation agreement on Indigenous reconciliation, signed Aug. 16, 2024, but not released until Jan. 29 of this year. The schedule sets out $104 million in payments, commencing ""as soon as practicable"" after the agreement was signed in August 2024 and continuing through to 2028. The breakdown includes $47.6 million for economic development, $16.6 million for culture and language, $8.8 million for implementation, $2.8 million for environmental restoration, $1.8 million for water infrastructure, and $1.4 million for monitoring, enforcement, negotiations, and environmental studies. The agreement also commits the province to ""seeking $25 million in provincial funding to address housing needs"" or failing that, from ""climate change resiliency program funds."" Those payments are in addition to $32 million provided to the nation for land purchases and implementation costs in an agreement signed by the previous John Horgan government in 2018. That agreement was touted as ""the first major reconciliation agreement between the NDP government and a First Nation."" The latest agreement, an amendment to the earlier one, also provides for the transfer of five square kilometres of provincial government land to the nation for economic development and cultural use. Other terms remain confidential. Several dozen passages in the main agreement and two whole appendices are blanked out in the version released on Jan. 29. The censored parts deal with undisclosed lands that have been deemed ""invaluable to the shíshálh Nation"" and warranting protection for ""future generations."" To that end, the province has provided direct funding to the nation to allow it to ""acquire lands on a willing seller, willing buyer basis and to cover due diligence and transactional costs and expenses, including fees and taxes."" The province says the details were ""withheld from the public to safeguard any potential disturbance or desecration and because some are in active negotiations with commercial confidence aspects."" The New Democrats initially excused the delay in making the other terms public, saying they wanted to release the agreement - honest, they did. But they couldn't work out a schedule to do so before the government went into caretaker mode at the Sept. 21 start of the election campaign. Still, on Aug. 1 of last year, the New Democrats somehow managed to release a related plan regarding management of dock space and boathouses within the traditional territory of the shíshálh Nation. The terms were crafted to defuse a festering controversy over dock management on the eve of the election. The stated goal was to provide predictability for ""Sunshine Coast dock and boathouse owners."" It appears to have succeeded, as the New Democrats cruised to an easy win in the riding of Powell River-Sunshine Coast. Ironically, in the deal released last month, the New Democrats say ""we recognize that the success of the dock management plan will be improved by transparency and public understanding."" On the weekend, I got a note from the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation about my Saturday column on the delayed release of the agreement with the shíshálh Nation. The ministry challenged my view that the agreement signed last year and released this year broke new ground with commitments to negotiate Aboriginal title and also to negotiate ""exclusive decision-making"" with the shíshálh Nation. The ministry maintained that ""the commitment to negotiate Aboriginal title is included in both a 2016 government-to-government agreement and 2018 foundation agreement."" It says that exclusive decision making was also contemplated in 2018. The earlier commitments are vague and non-specific on how to proceed on Aboriginal title within the traditional territory of the shíshálh Nation, an estimated 5,000 square kilometres on the Sunshine Coast. The new agreement is more precise: ""We agree to negotiate and attempt to reach an agreement recognizing shíshálh Nation's Aboriginal title."" The New Democrats are also willing to act unilaterally on Aboriginal title: ""The province's commitment is not conditional on Canada's participation or on Canada becoming a party to the agreement."" The 2018 agreement put overwhelming emphasis on shared as opposed to exclusive decision-making. The new agreement commits to negoti- ating under the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, which did not even exist as law in 2018. In a followup note Monday regarding the decision to delay, the ministry said ""Jan. 29 was determined as the best date for the announcement to provide enough time for valuable conversations with local governments and other interest holders."" Now that the agreement is public, ""the community is very interested in how the agreement will be implemented. We will ensure that members of the community are aware about future engagement opportunities."" When they get around to it, presumably. In short, the delay had nothing to do with keeping a lid on the terms until after the election. It was about providing enough time to, you know, start a proper conversation with anyone gullible enough to trust this government on such matters. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 25, 2025",Provincial elections; Native peoples; Economic development; Negotiations; Decision making; Reconciliation,,2025-02-25,The Vancouver Sun
NDP And liberal leaders rally supporters in kingston ahead of ontario election,2025,"The City of Kingston was a hot spot for political visits over the weekend. NDP leader Marit Stiles and Liberal leader Bonnie Crombie both stopped in the Limestone City to meet with supporters in a final push leading up to provincial election day on Thursday. In a last-minute change of schedule, Stiles was dropped off at Springer Market Square and was met by a group of cheering supporters. With City Hall and the outdoor skating rink behind her, she spoke about health care, affordable housing, hospital wait times and the need to overcome the liberal threshold in Kingston and The Islands. ""I'm on the road for the next few days and my target are ridings that we need to flip,"" Stiles said. ""The reason we need to flip them is because riding by riding by riding across this province, we are going to elect New Democrats and form an NDP government that is on your side."" Kingston and The Islands has been a Liberal stronghold since 2018 and she said her goal is to turn Kingston and Islands from red to orange. ""If Doug Ford wants to call an election in the middle of a crisis, that's an opportunity to make a change in the province of Ontario, and boy, do we need a change,"" Stiles said. ""In Kingston, there are 20,000 people without a family doctor. Rent has increased by 40 per cent since 2018. There are 26 people sitting right now being treated in hallways at Kingston Health Sciences Centre, that's the new normal. Right now, there are 8,000 people using the food bank here and 30 per cent of them are children. That is the cost of Doug Ford,"" Stiles told supporters. To fix those issues, Stiles said the NDP is going to fight rising costs, deliver a grocery rebate program so that people have money in their pockets and provide a universal school food program. ""We have a really great plan that is going to help out lower to middle income people who are struggling with the cost of food,"" she said. ""We have a grocery rebate program which is going to mean that families get $122 in their pocket every month to help them with groceries and foods."" By her side was Kingston and The Islands candidate Elliot Goodell Ugalde, who emphasized the need for helping Kingstonians. ""The Ontario Federation of Labour said that 13.3 per cent of Kingstonians live below the poverty line. People are upset, people have said that the average wait time at (Kingston General Hospital) is 22 hours. Wolfe Islanders, now that they've removed the paramedic service from that island and they've cut the amount of ferries that go back and forth. If you have a medical emergency and you live on Wolfe Island, you first have to wait for a ferry, which again wait times have been cut in half and when you make it to KGH you have to wait 22 hours just to be in a hallway,"" said Goodell Ugalde. In the midst of when post secondary institutions such as St. Lawrence College are cutting programs, she vowed to invest in that level of education to help support jobs, the economy and communities. Affordable housing is also top of mind for many people and rent control is one aspect her party plans to take control of. ""It's gotten completely out of control and people are losing their homes and that's why we are seeing so many people out on the street living in encampments,"" Stiles said. ""We've got to bring back real rent control. The other thing we need to do build truly affordable housing. That means working with builders, working with municipalities, working with all the non-profits."" If elected, Stiles said her 100-day promise would be rent control and supportive housing. Meanwhile, at Ted Hsu's campaign office on Princess Street, Liberal leader Bonnie Crombie laid out her political platform to supporters and said Ontario needs a leader who is accountable. ""The Toronto Star talked about a woman from Kingston that she waited 40 hours to get a hospital bed,"" Crombie said. She pointed out that the woman with metastasized breast cancer waited in the hospital's emergency room, ""vulnerable to whatever might be contagious in the ER room."" ""That's the state of Doug Ford's Ontario, even here in Kingston,"" Crombie said. ""We want to redevelop the Kingston General Hospital, that's a big priority for Ted and myself. Affordability is key no matter where you are. It's all about health care, making life more affordable for people and investing in education,"" Crombie said. Crombie visited Pan Chancho Bakery with Hsu prior to the rally and said their plan is to cut taxes for small business owners and reduce income tax for Ontarians. ""The first $50,000 to $75,000, we are going to reduce that,"" Crombie said. ""Plus, we are going to take the HST off your home heating and hydro. Between those two things we are going to save you $1,150 a year, that's better than the $200 cheque that you got once,"" said Crombie. Affordable housing was also on the list of promises by the Liberals. ""We're going to take off hidden taxes called development charges. That will reduce the price of homes by $170,000,"" Crombie said. ""We'll remove the land transfer tax for anyone who is a first-time home buyer, a senior, a not-for-profit. We're going to fix the backlog in the Landlord and Tenant Board, and we're going to have phased in rent control."" Housing and health care are priorities in Kingston, Hsu said. ""Housing has been top ofmindin Kingston for almost 10 years, but then health care, we've made some progress I would say, but there is still a lot to go,"" he said. ""For example, primary care, there's a lot of retirements coming sO we have to replace those family doctors. We still have days where ambulances are lined up at emergency. It's recruitment and retention. Some of the retention is making sure that the wages are competitive. So it's wages and working conditions. ""It's about getting the basics right,"" Crombie said. ""It's very tough to attract investmentinto Ontarioi the company that's coming in, their employees can't afford the housing, their track to traffic gridlock, can't get a family doctor and can't afford groceries. So it's very tough."" Both Stiles and Crombie visited Kingston during the last weekend of advanced polls, which in Kingston drew in 11,000 voters. mkulchar@postmedia.com","Kingston Whig - Standar d; Kingston, Ont.","Kingston, Ont.","Kulchar, Maegen",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 25, 2025",Islands; Hospitals; Emergency medical care; Provincial elections; Affordable housing; Rent control,,2025-02-25,Kingston Whig - Standard
"Ontario election: Will Doug Ford's blue wave envelop Sudbury?; The PCs last held the riding almost 40 years ago but analysts are predicting a close race with the NDP. Meanwhile, housing, health care and boosting mining are top city concerns",2025,"There is a lot going on in the world right now, but as the provincial election nears, access to publicly-funded health care remains top of mind for many voters in the Sudbury riding. Raymond Hammond, president of USW Local 6500, said his union wants to see a representative at Queen's Park who listens to community concerns, ""someone that has lived in the community, worked in the community and knows the needs, as well as anyone else."" Highways, including the last 70 km of Highway 69, remain a priority for the Steelworkers. Of course, access to an efficient and vibrant health-care system is also a top concern. ""Sudbury needs safe highways that lead to the rest of the province. Sudbury needs faster access to public health care, including mental health (care), that is properly staffed and supplied. Sudbury needs an end to hallway medicine,"" Hammond said. ""Sudbury needs properly funded and supported education to ensure their children are ready for the workforce, especially the local workforce. Sudbury needs transitional housing to offer proper support for its unhoused population. Sudbury needs to be more affordable."" The United Steelworkers have long supported the New Democrats, and Hammond said voters should keep one eye on the past, while the other focuses on the horizon. ""The priorities of the Local are simple. We need a government that takes care of the people; a government that addresses health care, including mental health care; education; highway safety; housing; and affordability,"" he offered. ""These issues help everyone, and they enable the Local and any other union to concentrate bargaining power on wages, and other protections and benefits."" It is easy to make promises, but more challenging to actually bring results to fruition. Sudbury voters should consider who would make the strongest advocate. ""Voters need to think about the MPPs that have been there for them over the years and put in the time to talk to their constituents, attend community events and represent them at Queen's Park,"" Hammond commented. ""Voters need to think about the differences between federal and provincial politics, and what our MPPs can actually do for us."" Mayor Paul Lefebvre seconded Hammond's thoughts on health care. He said on his mind this election is Health Sciences North and the state of the local system. ""We're seeing our hospital overwhelmed. We don't have the capacity to deal with the influx of folks, not only from Sudbury but from the huge catchment area it serves now,"" Lefebvre said last week. ""For me, it's helping advocate and getting funding for our hospital to grow - to add more beds."" As Lefebvre noted, Greater Sudbury has a current population hovering at about 180,000; however, the hospital and its mental health care programs are serving a population of about 400,000. ""The funding we receive is not equal to the needs and the demand on our system. That's why our city, as a whole, can't keep up,"" he said. ""We are the hub of the northeast and when there are acute mental health care needs, often people are told they can access services here, causing us to be way over capacity. That is a challenge for us, to be able to maintain."" The state of the city's infrastructure is also a priority for Lefebvre. ""We want more housing. The challenge is we don't have all the infrastructure we need - water, wastewater, and certainly the roads,"" he said. There is provincial funding available for northern municipalities, but there is a cap of $10 million. Lefebvre said he has been advocating for the province to raise that maximum. He said because Greater Sudbury is actually an amalgamated city of seven municipalities, it should qualify for more funding. ""We love that program, but we're capped out at $10 million. We would qualify for about $18 million, but if we were seven municipalities, we would qualify for $10 million each, therefore we would qualify for $70 million,"" Lefebvre argued. Lefebvre said his third priority will be advocating for increased local post-extraction processing of critical minerals. Greater Sudbury is the national powerhouse, he said, with two smelters, two mills and two refineries. ""I believe folks from Sudbury want to see more of that supply chain stay here, so we can have more of the advanced processing,"" he said. ""As we're seeing the USA wanting to onshore more of their manufacturing and using their technology, we should be looking at our own natural resources. In Sudbury, that means our own critical minerals, including nickel, and what more we can do here on the advanced processing side to become that hub, not just for Sudbury, but for Canada and around the world."" Lefebvre said Greater Sudbury has the expertise, land and natural resources to become a global hub, especially with the advent of battery-electric vehicles. PCS LAST HELD SUDBURY IN THE 1980S The Sudbury riding has not been held by a Conservative since the 1980s, when Jim Gordon served (1981-87) under Premiers Bill Davis and Frank Miller, as well as Larry Grossman, who served as leader of the opposition from 1985-87. For nearly 40 years, the Sudbury riding has bounced between the New Democrats and the Liberals. MPP Jamie West has held the Sudbury seat for the NDP since 2018. He is running again, but if predictions are accurate, the blue tide is fast approaching. As of Feb. 23, the Conservatives were leading election forecasts by a significant margin. The website 338canada.com is projecting the PCs will win 45 per cent of seats (give or take four per cent), while the Liberals will take 27 per cent of ridings. The New Democrats are only projected to win 19 per cent of seats and the Green Party of Ontario, six per cent. Locally, 338canada.com says the Sudbury riding is a toss-up between the NDP and Doug Ford's PCs. It also has Nickel Belt leaning NDP. Parties need to win at least 63 seats for a majority; 338canada is projecting the Conservatives will win 91 seats; while the New Democrats will win 19 seats and the Liberals, just 12 seats. The Greens are projected to win two seats. In Sudbury, the Conservatives are represented by entrepreneur Max Massimiliano. Born and raised in Greater Sudbury, Massimiliano is a business owner and community leader. His success ""has been driven by key qualities such as integrity, a strong work ethic and a genuine commitment to his community,"" the PCs note on the party website. ""Widely respected for his leadership, Max is focused on advocating for policies and initiatives that support local economic growth, job creation and health care access, all while ensuring Sudbury remains a great place to live, work and raise a family."" Rashid Mukhtar Choudhry, a local businessman, is running for the Liberals. Born and raised in Pakistan to a family that was involved in politics, Choudhry moved to Canada in 2012. He has owned or managed fast food businesses since his arrival. He is currently proprietor of Smoke's Poutinerie at 40 Elm St. Choudhry said he was compelled to get involved with the Liberals after waiting last summer in the ER at Health Sciences North for more than 10 hours. His young family still has no family doctor and he wants the health care system fixed. The Ontario Health Coalition says more than two million residents of Ontario are without a family physician. ""No matter how anyone tries to spin the numbers, the actual data from sources not tainted by politics show that more than a million Ontarians have lost their family doctor since before the Ford government was elected,"" the Coalition reported on Jan. 27. ""In 2016, before the Ford government was elected, 1.3 million Ontarians did not have a family doctor, according to data from Statistics Canada. By July 2024, there were 2.5 million Ontarians without a family doctor, according to the Ontario College of Family Physicians. The numbers are projected to get worse."" A lack of family doctors is one aspect plaguing the health-care system, but the crisis runs deeper and cuts across various sectors. Attention must be paid to the social determinants of health, the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario argues. The RNAO is calling on the next government to strengthen the social determinants of health by improving access to ""housing, social programs and liveable incomes to foster healthy, equitable, diverse and inclusive communities."" The association, which has a local chapter, wants health care to be prioritized across the province. The RNAO is calling for action on the nursing crisis by retaining registered nurses and nurse practitioners ""with competitive compensation, full-time jobs, education funding and safe work environments."" It also wants the next government to consider the closure of supervised consumption sites. Keeping sites open and accessible saves lives, the association argues. ""With 10 Ontarians dying every day from the illicit drug supply, our leaders must also confront the toxic drug crisis. An essential step: reversing the current plan to close supervised consumption sites is essential,"" the RNAO stated on its website (rnao.ca). It is calling on Queen's Park to ""commit to expanding mental health care - including more harm reduction and treatment services across the province - to save lives and support communities."" The Go-Give Project, which works with Greater Sudbury's more vulnerable population, echoes that sentiment. The organization wants voters to think about which party is best poised to provide more robust options for mental health care and the treatment of addictions. Evie Ali, executive director of the Go-Give Project, said voters should keep in mind a commitment to funding - ""are candidates prior - itizing better access to treatment and support?"" she asked - as well as access to harm reduction services. She also believes better co-ordination of care - with more collaboration amongst hospitals, social services and community organizations - is important. Long wait times are not a barrier only for those suffering from physical ailments. Ali said there is an ""urgent need"" for more healthcare options throughout northeastern Ontario. ""The region has some services in place - like HSN's withdrawal management programs and mental health support - but long wait times and limited accessibility remain major roadblocks for many who need help,"" she commented. ""One of the biggest gaps in care right now is harm reduction services. Earlier this year, Sudbury's supervised consumption site, The Spot, shut down due to funding issues. That site provided a safe place for people to use substances under supervision, reducing overdose risks and connecting users with support services. Without it, there are growing concerns about increased overdoses and the spread of infectious diseases."" Ali said finding solutions to these crises requires a community approach. ""At the end of the day, addiction and mental health challenges don't go away on their own,"" she said. ""The election is a chance for Sudbury residents to push for real solutions that make a difference. The RNAO wants a health care system that is ""accessible, equita- ble, person-centred, integrated, not-for-profit and publicly funded."" It is calling for taxation frameworks that reduce extreme income and wealth inequality. ""It's important to look beyond health care to address the fundamental factors that shape well-being,"" the RNAO commented online. ""This includes building government-owned or non-profit housing; ensuring living wages and strong income supports; investing in quality education and social programs; enhancing sustainable transportation and public spaces; supporting community initiatives; and advancing equity, anti-racism and inclusion. It also requires ensuring health and safety in social media and other digital spaces. How do political candidates plan to address this?"" CLIMATE CHANGE A CONCERN The RNAO is calling on the next government to look beyond the health care portfolio to truly address the crisis currently facing Ontario. As part of its approach, the nursing association wants action on the climate emergency. ""Build a low-carbon, just and equitable economy; phase out fossil fuels; and address pollution to improve health outcomes,"" the RNAO posted on its website. David Robinson, running for the Green Party of Ontario, believes his party is best equipped to tackle the climate crisis. Robinson believes climate change ""is the elephant in the room no other party can address,"" the Green Party of Ontario stated on its website. The economist and retired Laurentian University professor built a career studying economic development in northern Ontario. He initiated and helped establish the McEwen School of Architecture; and his research played an important role in developing the mining supply sector throughout the northeast. A dedicated environmentalist, Robinson still teaches one course per term at LU on the environment. ""When we deal with transient top-of-mind issues, even Trump's tariffs, we have to make sure our solutions bend toward climate adaptation,"" he cautioned on the Green Party website. ""Short-run panic will waste time and undermine our children's future."" Public Health Sudbury and Districts is calling on voters to consider the impact of the public health portfolio when they go to the polls. Investing in public health benefits all residents, the local health unit argues. ""Elections are critical times for us to take stock of where we are as a society and what we should prioritize and invest in for the next few years,"" Dr. Mustafa Hirji, acting medical officer of health, said in a press release published in early February. ""Having just emerged from the worst public health emergency of a generation and facing population health challenges around substance use; resurgent vaccine-preventable infections around the world; and the spectre of an avian influenza pandemic, now is the time to invest in a public health sector that is sustainably funded and positioned to combat these threats."" But public health is reaching a breaking point, the result of a chronic lack of funding combined with increasingly complex concerns. ""Like Public Health, countless other community agencies and individuals across Sudbury and Manitoulin districts rally their efforts every day to respond to community needs, advance community health, promote equity and prevent disease; however, over the past decade, public health funding has not kept pace with inflation, while the population has grown and new mandates have arisen,"" PHSD stated. ""With a continuously shrinking budget, Public Health struggles to deliver on its commitments to the community."" The provincial election takes place on Feb. 27. Besides West, Massimiliano, Robinson and Choudhry, Brady Legault (New Blue Party) and David Popescu (Independent) are running in Sudbury.

"With election day looming in Ontario, opposition parties are in uphill fight against Doug Ford:   Liberals’ Bonnie Crombie, NDP’s Marit Stiles lag behind PC Leader, in snap winter voter amid Trump tariff crisis",2025,"An Ontario Liberal TV ad, which debuted during the fraught U.S.-Canada hockey final last week, depicts a shivering woman on a gurney being left in a hospital parking lot. It asks viewers: ""What happens after the hallways fill up? Stop Doug Ford before we find out."" It’s unclear whether the unusual spot – which was only 14 seconds long and contained no images of Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie – had any impact on Ontario voters before Connor McDavid fired the puck home to defeat the Americans in overtime. The province’s election campaign is now entering the final minutes of its own third period, with voting set for Thursday. And the Liberal ad was just one of many pucks the opposition has tried to aim at Mr. Ford, the Progressive Conservative Leader who has effortlessly blocked almost every shot he has faced, with polls suggesting he could win a historic third majority government. Both Ms. Crombie and NDP Leader Marit Stiles have had their work cut out for them. Both are rookie leaders, facing a snap election in the dead of winter that left them scrambling to nominate candidates and draw up complete platforms, which they both just released in the last few days. They are also facing an electorate fixated on U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs and use ""economic force"" to take over Canada – threats that Mr. Ford has made the central focus of his campaign. His slogan is ""Protect Ontario."" His slick TV ads call him a fighter, while making use of jump-cut clips of his appearances on U.S. news networks. The PC Party picked up the tab for his trips to Washington to lobby lawmakers there, amid complaints they were unfair photo-ops. Mr. Ford’s focused campaign on the tariff threat has made it next-to-impossible for Ms. Stiles and Ms. Crombie to shift to other issues, such as the crisis in the province’s health care system, where they feel Mr. Ford is more vulnerable. His opponents also point to the current RCMP investigation into Mr. Ford’s aborted move to open up parts of the protected Greenbelt to select developers, accusing him of calling an early election to get ahead of any potential charges. But Mr. Ford has remained the first choice for Ontario voters, by double-digit margins in most polls for months – long before he took up his anti-tariff fight and despite public-opinion data also showing low approval ratings for him personally. Nothing in the campaign has significantly moved the needle, not even his ""hot mic"" moment, when he admitted on camera he was ""100 per cent"" happy last November when Mr. Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The resulting campaign has seen Mr. Ford’s two main rivals throw a variety of attacks at the PC Leader, while also setting their sights on each other. The 65-year-old Ms. Crombie, who won her party’s leadership in December, 2023, has faced an uphill struggle to revive Ontario’s Liberals, often jokingly called the ""minivan party"" because they had just nine seats in the legislature after two disastrous elections. But she rejuvenated the party’s fundraising and insisted on tacking less to the left and more to the centre-right. She has been taking increasingly aggressive shots at Mr. Ford, calling his notion of a $60-billion to $120-billion tunnel under Highway 401 ""dumb"" and a ""fantasy"" in the televised leaders’ debate. She has also made fixing health care her main theme, promising everyone in Ontario access to a family doctor in four years and saying she’d spend $3-billion to do it. And she has pledged a broad-based tax cut – something Mr. Ford said he would do in 2018 but never delivered. From almost the moment she stepped into the role, the former mayor of Mississauga and former federal Liberal MP has faced a relentless campaign of PC Party attack ads. Mr. Ford routinely calls her the ""queen of the carbon tax,"" though she now says she disapproves of the federal fuel charge. Recently published opinion polls have shown her pulling ahead of the NDP in the popular vote, but still well behind Mr. Ford’s PCs. Her campaign, hurt by a rush to vet and nominate candidates, has hit some rough spots. She was forced to jettison her Oshawa candidate over an inflammatory and homophobic 2023 social-media post about the killing of B.C. Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Ms. Crombie, who did not have a seat in the legislature, is running for one in Mississauga. In last week’s leaders’ debate, she pleaded with NDP voters to back the Liberals, saying she was the only leader who could beat Mr. Ford. Ms. Stiles dismissed it as a desperate ploy as the Liberals seek to regain the 12 seats required for official party status in the legislature. The Liberals are also running geographically targeted digital ads in close ridings, making the same appeal to NDP supporters thinking of switching. One Toronto NDP candidate, in Eglinton-Lawrence, had already dropped out on her own to support the Liberal there. Ms. Crombie has also tried to connect to voters by sharing her life story. Speaking to a Canadian Club business luncheon at the Royal York hotel last week, she pointed to rising homelessness under Mr. Ford and announced a commitment to fully fund mental health care. And she choked up as she recounted the alcoholism, homelessness and early death of her own estranged biological father in a Toronto shelter. ""My dad was living at Seaton House, not far from here,"" she said, pacing the stage. ""And he was dying. His addiction that had taken his family, and his home, and was now claiming his life."" At the same time last Thursday, Ms. Stiles was giving a pep talk to about 40 volunteers jammed into the storefront serving as headquarters for the NDP candidate in the Liberal-held east-end Toronto riding of Beaches-East York. The Newfoundland-born Ms. Stiles, 55, is Ontario’s Official Opposition Leader – but for how long depends on election night. The NDP had 28 seats at dissolution, compared to the Liberals’ nine. In 2022, the NDP captured about four times as many seats as the Liberals, despite the two parties tying in the popular vote with 24 per cent. But recent polls show the NDP trailing Ms. Crombie’s party. Ms. Stiles, a former union policy adviser and school trustee who was acclaimed to her current post in 2023, says her party is still running to win. She says the NDP is focusing on what she calls ""orange/blue"" ridings, in Niagara, and Southwestern and Northern Ontario – where she says her party is in head-to-head battles with the PCs. Liberal campaigners charge that Ms. Stiles, MPP for Toronto’s Davenport, is actually focused on saving existing NDP seats threatened by the inroads Mr. Ford has made through winning the endorsement of construction and skilled trades worker unions. The NDP accuses the Liberals of similarly focusing on its traditional toeholds. ""I think Bonnie Crombie and the Liberals have kind of given up the fight. Doug Ford quit as premier. I never give up. I will not stop fighting. I will not quit,"" Ms. Stiles tells reporters before hopping over the snowbanks on Danforth Avenue to climb back aboard her orange campaign bus. ""I am running to be the premier of this province."" Her party usually enjoys an advantage in attracting volunteers, including from its union supporters, that could help it get out its vote in what is expected to be a low-turnout election. While decrying Mr. Ford’s deals with ""insiders,"" her campaign has largely focused on trying to present Ms. Stiles as a trustworthy, down-to-earth leader who would fight to protect Ontario jobs from Mr. Trump while putting billions more into health care and schools. On housing, she has promised to get the government involved directly in building affordable homes and enforcing strict rent controls. She has also pledged to hand out monthly grocery-price rebate cheques for low- and middle-income families, and vowed to make the privately run and tolled Highway 407 free – without explaining how. With promises squarely aimed at voters’ wallets, both opposition leaders have in some ways borrowed from the playbook of Mr. Ford, who rarely misses a chance to crow about the licence-plate sticker fees he cancelled in 2022, or his distaste for road tolls. The 60-year-old PC Leader, who launched his hastily conceived 2018 campaign for his party’s leadership from his mother’s basement, is now on the verge of winning three majority governments in a row – which would make him the first Ontario premier to do so since fellow Tory Leslie Frost in 1959. After running the U.S. branch of the family label-printing business, Mr. Ford rose to prominence as a Toronto city councillor during the tumultuous mayoralty of his brother Rob Ford, who made global headlines a decade ago for erratic behaviour and alcohol and drug abuse, and died of cancer in 2016. After unsuccessfully taking over his ailing brother’s re-election run, Doug Ford soon turned his sights to provincial politics, when then-PC leader Patrick Brown was forced to resign in a scandal. Mr. Ford would lead the PCs to victory over then-Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne in 2018, and he would win again in 2022. While he has claimed he needed a snap election to secure a new mandate to deal with Mr. Trump, Mr. Ford and his advisers had been mulling an early election since at least last spring, when he announced hundreds of millions of dollars to speed up the introduction of beer sales in corner stores. In the fall, he laid more groundwork, announcing that he would send out $200 cheques to most taxpayers despite still running deficits. His campaign has been relentless in its focus on fighting the threatened tariffs and boosting the economy, including pledges to spend billions to cushion the blow for Ontario companies. Some seat projections based on polling data last week suggested he could win more than 90 of the legislature’s 124 seats, up from his current 79. Mike Schreiner, Leader of the Green Party of Ontario, is hoping to hang on to the party’s two seats. One common enemy all the campaigns have faced is the weather. Over the roar of traffic on a snowdrift-lined street in Etobicoke, Liberal candidate John Campbell says Mr. Ford’s snap election in February seems aimed at keeping people from voting at all. ""It’s hard to put up signs. It’s hard to make your way along sidewalks. People don’t want to have the door open,"" says the former city councillor, who is taking on PC cabinet minister Kinga Surma. ""It’s anti-democratic, really, to have it at the worst time of year.""

"Ontario Election 2025: NDP leader pledges Windsor school repair, transit, E.C. Row funding in final campaign push",2025,"An NDP government would tackle the local region's $405-million school repair backlog, cover half of Transit Windsor's operating budget, and upload responsibility of E.C. Row Expressway upkeep from the city to the province, NDP Leader Marit Stiles pledged on a Windsor campaign stop on Monday. With an election just days away, the head of Ontario's main opposition party made a final campaign push in Windsor, touting her party's position on health care, affordability, rent control, and jobs. ""These are ridings that we want to hold,"" Stiles told reporters in Windsor West, the only riding this side of London that is not Tory blue. ""You can see it from the folks that are out today. There's a lot of excitement here, a lot of momentum. We're feeling people here want change, and they know firsthand what the cost of Doug Ford and the conservatives would be."" A crowd of about 60 supporters gathered at Lanspeary Park waved orange signs and cheered as Stiles stepped off her campaign bus. Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles speaks at Lanspeary Park in Windsor on Monday afternoon. Stiles was joined by local NDP candidates, including MPP Lisa Gretzky for Windsor West, Gemma Grey-Hall for Windsor-Tecumseh, and Rachael Mills for Essex. Also in attendance was MP Brian Masse, the federal NDP representative for Windsor West. One of Stiles' key promises during her brief Windsor visit was to strengthen Ontario's health-care system and increase the number of family doctors - particularly in Windsor-Essex, where nearly 47,000 residents are without one. Addressing the rising cost of living is also at the top of the NDP agenda. ""You know what people want? They want us to address the rising cost of food, the rent increases that are forcing people to lose their homes,"" said Stiles. ""They're wondering when they're going to get a family doctor and how long they're going to have to wait in emergency rooms if they're even open. They're wondering where they're going to find affordable homes to live in. ""They're seeing jobs flee the province. So, to me, this is just another example of Doug Ford not being in touch with where Ontarians are at."" Stiles outlined the NDP plan to introduce a monthly grocery rebate, rent control protections, and increased provincial funding for public transportation, which would include covering 50 per cent of operating costs for Transit Windsor. She pledged to upload the E.C. Row Expressway back to provincial management and address the region's $405-million repair backlog across all four school boards in the area.

Stiles also took aim at Premier Doug Ford, who called the election a year early to secure a stronger mandate from Ontarians to navigate the next four years of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs. After a month-long pause, Trump on Monday said he will still move forward with a 25 per cent tariff on most imports from Canada starting next week. ""Hell of a lot of good Doug Ford did for us, right?"" said Stiles. WINDSOR.

NDP government is legislating my family out of B.C,2025,"A commentary by a Saanich resident. I've lived in B.C. my whole life. I grew up in Kamloops, my wife in Chilliwack. We moved to Saanich in the 1990s, bought a house and raised our family. We had hoped to retire in this home, and had a plan to do so. With the kids gone, our empty nest got a redesign in hopes of making enough money to stay here, as Saanich property taxes grew faster than our income. Then the NDP government came to power and started to change the rules. It started during COVID where there was no grounds for an eviction. Predictably, this gave permission for bad renters to abuse landlords, and they did. If we have another pandemic the risk to us would be too great. This was followed by more rules brought in on July 2024. Here is one of the most concerning, but by no means the only one. Landlords found ending tenancies in ""bad faith"", may be ordered to pay the tenant up to 12 months' rent. In our case, rent was $2,000 per month, this penalty could total $24,000 after tax dollars. ""Bad faith"" was to be determined by the heavily biased rental tenancy board. The NDP then mandated a maximum rent increase of zero in 2021, 1.5% in 2022, and 2% in 2023. As everyone knows, price increases from 2021 to 2023 far exceeded 3.5%. It was closer to 20%. This guaranteed we would be making less, and losing more as time went by. It also made investing into the unit impossible as materials and labour had exploded in price but our rent stayed essentially the same. These dictates by the NDP government made renting our home far too risky, as we have the majority of our savings tied up in our home. One bad renter that can't be evicted is a nightmare every landlord lives in fear of, and too many have had experience with. So, we decided to put our unit on Airbnb. We invested in furniture, appliances, bedding, TVs etc., put in a great deal of time and work, and got it on the market in 2024. We made exactly $30,619 gross, less after expenses. So we're not exactly getting rich doing this, but it allowed us to pay our bills and stay in our home. Now the NDP has changed the rules again with the ""registry for short-term rentals."" This new registry adds more fees and red tape, a snitch line, a new government department staffed with bureaucrats, and an increased schedule of fines. Unfortunately for anyone in my municipality, they will not be given ""permission"" by Saanich to rent their own property shortterm. So, in short, the government just legislated us out of business. With renting made too risky, and with Airbnb being outlawed in May, it leaves me facing the horrific prospect of selling my precious family home and moving to Alberta. To my mother who moved to the Island to be closer to me in her old age, I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. Maybe the NDP will look after you.","Times - Colonist; Victoria, B.C.","Victoria, B.C.","Green, Richard",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 22, 2025",Lessors; Bad faith; Evictions; Rentals,Nom: Airbnb; NAICS: 561599,2025-02-22,Times - Colonist
NDP stretching to stay flexible,2025,"Premier David Eby was mildly teased this week in the legislature about his hot yoga routine. It was raised to key to the question: ""What is more flexible, his promises or his principles?"" Turns out he'd gone to yoga earlier in the morning. He laughed it off with: ""I had a good stretch. It helps with the heart rate during question period."" Eby recommended it to the entire legislature and it is sound advice, because B.C. politicians are going to be going through contortions that were unimaginable just a few months ago as U.S. President Donald Trump contemplates starving Canada into submission. The stretching and twisting is already well underway. The NDP is folding most of its re-election campaign platform and stuffing it in a closet. The government continued the trend by reversing course and retooling the dangerous drug safe supply program this week. There will be more to come. Finance Minister Brenda Bailey is fresh off snatching the $1,000 grocery rebate back from voters and putting a even bigger tax rebate on the back burner (with the burner switched off). ""The world changed,"" she told the legislature. ""We cannot move forward..."" She also has a new twist on the NDP's new emergency drive to boost the homegrown economy in the face of open acrossthe-board hostility from B.C.'s largest trading partner. Eighteen major energy and mining projects in lengthy approval processes were put on a fast track this month. But Bailey told the legislature this week that doesn't mean automatic yeses. ""While we accelerate these important projects that we have brought forward, acceleration doesn't necessarily mean only getting to yes. ""Acceleration can also mean getting to no, because we are still keeping the vital, vital protection of environment and collaboration with Indigenous peoples as our guiding lights on these decisions. ""What we're getting rid of is death by maybe."" The NDP spent several years adroitly using those processes to drag out the Trans Mountain Pipeline project that it firmly opposed. (Since ""the world changed,"" that pipeline now could turn out to be lifeline.) And a certain amount of dithering after they took power in 2017 added to the cost and delays on the Site C Clean Energy Project, which they opposed, then grudgingly completed. It too takes on much more importance in the new ""all Trump, all the time"" universe. That respect for due process and review after review is being replaced by a hurry-up offence. There's a certain appeal to getting rid of ""death by maybe."" But some of that $20 billion worth of development is going to get shelved if Bailey is intent on respecting environmental protection and Indigenous consultation, even while barging ahead. A faster no is more efficient. But it is still a no. It's going to be a tightrope walk. Good thing yoga is good for your balance. Another example of the contortions underway comes from Tourism Minister Spencer Chandra Herbert. About a quarter of tourists in B.C. are from international markets, and most of that share are from the U.S. In normal times that would be a recipe for a boom. Everything in Canada is 30 per cent off, due to the slump in the dollar. But Chandra Herbert described the source of that revenue stream as ""our neighbour, who is a friend, now saying: 'We're not a friend anymore, and we're coming for you. We're coming for your things. We want what you have and we don't want to listen to you.' That is a serious threat. ... It's something we have to be ready for and it's something we're going to have to deal with..."" Chandra Herbert said ""we certainly welcome"" U.S. visitors. But there's never been a time when politics was more likely to get in the way of friendly dayto-day encounters with people south of the border. Driving a Tesla with U.S. plates around B.C. these days is not as much fun as it used to be. It's going to take some more stretching to make a marketing campaign work. Just So You Know: There used to be a sign reading ""Yoga Room"" in the old armoury building behind the legislature. By the time the tariff threat shakes down, it could be filled with politicians trying to become double-jointed when it comes to matching past stances with current realities.

NDP further damages credibility with secret land management deal; Pact with shÃ•shálh on Sunshine Coast not made public until after B.C. election,2025,"On the eve of the last B.C. election, the New Democrats signed an agreement affecting Aboriginal title and Indigenous management of land and resources on the Sunshine Coast. However, Premier David Eby chose not to make the 44-page text - or even the fact of its existence - public until after the election was over. The agreement was only released Jan. 29 of this year, five months after the signing on Aug. 16 and three months after the NDP's narrow one-seat, 22-vote election victory. The news release announced that the shíshálh (Sechelt) Nation and the B.C. government had amended their landmark reconciliation agreement reached back in 2018. The reconciliation agreement covers the traditional territory of the shíshálh Nation: 5,000 square kilometres along the Sunshine Coast, flanking Jervis and Sechelt inlets and including Sechelt, Halfmoon Bay, Earl's Cove, Madeira Park, Lang Bay, Roberts Creek, Nelson Island and part of Texada. The accompanying fact sheet said the revised agreement ""allows for transformative change to take place in a struc- tured way that is transparent."" ""Transparent"" is an odd way to describe an agreement signed in secret a month before the election campaign and sat on until months after the votes were counted. Signing for the shíshálh were Chief Lenora Joe and two councillors. Signing for the province were then cabinet ministers Murray Rankin (Indigenous relations and reconciliation) and Nathan Cullen (water, land and resource stewardship). Cullen was involved in an earlier example of the NDP's secretive approach to dealing with Indigenous nations on public land and resources. This time last year, he presided over a government plan to amend the Land Act to expedite joint management of public land and resources with the province's 200 recognized Indigenous nations. It was billed as an exercise in ""public engagement,"" though Cullen failed to advise the public that he was engaging it. The plan was to change the legislation before the election. The backlash was such that Cullen had to abandon it, all the while indicating that the New Democrats would resume the path once the election was over. Cullen's involvement in this second exercise in secrecy has already drawn attention on the Sunshine Coast, as reflected in a letter to the premier from the Pender Harbour and Area Residents Association. ""We are deeply concerned that your government has signed an agreement with the shíshálh Nation, committing to negotiate recognition of Aboriginal title within its traditional territory and to explore exclusive decision-making powers for the nation,"" said the Feb. 19 missive. ""It is inconceivable that local residents were not consulted on - or even advised of - the negotiation of this agreement until after the fact. And what is even a greater concern is that this agreement was signed by your ministers two months before the last provincial election but not disclosed publicly until months after."" The association posed several questions to the premier, including whether the government would pledge to ""exclude private lands from any areas where Aboriginal title may be negotiated."" It also asked whether Randene Neill, the NDP's winning candidate in Powell River-Sunshine Coast, ""was aware of the agreement before she was elected."" Neill won handily with almost 50 per cent of the vote. She was later appointed the successor to Cullen (who lost his seat) as min- ister of water, land and resource stewardship. I asked her last week why the government delayed release until after the election. She said she would get back to me, but has not yet done sO. I did get an answer from the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, on behalf of new minister Christine Boyle. She's the successor to Rankin, who retired. Her ministry blamed the holdup in releasing the agreement to the short time frame between the Aug. 16 signing and the Sept. 21 issuing of the election writs, which put the government into caretaker mode. ""Both B.C. and shíshálh wanted to appropriately celebrate the renewal of the Foundation Agreement,"" said the statement. ""However there wasn't time to do so before interregnum. Once the new government was sworn in, a date was chosen."" The ministry also maintained that the agreement was not really anything new. ""This is the renewal of the existing 25-year Foundation Agreement that we signed in 2018. It is not a new agreement. In fact, this work began in 2016 under former minister responsible, John Rustad."" Nice try. But in at least two noticeable respects, the amendment goes beyond the 2016 and 2018 agreements. One is a potentially far-reaching commitment to ""negotiate and attempt to reach agreement recognizing the shíshálh Nation's Aboriginal title"" within the above defined traditional territory. Another provision opens the province to ""negotiation of shíshálh exclusive decision-making"" within five years. During the election campaign, the premier promised not to reintroduce the amendments to the Land Act. He said the New Democrats first needed ""to make sure that we have the confidence of British Columbians in this critically important work."" Judging from this latest exercise in secrecy, he and his ministers still have a long way to go to establish any credibility on that score. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 22, 2025",Public lands; Agreements; Provincial elections; Native peoples; Negotiations; Decision making; Reconciliation,,2025-02-22,The Vancouver Sun
Candidate with 'desire' to be Black quits race; Ontario election Part-time prof was running for NDP,2025,"L ON D ON, ON T. . An Ontario NDP candidate who said she secretly wanted to be a Black woman has ended her campaign for election to Queen's Park next week. Amanda Zavitz, who was running in the riding of Elgin-Middlesex-London, posted on social media she was quitting because of comments she made in a lecture in New York that surfaced this past week. ""After further reflection and discussions with community members, I have decided to resign as the Ontario NDP candidate for the upcoming election,"" Zavitz said in a Facebook post. ""It has become clear that my past comments are distracting from the critical task of defeating Doug Ford and electing an Ontario NDP government."" A part-time professor of sociology at Western University and business owner, Zavitz's resignation came a day after the Progressive Conservatives quoted comments she made about her ""secret desire"" to be a Black woman and her views on capitalism in a news release. Zavitz, who is white, said in a video of her talk that has been taken down from YouTube, ""My secret is that I want to be a Black woman. ... because I think Black is much more beautiful,"" she says. ""The easy answer is that I want to be bell hooks (an American author), and bell hooks was a Black woman."" Zavitz also said she wished she had lived experiences of poverty and addiction. The PCs accused Zavitz of ""trivializing"" the life experi - ence of Black Ontarians. NDP Leader Marit Stiles called Zavitz's original comments ""deeply concerning"" before her resignation was announced. Zavitz is the second NDP candidate to withdraw from the Feb. 27 election. Natasha Doyle-Merrick stepped down Feb. 14 in Eglinton-Lawrence and threw her support behind the Liberals in a bid to prevent the PCs from winning in a tight race. The Progressive Conservatives have dug up dirt on a series of Liberal candidates over the past week, but have also been turning their attention to NDP candidates as well, branding them as ""radical."" Zavitz's departure from the race leaves six candidates vying for the seat that Progressive Conservative candidate Rob Flack won with more than 50 per cent of the vote in the 2022 election.

"Canada flag insert in newspaper was welcome surprise I would ...[Derived Headline ] :   Ontario NDP candidate withdraws in Eglinton-Lawrence, citing close PC-Liberal race, Feb. 14 Fans at 4 Nations boo U.S. anthem before three fights open spirited U.S.-Canada game, Feb. 15",2025,"Canada flag insert in newspaper was welcome surprise I would like to thank the Star for including a full-page Canadian flag in last Saturday's issue. I don't consider myself a flag-waver and generally display my patriotism verbally. I do, however, own an enormous Canadian flag that once flew over Centre Block on Parliament Hill and that was presented to me after 40 years of military service. Although I am extremely proud to own it, it is too large for me to display. Hence my delight upon opening the Star and discovering the full-colour flag. I felt a surge of national pride and immediately taped the paper version to my front door. Thank you, Canada. Maurice Sacco, Toronto Thank you for the Canadian flag insert in the Saturday Star. The closest thing we had previously was our Air Canada luggage tags. We tried to buy a flag when everyone was encouraged to show solidarity, but no surprise, everything was sold out. So instead, we taped the Star insert to one of our windows in honour of Flag Day, and we've decided to leave it there indefinitely. We're not the types who would ever even display a lawn sign during an election, but this moment feels different. Nancy Miller, Toronto NDP candidate shows leadership Ontario NDP candidate withdraws in Eglinton-Lawrence, citing close PC-Liberal race, Feb. 14 NDP hopeful Natasha Doyle-Merrick provided some badly needed leadership by withdrawing her candidacy in Eglinton-Lawrence to give the Liberal candidate a better chance of defeating their Progressive Conservative rival in the upcoming Ontario election. We need this kind of leadership from progressive candidates now more than ever. It's high time the provincial and federal progressive parties united and formed a common front against the conservative parties, which are moving more to the right. As author Susan Weiman writes in her recent book ""The Left Is Not Woke,"" progressive movements need to stop fighting among themselves and unite. We need to do this in Ontario and Canada before it's too late. Joanne Clarke, Toronto Better ways to protest than booing the U.S. anthem Fans at 4 Nations boo U.S. anthem before three fights open spirited U.S.-Canada game, Feb. 15 I vehemently disagree with the idea of booing the U.S. national anthem at sporting events. However, I do think Canadian fans are right to show some displeasure. I've seen some situations in which people who want to protest something simply turn their backs on it. I think if Canadian fans were to turn their backs on the United States flag and remain absolutely silent while the anthem played, that would be a highly effective form of protest. Michael Neill, Thornhill What's up with Canadians booing the U.S. national anthem? If you have a beef with President Donald Trump, then boo him - don't boo the American people, who, for the most part, love our Canadian neighbours. Like you, most of us would prefer that Canada remain Canada and not become the 51st state. Americans and Canadians have always gotten along like siblings, so let's try to keep it that way and keep politics out of this. John Lemandri, Williamsburg, Va. The past few weeks have been very troubling for Canadians, given what Trump is imposing on our country and our people. It's not only the tariffs; it's also the insulting things he says about Canada. The result: Trump has unwittingly united us. However, booing the U.S. national anthem is wrong. The American people are not at fault. It's Trump who is taking these actions and making outrageous statements. The NHL and NBA players are not the cause of your anger: they're simply doing their job. If you choose to watch the game at home or in person, please show respect for the anthems and show your displeasure in other ways. Let's show the world that Canadians are better this. Please stand, remove your hat and either sing or stay quiet while the anthems play. Susan Beals, Richmond Hill I completely understand the sentiment of Canadian fans booing American teams at sporting events. It's a way to let Trump and his ilk know how we feel and, really, how often do we really get the chance to express ourselves in a way that reaches so many people? I don't like to hear it, though, as it seems very rude and lowers us to a level that we Canadians don't generally stoop to. I wonder whether there might be a more gentle (dare I say polite?) or less mean way to convey our ire. How about we decline to sing their anthem, and instead stay silent and turn our backs to the whole event? Annie Barrett, Alliston, Ont. Kudos to those dedicated paper delivery people I would like to shout out my thanks to the delivery people who are doing such a great job despite these snowy conditions. In particular, I want to single out our Star delivery person. Here in Collingwood, we always get more snow than folk down south, but this year it's been far worse than usual. This morning, my driveway was literally impassible, and I feared the worst for our copy of the newspaper. I was amazed to see what happened next: it was apparent that our delivery person had stopped on the road and walked the paper to our very front door. Much appreciated, and beyond the call of duty!

"Ford’s education funding vow isn’t enough: opposition:   Ontario NDP, Liberals say provincial Tories have left too many schools in need of repair",2025,"With a provincial election in Ontario less than a week away, the Ford government’s promise to spend more than $1-billion to build new schools is not nearly enough to meet the needs across the province, opposition parties say. Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party has not yet released any election platform details regarding its plans for education. But just before calling the election last month, Mr. Ford’s government promised $1.3-billion to build 30 new schools and expand 15 already existing schools across the province. Combined, the projects will create 25,000 new student spaces, the province said. The funding is part of the government’s commitment to spend $16-billion over the next 10 years to support new school construction, renewal and improvement projects. But the Ontario NDP and Liberal parties say the Ford government has failed to adequately fund education, leaving too many students to learn in portables and too many schools in need of repair. “With a growing population we need new schools, but we also need the schools that our kids are in now to be safe, healthy environments, and unfortunately too many of them are not,” says Chandra Pasma, the Ontario NDP’s education critic. NDP Leader Marit Stiles has promised to spend an additional $830-million per year to clear the school repair backlog within 10 years. That backlog is significant. A December report from Financial Accountability Office of Ontario estimated that it would cost $21.7-billion to clear the infrastructure backlog and maintain all school buildings in a state of good repair over the next decade. The report also said that it would cost $9.8-billion to build new schools to address permanent capacity pressures during that same period. The number of students in Ontario is growing – the report says more than 170,000 student spaces will need to be built by the 2033 school year to meet projected enrolment growth – and overcrowding is already a widespread issue: 35.2 per cent of schools in the English Catholic system and 29.7 per cent of schools in the English public system are currently over capacity. Of the 10 largest school boards in Ontario, the Durham District School Board has the highest proportion of overcapacity schools, with 69.2 per cent of schools operating above 100-per-cent utilization, followed by the Thames Valley District School Board, at 40.6 per cent, according to the report. As boards struggle with capacity issues, more than one-third of schools are in need of repairs, the report says. The problem is particularly severe at the Toronto District School Board, where 84.1 per cent of schools are in need of repairs. At the Thames Valley District School Board, 52.5 per cent of schools need repairs, the report says. Ontario Education Minister Jill Dunlop says the Ford government has prioritized building schools quickly. “Under our plan, schools are being built faster and more efficiently than ever before so more students have access to a place to learn and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow,” she said in a press release. But the Ontario Liberal Party says schools are not being built quickly enough to meet the needs of overcrowding. “Every single kid in Ontario needs and deserves to learn in a safe, functioning school environment. This has not been the case in Doug Ford’s Ontario. After years of underinvestment by Ford’s Conservatives, almost one in 10 kids in Ontario are taking their classes in a portable,” Taylor Deasley, a spokesperson for Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie, said in an e-mail. The FAO report found that there are nearly 1,500 schools across the province that are over capacity. The report estimates that to address capacity pressures, the province would need to build the equivalent of 227 new schools over the next decade. Kathleen Woodcock, president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, says that while the government’s promise to build new schools is welcome news, any future provincial government needs to do more in order to help boards across the province address their infrastructure costs. In particular, she says, lifting the moratorium that has barred boards from closing or merging schools since 2017 would help relieve the significant financial pressures they are struggling with. “It’s an unsustainable situation to have that moratorium because it has created funding deficits,” Ms. Woodcock says. “It costs the same to clean, maintain and keep the lights on in any school whether it’s half-full or full.” The Toronto District School Board, the largest school board in Canada, has also asked the province to lift the moratorium, which would save the TDSB “millions of dollars,” board chair Neethan Shan says. “We have asked the provincial government to allow us to lift the moratorium, and they don’t have to do it provincially,” he says. “They can make it specific to the city of Toronto if they are worried about other parts of the province because there’s a lot of money that we lose by not consolidating projects.” The province has consistently said that families do not want schools to close. None of the five capital projects the TDSB submitted for consideration were approved for funding under the province’s $1.3-billion plan. Lifting the moratorium would allow the board to spend money more efficiently, Mr. Shan says. “There are buildings that are underutilized and are being maintained at a cost of millions of dollars that could go towards programs.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Mcginn, Dave",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 22, 2025",Provincial elections; Local elections; Moratoriums; Students; Funding; Learning; Education; School boards,Nom: Toronto District School Board; NAICS: 611110,2025-02-22,The Globe and Mail
"Ontario NDP, Liberals release election platforms, promise billions in new spending",2025,"TORONTO - Ontario's NDP and Liberals are both pledging tens of billions of dollars in new spending to pay for their campaign promises, but are taking different approaches to the other side of the ledger, with the NDP proposing wealth taxes and the Liberals eyeing ""efficiencies.""

The party estimates that new tax brackets for those earning $300,000, $400,000 and $500,000 a year would bring in about $3 billion per year. It also says increasing the amount of capital gains subject to tax from 50 per cent to 80 per cent would bring in about $3.5 billion per year, and increasing the provincial land transfer tax rate on homes purchased for $3 million or more would see $33 million a year in revenue. NDP Leader Marit Stiles had already announced the bulk of the party's promises ahead of the platform release, including a monthly grocery rebate, connecting everyone to a family doctor, establishing a public builder for 300,000 affordable homes and creating a universal school food program. The NDP would put $10.5 billion over three years into public health - including their promise to attach everyone to team-based primary care. Their home-building plan would cost $7.5 billion over three years and their grocery rebate would cost $11 billion over that time. Doubling disability support payments and Ontario Works payments would cost nearly $23 billion over three years. Spending on education would increase by $13 billion over three years, not including spending $830 million per year to address a school maintenance backlog. And a group of promises to increase transit funding, implement a caregiver benefit, eliminate hospital parking fees and reduce home heating costs would add up to $4.8 billion over three years. Stiles wrote in a press release accompanying the platform that it's her plan for a better Ontario. ""As premier, I will fight against rising costs, freeze taxes, hire doctors, build homes you can afford and fix local schools,"" she wrote. ""I'll lead a government that will always be on your side."" Ontario's Liberals are promising $65 billion in new spending over four years, along with finding more than $28 billion in efficiencies, in a platform they say contains no new taxes or tax increases. Crombie also highlighted some previously unannounced promises on education in the platform, including building 90 new schools, establishing a lower student-to-teacher ratio and shortening teachers' college programs to one year to alleviate the teacher shortage. ""Our school system used to be the envy of the world, our elementary, our post-secondary, and it's really failed over the last seven years under Doug Ford,"" Crombie said. ""We see our classrooms overcrowded, our schools crumbling. Our young people are spilling out into portables."" Crombie also said she would consider lifting a school closure moratorium, ""if it makes more sense to close a school and build another one elsewhere."" The Liberal platform estimates that their health-care promises, including attaching every Ontarian to a family doctor, would cost $29 billion over four years. A group of promises including home building, responding to tariffs and implementing tax cuts are costed at $26 billion over four years, though a more specific breakdown was not available.

"NDP Finally admit the truth about diversion; Eby's government has pounced on every opportunity to deny, evade and cover up",2025,"The New Democrats halted the free and easy distribution of safer-supply drugs this week after two years of denying that the drugs were being diverted to an illicit market overseen by organized crime. Henceforth, safer-supply drugs can only be consumed under the direct supervision of health care professionals, ending the openair markets that flourished outside the entrances to legitimate pharmacies across the province. ""We are requiring that the use of prescribed alternatives must be witnessed by a health professional ... ensuring that they are consumed by their intended recipient,"" said the announcement, using the NDP's preferred term (""prescribed alternatives"") for safer supply drugs. ""This will remove the risk of these medications from ending up in the hands of gangs and organized crime."" The statement from Health Minister Josie Osborne Wednesday marked the first time the New Democrats had publicly admitted the involvement of organized crime in the diversion of safer-supply drugs. Osborne issued the statement at midday, shortly before the first question period of the new legislature session. In question period, the New Democrats faced a proper roasting over a leaked Health Ministry document that confirmed safer supply drugs ""are not being consumed by their intended recipients"" and ""are trafficked provincially, nationally and internationally."" Leading the challenge was Opposition MLA Elenore Sturko. She's the former RCMP officer who first raised concerns about diversion of safer-supply drugs in February 2023. Outside the house, Sturko was briefly overcome with emotion by Osborne's belated admission. ""It made me think of the first time that a parent had called me and their child had died of a fentanyl overdose and they found these safe supply pills in the room,"" Sturko told reporters. ""Their child had started their path to addiction from diverted safe supply."" The government's reversal meant vindication for Sturko and those journalists who persisted in detailing the diversion of safer-supply drugs. Still, the New Democrats will not concede that their critics were right. True to form for Osborne. When Sturko released the leaked report two weeks ago, the health minister claimed it could compromise an ongoing investigation into the diversion of safer-supply drugs. ""It is just appalling that this would be done by the Opposition,"" fumed Osborne, blaming the leaker over her own government's coverup of the evidence. She stuck to that line of defence Wednesday, claiming the New Democrats had been on the case since last year and were focusing on several dozen ""bad actor"" pharmacies that were profiting from safer supply. Sturko fired back that the greater problem was a government that failed to exercise proper control and scrutiny over the distribution, diversion and resale of dangerous and lucrative drugs. Premier David Eby, in defend- ing the NDP response, cited a statement from the provincial association of chiefs of police that was delivered into his hands in the midst of question period. The chiefs had approved the government's switch to ""witnessed ingestion"" of safer-supply drugs, Eby told the house. The police chiefs said that while harm-reduction efforts matter, ""it is equally essential that these programs are structured in a way that prevents unintended consequences, including the illegal redistribution of prescribed substances."" Eby: ""We agree entirely. That's why we've taken the step of moving to witnessed ingestion. It is a challenging decision because we know it will limit access of some people to the program, but it's a necessary step, and I'm glad to have the support of the police."" The premier and his colleagues got a greater helping hand from the police this time last year. Back then, news organizations were picking up on reports from RCMP detachments in Prince George and elsewhere about the burgeoning diversion of and illicit trade in safer-supply drugs. Then came a March 11, 2024, internal RCMP memo that directed detachments to route all communications through headquarters on ""hot button"" issues, including drug seizures, decriminalization and the like. Detachments were warned against speaking publicly about ""controversial or high-profile topics ... in the pre-election time period."" The quasi-gag order was reported publicly by Fran Yanor of the Northern Beat online news service. She also found that the RCMP detachments that had confirmed the diversion of safer-supply drugs were now routing her questions through headquarters. The disruption of the flow of information to the news media allowed then Public Safety Min- ister Mike Farnworth to claim that ""police have no evidence to suggest there is widespread diversion of safe supply drugs."" In short, NDP policy amounted to ""don't ask, don't tell - and especially don't tell the news media."" For all Eby's insistence this week that the New Democrats won't stand for diversion, they stood by it for two years despite whistle-blowing by Sturko and news organizations. The premier and his ministers had likewise discounted the problems of open drug use until belatedly conceding last year that it had to be curbed. It has become a pattern with this government's failing experiment in drug decriminalization. The New Democrats do, finally, grudgingly, get around to acknowledging the problem and fixing it. But only after they have exhausted all the opportunities for denial, evasion and coverup. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 21, 2025",Drugs; Organized crime; Decriminalization; News media; Pharmacy,,2025-02-21,The Vancouver Sun
"NDP Sees 'deadly' slide in polls; Tory, Liberal support steadies",2025,"O T TAWA . For the first time since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation last month, a new poll shows Canadian politics experiencing a rare phenomenon: stability. A Postmedia-Leger survey found the Conservatives leading with 41 per cent support, the Liberals in second with 33 per cent support and the NDP's support plunging to 11 per cent. The poll found NDP support falling three percentage points since last week, with a one-point rise in Conservative support and a two-point rise in Liberal support. ""If you're the Conservatives, it's good news because the shifting seems to be plateauing right now. If the election were held today it would be Trudeau against (Conservative Leader Pierre) Poilievre,"" said Sébastien Dallaire, Leger's executive vice-president of Eastern Canada. ""Right now, voting intentions have moved signifi- cantly in recent weeks, and this is the first poll where we see a little bit more stability,"" he said. While both the Liberals and the Conservatives could find good news in the survey, the NDP's decline marks a five percentage point decrease in support over the past two weeks. ""The slide for the NDP has continued,"" Dallaire said. ""The NDP has been on this deadly steady downward trajectory. It's as if voters now are looking into who's going to be in the best position to defend us against (U.S. President) Donald Trump. ""We have two contenders at this point and (NDP Leader) Jagmeet Singh hasn't been able to invite himself to the party,"" said Dallaire. In September, Singh ripped up his supply-and-confidence agreement with the Liberals that was keeping the minority government in power, in an attempt to untangle his party from the unpopular incumbents. In return, he weathered attacks from both the Conservatives and Liberals and has been sagging in the polls ever since. Trudeau's resignation in January sent the NDP poll numbers tumbling even further. In December, Leger's voting intentions survey put the Liberals at 21 per cent support and the NDP at 19, with the Conservatives dominating with 43 per cent support. This marks a 12-point increase for the Liberals and an eight point decrease for the NDP over two months. ""They are benefiting from the fact that they are in power right now, and they are in charge of defending Canada against the tariff threats coming from the United States,"" Dallaire said. ""There's a Trump eclipse happening right now so it's much harder for opposition parties to be seen."" Poilievre tried to wrestle the spotlight back on the weekend with a large ""Canada First"" rally that rebuked Trump for his tariff threats, arguing that Canadians will ""bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country."" Along with Trump, the Liberal leadership race has also scrambled Canadian politics. According to the Postmedia-Leger poll, when asked about their voting intentions if leadership front-runner Mark Carney were to be leader of the Liberal party during an election instead of Trudeau, support for the Liberals grew by six points. ""If an election were held today, it's almost tied when you introduce Carney to the equation ... It's hypothetical. A lot of things need to happen for these numbers to materialize. The Liberals' voters don't really know Mark Carney right now,"" Dallaire said But with the Liberal leadership vote looming on March 9 and tariffs from United States dominating the headlines, Dallaire said Canada's political climate is shifting rapidly. ""Donald Trump has a lot more impact on voting intentions right now than whatever the parties are doing here ... I would be cautious about even trying to say where numbers will be in two weeks or three weeks because they might shift. It depends on what happens in the U.S.,"" said Dallaire.

Kingston's new democratic party candidate elliot goodell ugalde,2025,"K I N G S T O N After volunteering behind the scenes on several election campaigns, Elliot Goodell Ugalde put his name on the ballot for the first time late last month. The New Democratic Party candidate for Kingston and the Islands, Goodell Ugalde is tasked with repeating the party's historic win here in 2018. Born in Mexico, Goodell Ugalde and his family moved to Canada when he was four years old. After arriving, his family lived in Ontario and British Columbia, earning an undergraduate degree at the Uni- versity of Victoria and a master's degree at McMaster University. Goodell Ugalde is now a PhD candidate in political science at Queen's University specializing in international relations and political economy, with a focus on health-care policy. ""It's different being in the spotlight, but I understand the sort of crises that this constituency is facing in terms of food insecurity, in terms of housing, and I do feel that I am the best prepared to advocate for it at Queen's Park,"" he said. ""I've been privileged enough to do policy work in a number of different constituents or constituencies, including in Toronto and I've seen first-hand the dangers of privatizing our public services and green spaces, as we saw with the Ford administration'sprivatizationofthegreenbelt, and I am scared that Ford has established a precedent that has made its way to Kingston and the Islands."" Like many opponents of the current Progressive Conservative government, Goodell Ugalde said he doesn't accept Premier Doug Ford's decision to call a snap election in order to better position the government to address the tariff threat from the United States. Instead, he said, the voters' focus is on more tangible issues, such as the cost of living, housing and the shortage of family doctors. ""Kingston is disproportionate- ly affected by the cost of food and food insecurity. We know that the city declared a state of emergenCYs that one in three Kingstonians struggle to put food on the table."" ""I spoke with the executive director of the Food Sharing Project, which is an organization that feeds our school children, that their core provincial funding hasn't increased in 12 years, and that spans across two administrations, both the Liberals and the Conservatives, and that's quite shameful and that's part of the reason why I want to implement a universal food program for school children."" Goodell Ugalde said as a young person, and a student, he better understands many of the important issues facing the voters. ""Young people are disproportionately affected by the cost of living crisis. I'm coming at this as someone who will never own a home, who does not have a family doctor, is someone who, if I have an emergency, I will have to go to KGH and wait for 22 hours. That stunts my ability to continue going to work, which stunts my wage, which is again quite difficult when I'm struggling between paying my rent and putting food on the table.

"Why do competent New Democrats put up with Ontario's version?; NDP's plan for Toronto like weak, flat beer",2025,"The Ontario NDP unveiled a bespoke ""plan for Toronto"" this week, and it's not hard to see why. Poll analyst Philippe J. Fournier's seat model shows the party in serious danger of losing official party status once the votes are counted on Feb. 27. New Democrats need 12 seats to guarantee that status and all the benefits that come with it, including funding and standing in the legislature. At just 16 per cent support, per Leger's and Nanos's latest polls - that's down from 24 per cent in the 2022 election - Fournier has the NDP posting ""safe"" wins in just four ridings, three of them in Toronto, with five other ridings ""leaning"" toward an NDP victory, of which two more are in the city. With Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie now explicitly calling on New Democrats to vote red to slay the Demon Ford, NDP Leader Marit Stiles will want to lock down what she can. (For the record, Crombie's Liberals are also flirting with losing official-party status - for the third election in a row, no less.) As such, I expected the NDP's new plan for Toronto would make folks in places like Toronto-Danfor th, Spadina-Fort York, University-Rosedale and Stiles' own riding of Davenport happy. There would be a promise not to meddle with the city's bike lanes like the Ford government has, at the very least. Maybe there would be a new financial deal for Ontario's big cities, or maybe even support for much more democratically autonomous ""charter cities."" A 2021 Ekos poll found 89 per cent of NDP voters in Toronto, and 76 per cent provincewide, supported the idea. Giving more power to Toronto politicians is always a risk, I will concede. But Doug Ford's government isn't exactly knocking its To - ronto files out of the park. Its plan for Ontario Place is a bizarre $2.2-billion taxpayer giveaway to an Austrian waterpark-cum-spa developer; the PCs clearly shut down the Ontario Science Centre, decrepit though it may be, to move it to Ontario Place in hopes of making the waterpark-cum-spa development look less terrible; the Eglinton Crosstown line has no opening date attached to it, nor are we entitled to know why there is no opening date attached to it. Anyway, there's none of that in the NDP plan for Toronto. It's remarkably weak, flat beer. The press release announcing the plan mentions just one Toronto-specific item: A provincial NDP government would pay 50 per cent of the TTC's operating costs. That's significant. Toronto's appal - lingly dysfunctional transit system's net operating budget in 2025 is $1.4 billion. Dive into the 12-page plan itself and you'll find a few more Toronto-specific items. Cancelling the Ontario Place deal, and renovating and reopening the Science Centre in situ. Funding the Waterfront East LRT. Reviving the Mimico and Park Lawn GO train station projects - but not, strangely, to fund the recently forsaken Finch East and King-Liberty GO stations, the latter of which is in one of those ""NDP-leaning"" ridings of Spadina-Fort York. (It's also just a good idea.) And naturally, because no one may disagree on this issue in Ontario politics, the NDP will remove tolls from Highway 407. (I'm almost tempted to call it Trump-ian, but that would be churlish.) Bike lanes aren't mentioned. There are other things in the NDP plan to appeal to urbanites in general, of course. Rent control that includes ""vacancy control,"" meaning landlords can't raise rents between tenancies. Most economists will tell you it's a terrible idea, especially during a housing crisis: it makes it less attractive as a business proposition to build more rental units, which we desperately need. But good luck with that argument on the campaign trail. The plan to upload shelter costs to the province would certainly help municipal budgets. The proposal to fix the courts system is a smart, essential plank in any law-and-order platform ... though in the NDP's case it seems to be the only such plank. But it all seems like throwing so much stuff at a wall and hoping some of it sticks before it goes splat on the floor. Beating Ford in this election was always going to be a very tall order - though I don't think the Liberals and NDP helped themselves by insisting, over and over again, that we shouldn't be having an election at all. But if Stiles can't even hold on to official party status, never mind official opposition, surely a reckoning must be at hand. New Democrats govern now, or have governed this century, in British Columbia (albeit is a somewhat unique two-party system), Alberta, Saskatchewan (where they finished a strong second in last year's election), Mani - toba (Premier Wab Kinew, like him or not, is certainly a compelling figure by modern Canadian political standards) and Nova Scotia. They were one-offs, so far, in Alberta and Nova Scotia - protest votes, essentially, which is what threw Bob Rae's Ontario NDP into power in 1990. But in three Canadian provinces, the NDP have long known how to win friends influence people. It's the Ontarians, both at Queen's Park and in Ottawa, who seem to let the side down. They can't go on like this, surely. Unlike some provincial parties named Liberal and Conservative, the New Democrats are officially one party from sea to sea to sea. In practice it's clearly at least two parties: One that cares about winning, and sometimes-to-often does in certain provinces; and this sad-sack outfit in Upper Canada, who cannot possibly be doing the brand any good.

"Ford government’s school funding vow doesn’t do enough to meet Ontario’s needs, opposition parties say:   The Ontario NDP and Liberal parties say the Ford government has failed to adequately fund education, leaving too many students to learn in portables and too many schools in need of repair",2025,"With a provincial election in Ontario less than a week away, the Ford government’s promise to spend more than $1-billion to build new schools is not nearly enough to meet the needs across the province, opposition parties say. Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative Party has not yet released any election platform details regarding its plans for education. But just before calling the election last month, Mr. Ford’s government promised $1.3-billion to build 30 new schools and expand 15 already existing schools across the province. Combined, the projects will create 25,000 new student spaces, the province said. The funding is part of the government’s commitment to spend $16-billion over the next 10 years to support new school construction, renewal and improvement projects. But the Ontario NDP and Liberal parties say the Ford government has failed to adequately fund education, leaving too many students to learn in portables and too many schools in need of repair. ""With a growing population we need new schools, but we also need the schools that our kids are in now to be safe, healthy environments, and unfortunately too many of them are not,"" says Chandra Pasma, the Ontario NDP’s education critic. NDP Leader Marit Stiles has promised to spend an additional $830-million per year to clear the school repair backlog within 10 years. That backlog is significant. A December report from Financial Accountability Office of Ontario estimated that it would cost $21.7-billion to clear the infrastructure backlog and maintain all school buildings in a state of good repair over the next decade. The report also said that it would cost $9.8-billion to build new schools to address permanent capacity pressures during that same period. The number of students in Ontario is growing – the report says more than 170,000 student spaces will need to be built by the 2033 school year to meet projected enrolment growth – and overcrowding is already a widespread issue: 35.2 per cent of schools in the English Catholic system and 29.7 per cent of schools in the English public system are currently over capacity. Of the 10 largest school boards in Ontario, the Durham District School Board has the highest proportion of overcapacity schools, with 69.2 per cent of schools operating above 100-per-cent utilization, followed by the Thames Valley District School Board, at 40.6 per cent, according to the report. As boards struggle with capacity issues, more than one-third of schools are in need of repairs, the report says. The problem is particularly severe at the Toronto District School Board, where 84.1 per cent of schools are in need of repairs. At the Thames Valley District School Board, 52.5 per cent of schools need repairs, the report says. Ontario Education Minister Jill Dunlop says the Ford government has prioritized building schools quickly. ""Under our plan, schools are being built faster and more efficiently than ever before so more students have access to a place to learn and prepare for the jobs of tomorrow,"" she said in a press release. But the Ontario Liberal Party says schools are not being built quickly enough to meet the needs of overcrowding. ""Every single kid in Ontario needs and deserves to learn in a safe, functioning school environment. This has not been the case in Doug Ford’s Ontario. After years of underinvestment by Ford’s Conservatives, almost one in 10 kids in Ontario are taking their classes in a portable,"" Taylor Deasley, a spokesperson for Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie, said in an e-mail. The FAO report found that there are nearly 1,500 schools across the province that are over capacity. The report estimates that to address capacity pressures, the province would need to build the equivalent of 227 new schools over the next decade. Kathleen Woodcock, president of the Ontario Public School Boards’ Association, says that while the government’s promise to build new schools is welcome news, any future provincial government needs to do more in order to help boards across the province address their infrastructure costs. In particular, she says, lifting the moratorium that has barred boards from closing or merging schools since 2017 would help relieve the significant financial pressures they are struggling with. ""It’s an unsustainable situation to have that moratorium because it has created funding deficits,"" Ms. Woodcock says. ""It costs the same to clean, maintain and keep the lights on in any school whether it’s half-full or full."" The Toronto District School Board, the largest school board in Canada, has also asked the province to lift the moratorium, which would save the TDSB ""millions of dollars,"" board chair Neethan Shan says. ""We have asked the provincial government to allow us to lift the moratorium, and they don’t have to do it provincially,"" he says. ""They can make it specific to the city of Toronto if they are worried about other parts of the province because there’s a lot of money that we lose by not consolidating projects."" The province has consistently said that families do not want schools to close. None of the five capital projects the TDSB submitted for consideration were approved for funding under the province’s $1.3-billion plan. Lifting the moratorium would allow the board to spend money more efficiently, Mr. Shan says. ""There are buildings that are underutilized and are being maintained at a cost of millions of dollars that could go towards programs.""

Singh setting his sights on Carney:   Polls show Liberal leadership hopeful could lead party to comeback - at expense of NDP,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is ramping up his attacks on Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney, painting him as a corporate-friendly politician who will slash public services just like Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. In a campaign-style speech to labour organizers in Edmonton on Thursday, Singh argued Carney's pledge this week to balance the federal operating budget and cap the growth of the public service would hurt Canadian workers and help the wealthy. ""Cutting services people count on and handing out more to the billionaires - that's not the Canada I want,"" Singh told the Canadian Labour Congress's political action conference. ""Instead, let's build a Canada that puts people first, that puts workers first."" Singh's attempt to frame Carney comes as the former central-banker is out-fundraising his rivals in the Liberal leadership campaign, with recent polls suggesting a Carney-led Liberal party could make a political comeback, in some cases at the expense of Singh's New Democrats, and as U.S. President Donald Trump's threats against Canada have forced political leaders to pivot their narratives. But so far, the NDP is suggesting Carney's popularity is a leadership race bump and his honeymoon with voters will wear off when it's time for Canadians to make a choice, should Liberals pick him as party leader. That's how Singh himself framed it this week when asked about the recent polls. ""I've asked Canadians this question, and I encourage folks to make this reflection themselves, 'is your life better or worse after nine years of Liberals being in power? Is it more expensive or less expensive to buy a home? How about grocery prices, have they gone up or gone down? On each of these points, Canadians' lives are worse after nine years of Liberals,"" Singh said on Tuesday, presenting the expected election as a choice between the Conservatives and NDP. That the departure of an unpopular incumbent and the arrival of a new leader leads to a temporary boost in the polls is not a novelty in Canadian political history, said Karl Bélanger, a former NDP national director. It happened to Kim Campbell, who replaced Brian Mulroney as prime minister and initially polled competitively before her Conservatives suffered a historic defeat four months later. NDP brass believe that Carney would quickly call a federal election should he be elected Liberal leader on March 9 - a prospect Carney himself has not ruled out, unlike his Liberal competitors running to replace Justin Trudeau. That doesn't leave much time for the party to attempt and define Carney to Canadians, said some New Democrats who spoke to the Star. This all comes as Trump's threat of tariffs and annexing Canada has upended Canadian politics. Luke Savage, who co-wrote a book with former NDP leader Ed Broadbent, said Carney is appealing to Canadians in the current moment because he appears socially conscious, calm, cool and technocratic. But he argued a trade war with the U.S. would require far more ambitious state intervention in the economy that the NDP needs to embrace. ""One of the jobs of the NDP is to expose what's going on there, and underscore that he's pretty traditional, middle of the road, and small-c conservative in some ways,"" Savage told the Star. ""That's not what we need in this moment."" Singh, like his political rivals, has embraced a more nationalist message amid Trump's threats, attempting to position himself as the best placed to stand up to the American president. ""The other guys are going to tell you that you're going to have to sacrifice, that there will be pain for workers and families as we fight back,"" he said on Thursday. ""But the burden of fighting Donald Trump should not fall on working people."" He has vowed to impose retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. and cut off the supply of critical minerals to the U.S. He's called for an east-west clean electricity network, built with Canadian products only. While he has attacked Poilievre and attempted to link him to Trump and Elon Musk, Carney appears to now be in his crosshairs. ""When given a choice between the CEOs or you and your family, I know that Pierre Poilievre is going to choose the CEOs, and I know that Mark Carney will do the same,"" he said to reporters following his speech on Thursday. ""We're always going to have your back."" The election could also have high stakes for Singh, who is now the longest-serving leader among Canada's three major parties. To Bélanger, Singh ""needs to show growth"" in the coming election, or risk his position as party leader.

Daudrich-led Tory party would be gift for NDP,2025,"Manitoba’s social conservatives are excited these days. With the rise of Trumpism south of the border and a looming federal election in Canada that could see the Conservative party win a majority government, there’s been plenty to electrify the spirits of social conservatives in Manitoba. Which is why Wally Daudrich, a Churchill lodge owner who recently joked about releasing polar bears into downtown Winnipeg to solve the city’s homelessness problem, may have a chance of winning the Progressive Conservative party’s leadership race in Manitoba. It will depend on how many party memberships Daudrich can sell and where the new sign-ups live. Unlike the last Tory leadership race in 2021, narrowly won by former premier Heather Stefanson, the party will not be using a pure one-member, one-vote system. Instead, party officials have chosen a points-based model that will limit how much each constituency can influence the vote. It’s designed to prevent any constituency from unduly influencing the outcome of a leadership race through mass membership sign-ups. The Tories were criticized in the last leadership race for what appeared to be a flurry of new sign-ups from people who bought memberships for the sole purpose of voting for leadership candidate Shelly Glover (who, among other things, actively courted the anti-vaccine vote during the COVID-19 pandemic). Glover garnered 49 per cent of the vote. The new system is expected to mitigate that possibility this time around. But it still allows new sign-ups to influence the vote to some degree. That’s good news for a candidate such as Daudrich, who probably doesn’t have the Tory establishment vote, but could sign up enough members from across the province to tip the balance in his favour. The candidate with the most points on April 26 wins the race. Daudrich, a pro-lifer who has made transphobic comments, is an attractive option for Trump-loving social conservatives in Manitoba. He has the backing of party stalwart Ken Lee, who played a role in the party’s toxic and racist election campaign in 2023, and is intent on “getting the woke out of schools,” which he claims is indoctrinating students. If you’re a social conservative in Manitoba, Wally is your guy. Of course, a Daudrich victory would be a disaster for the PCs. No party can form government in Manitoba without winning a sizable number of seats in Winnipeg which, for the most part, is made up of moderate, progressive voters. While the Tories normally poll well in most of rural Manitoba, they typically need to tie, or come close to tying the NDP in Winnipeg to win government. That would be virtually impossible for a party led by someone like Daudrich. The Tories were nearly wiped off the electoral map in Winnipeg in the last election. It was further evidence Trump-like campaign tactics don’t work in the capital city. But that doesn’t seem to matter to the social conservatives behind the Daudrich campaign, who are deluded into thinking they can convince enough voters in Winnipeg (and other, more progressive, parts of Manitoba) to elect a social conservative Tory government. They are so exhilarated with the success of the ultra-right in the U.S. (which is quickly turning into fascism) and with the possibility of a Conservative win at the federal level (although that seems very fluid at the moment), that they believe it could translate into victory for them in Manitoba. It wouldn’t. Not even close. It’s unclear how the Tories’ new points-based system will impact the outcome of the leadership race. It may be enough to prevent a takeover of the party by extremists. But if it isn’t, the party is in big trouble. Naturally, the prospect of a Daudrich victory is good news for the NDP, because it would ensure a long reign in office for the party. The fact the Tories’ leadership election committee even allowed Daudrich to run (after disqualifying Lee from running in 2021) is a sign that party brass are willing to flirt with the kind of social conservatism Daudrich is peddling. That should be very troubling to moderate conservatives. The more Daudrich speaks, the better it is for the NDP. If the polar bear tour company owner wins, it will be catastrophic for the PC party. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 21, 2025",Conservatism; Voters; Political parties,,2025-02-21,Winnipeg Free Press
Opposition parties critical of NDP's throne speech,2025,"With the NDP's throne speech Tuesday focused squarely on U.S. President Donald Trump and the threats he is posing to Canada's economy and sovereignty, B.C. Conservative leader John Rustad portrayed the provincial government's rhetoric as an effort to distract from its own shortcomings. ""(Premier David Eby) wants to be able to blame somebody for his failures,"" Rustad told reporters. ""When you look at the budget, look at what this government has done to this province - whether it is the 16,000 people that have died from overdoses, whether it is the failure to be able to really move any sort of resource projects, and whether it's the lack of confidence by people who invest in this province - (Eby) wants an enemy, and so he's doing everything he can to generate that enemy."" Despite this, the Opposition leader did acknowledge that many of the policies that were included in the throne speech draw inspiration from his own October election platform He specifically cited the NDP's references to the need to combat the spread of fentanyl across the province and take action to tighten border security. Rustad questioned whether some of the NDP's commitments are the right move, such as exempting wind power projects from environmental assessments, or whether others go as far as they need to, such as the public service hiring freeze. ""These are all promises that are out there. What will we actually be able to keep and do? (Eby) said he's going to freeze spending, he's freezing hiring, and yet he's talking about more spending initiatives. So which is it, in terms of what he's doing?"" he asked. ""I think if you really wanted to be able to get the economy going in this province, you actually need to keep government out of the way. There have been layers of bureaucracy and process that you've added on in British Columbia that have created nothing but delays and challenges for anybody to try to do anything in this province, and that is only continuing."" Green party interim leader Jeremy Valeriote took a different tact, saying he appreciates the NDP taking the tariff threat seriously. At the same time, he said it is one thing to say the right things, another to carry them out. ""It's easy to employ wartime analogies in face of a fresh, headline-grabbing crisis, but a government with a real vision for the future needs to be laser focused on delivering results to all the long-standing crises British Columbians are facing,"" said Valeriote. ""We are in this situation because we didn't look far enough ahead. So we need a plan that delivers long-term stability and security for British Columbians, and it must benefit people first rather than corporations."" He said he looks forward to working with the NDP on building non-market housing, developing community health centres, and expanding both mental health coverage and public transit through the Co-operation and Responsible Government Accord signed between the two parties in December.","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 20, 2025",,,2025-02-20,The Province
"NDP Sees 'deadly' slide in polls; Tory, Liberal support steadies",2025,"For the first time since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation last month, a new poll shows Canadian politics experiencing a rare phenomenon: stability. A Postmedia-Leger survey found the Conservatives leading with 41 per cent support, the Liberals in second with 33 per cent support and the NDP's support plunging to 11 per cent. The poll found NDP support falling three percentage points since last week, with a one-point rise in Conservative support and a two-point rise in Liberal support. ""If you're the Conservatives, it's good news because the shifting seems to be plateauing right now. If the election were held today it would be Trudeau against (Conservative Leader Pierre) Poilievre,"" said Sébastien Dallaire, Leger's executive vice-president of Eastern Canada. ""Right now, voting intentions have moved significantly in recent weeks, and this is the first poll where we see a little bit more stability,"" he said. While both the Liberals and the Conservatives could find good news in the survey, the NDP's decline marks a five percentage point decrease in support over the past two weeks.

""We have two contenders at this point and (NDP Leader) Jagmeet Singh hasn't been able to invite himself to the party,"" said Dallaire. In September, Singh ripped up his supply-and-confidence agreement with the Liberals that was keeping the minority government in power, in an attempt to untangle his party from the unpopular incumbents.

"More Doctors, Safer Highways NDP Priorities; Ontario Election",2025,"Note: The Sudbury Star has given candidates running in the Sudbury and Nickel Belt ridings the chance to submit a column about why they are running and their priorities if elected. FRANCE GELINAS My name is France Gelinas and I am running in the provincial election to represent the good people of Nickel Belt. I have been the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Nickel Belt since the 2007 election. I am a physiotherapist by profession, I worked in hospitals for over a decade. After doing a master's degree in business administration (MBA) at Laurentian University I started administrative work. I left the hospital sector for the community health sector. Before entering provincial politics, I was the executive director of the Community Health Centre in Sudbury. We focused on serving the francophone community in Greater Sudbury and surrounding communities. The values I learned in the community health movement have shaped my focus for my time as the MPP for Nickel Belt. Respect, integrity, collaboration and accountability are the values my team and I have used to serve constituents and represent them at Queen's Park. As the MPP for Nickel Belt, I have focused a lot on bringing equitable access to health care services to all the residents. There are currently 30,000 people in Sudbury and Nickel Belt that don't have access to a family doctor or nurse practitioner to handle their primary health care needs. This leads directly into the backlog at our hospital emergency room. Sick people that have no family physician end up waiting for hours at ""emerg"" because there is no other place for them to access health services. This is part of the Ford government's agenda; underfund the public health care services so badly that people will be willing to try anything. For the Ford government. that means private for-profit health care services. It doesn't have to be this way. There are health-care organizations across Nickel Belt that would love to take on more patients if the government funded them; but those funding applications aren't approved or even acknowledged. Nickel Belt is the seventh largest riding in Ontario. As the MPP, I drive to every corner of my riding. Complaints about winter road maintenance are top of mind for a lot of my constituents. We use these roads to shop, bring kids to school or simply head to work. Unfortunately, the private contractors tasked to clear these roads are sometimes happier to risk a fine as punishment rather than follow the contracts they signed. It's wrong to have a private company thinking about their profits before road users' safety. It's time to put safety first and make the province responsible for winter road maintenance where contractors fail. It has been over two years since the OPP investigation into untrained commercial vehicle drivers in this province but there is no evidence that anything has been done. My fellow NDP members and I have repeatedly asked the government at Queen's Park to make changes to driver training but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. We need a government that takes highway safety seriously and I hope to be a part of that government. The reason I'm running to be the MPP for Nickel Belt is simple: I enjoy helping people. Since I was first elected it has been my priority to listen to my constituents and try to help them, their family or their business. Whether it be an all-candidates debate, lunch at a seniors' club or at community events, I'm there, serving the people of Nickel Belt. It is an honour that I hope to continue to hold. Nickel Belt deserves a representative that puts residents and their needs first, makes life more affordable, protects our public health-care system, makes our roads safer and fix our schools. I hope you'll choose me. sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca MORE INFO France Gelinas has held Nickel Belt since 2007. Challenging her this election are Natalie Labbee (Liberal), Randy Hazlett (PC), James Chretien (Libertarians) and Paul DiVincenzo (New Blue Party).

NDP sees 'deadly' slide in polls as Conservative and Liberal support stabilizes,2025,"OTTAWA For the first time since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation last month, a new poll shows Canadian politics experiencing a rare phenomenon: stability. A Postmedia-Leger survey found the Conservatives leading with 41 per cent support, the Liberals in second with 33 per cent support and the NDP's support plunging to 11 per cent. The poll found NDP support falling three percentage points since last week, with a one-point rise in Conservative support and a two-point rise in Liberal support. ""If you're the Conservatives, it's good news because the shifting seems to be plateauing right now. If the election were held today it would be Trudeau against (Conservative Leader Pierre) Poilievre,"" said Sébastien Dallaire, Leger's executive vice-president of Eastern Canada. ""Right now, voting intentions have moved significantly in recent weeks, and this is the first poll where we see a little bit more stability,"" he said. While both the Liberals and the Conservatives could find good news in the survey, the NDP's decline marks a fiver percentage point decrease in support over the past two weeks. ""The slide for the NDP has continued,"" Dallaire said. ""The NDP has been on this deadly steady downward trajectory. It's as if voters now are looking into who's going to be in the best position to defend us against (U.S. President) Donald Trump. ""We have two contenders at this point and (NDP Leader) Jagmeet Singh hasn't been able to invite himself to the party,"" said Dallaire. In September, Singh ripped up his supply-and-confidence agreement with the Liberals that was keeping the minority government in power, in an attempt to untangle his party from the un- popular incumbents. In return, he weathered attacks from both the Conservatives and Liberals and has been sagging in the polls ever since. Trudeau's resignation in January sent the NDP poll numbers tumbling even further. In December, Leger's voting intentions survey put the Liberals at 21 per cent support and the NDP at 19, with the Conservatives dominating with 43 per cent support. This marks a 12-point increase for the Liberals and an eight point decrease for the NDP over two months. ""They are benefiting from the fact that they are in power right now, and they are in charge of defending Canada against the tariff threats coming from the United States,"" Dallaire said. ""There's a Trump eclipse happening right now so it's much harder for opposition parties to be seen."" Poilievre tried to wrestle the spotlight back on the weekend with a large ""Canada First"" rally that rebuked Trump for his tariff threats, arguing that Canadians will ""bear any burden and pay any price to protect the sovereignty and independence of our country."" Along with Trump, the Liberal leadership race has also scrambled Canadian politics. According to the Postmedia-Leger poll, when asked about their voting intentions if leadership front-runner Mark Carney were to be leader of the Liberal party during an election instead of Trudeau, support for the Liberals grew by six points. ""If an election were held today, it's almost tied when you introduce Carney to the equation... It's hypothetical. A lot of things need to happen for these numbers to materialize. The Liberals' voters don't really know Mark Carney right now,"" Dallaire said But with the Liberal leadership vote looming on March 9 and tariffs from United States dominating the headlines, Dallaire said Canada's political climate is shifting rapidly. ""Donald Trump has a lot more impact on voting intentions right now than whatever the parties are doing here... I would be cautious about even trying to say where numbers will be in two weeks or three weeks because they might shift. It depends on what happens in the U.S.,"" said Dallaire.","Telegraph-Journal; Saint John, N.B.","Saint John, N.B.","Borg, Jeremy",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 20, 2025",Conservatism; Leadership; Voters; Tariffs,,2025-02-20,Telegraph-Journal
B.C. NDP to require health workers to witness patients' doses of safer supply after leak of diversion memo,2025,"The B.C. government is making changes to its safer supply program that will require patients to take their doses of medications such as hydromorphone in the presence of a health care worker. New patients will immediately be required to have their doses witnessed, but there will be a transition period for those already in the program. The announcement Wednesday from Health Minister Josie Osborne and Public Safety Minister Garry Begg came on the heels of a leaked provincial briefing document that detailed how some pharmacies were offering patients incentives to use their services that allowed the pharmacy to collect dispensing fees. The briefing also described the extent that prescribed opioids were being diverted. Along with the changes, Osborne and Begg reiterated that an investigation launched last year into pharmacies alleged to have participated is ongoing. ""Prescribed alternatives were introduced in B.C. as an emergency response during the pandemic, and since then, we've heard from people who've had their lives saved and stabilized, and they've gone on to enter treatment and recovery because of this health care,"" Osborne said. ""At the same time, we've heard concerns about these medications being diverted and ending up in the wrong hands. While the diversion of pain medication isn't new, there is a robust market in very realistic-looking but counterfeit medication that is laced with toxic drugs."" The acknowledgment of diversion of safer supply is a notable shift from the government's previous position that there was no evidence the practice was widespread. In March, then-public safety minister Mike Farnworth said the allegations were ""simply not true."" Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in July that more research was needed to assess the extent of safer supply diversion. She has long pushed for an expansion to the safer supply program, which serves over 4,000 of about 115,000 British Columbians with a substance use disorder. Osborne said she had not consulted with Henry, and Henry's office did not respond to a request for comment. As for the shift in positioning, the health minister said it is part of ""the need to care for and to literally save lives by using prescribed alternatives that prevent people who are at the highest risk of drug overdose from having to use illicit street drugs, and ensuring that these drugs are not being diverted and that they are not going into the wrong hands."" The announcement comes two weeks after the memo prepared by the Ministry of Health's investigative unit for RCMP officers was leaked to the opposition Conservatives. Ministry officials revealed the amount of hydromorphone being prescribed to drug users increased by 20 per cent between 2022 and the end of 2024 and that much of the drug wound up being trafficked in B.C., Canada and internationally. Roughly 60 pharmacies were accused in the report of offering incentives to doctors, patients and housing providers in exchange for having them use their services and maximize their dispensing fees of $11,000 per patient. It estimates that 22.4 million doses of opioids such as hydromorphone and oxycodone were prescribed to 5,000 patients between 2022 and 2024. Osborne said the prescription of hydromorphone has dropped by 34 per cent over the last year as addiction treatment shifts from the powerful opioid. ""Hydromorphone is probably the biggest subject of discussion today when it comes to diversion of prescribed alternatives and so it's encouraging to see that prescription patterns are changing,"" she said. Begg also said the province is working hard to combat drug trafficking and revealed that police across the province have seized 15,000 kilograms of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals since 2020 as well as 1,800 firearms. He pointed to the creation of the integrated gang homicide team and the expansion of the civil forfeiture program as examples of how the government is continuing to strengthen its efforts Conservative MLA Elenore Sturko, who has long called for an end to unwitnessed safer supply and brought up repeated anecdotes of diversion, said Wednesday's announcement is long overdue and, while she's pleased with the changes, she wished they had come two years ago. ""It made me emotional, because it made me think of the very first time that a parent had called me and their child had died of a fentanyl overdose, and they found these safe supply hydromorphones in their room, and they had started their path to addiction from diverted safe supply,"" she told reporters. ""I asked my first question in February 2023, so two years later, and you have to imagine that there have been millions of opioid pills diverted into our province. I am grateful to see that this action has been taken today, but I am disappointed to see that it took this long."" Sturko said the next step she wants to see from the NDP is a formal public inquiry into the program in order to find out exactly when the province was made aware that diversion was happening and how exactly these drugs were getting into the hands of drug traffickers. Green Interim Leader Jeremy Valeriote said he recognizes the concerns around diversion but wants to see hard evidence before supporting the changes. He is also concerned about potential unintended consequences of the move to end unwitnessed safe supply. ""There is a troubling lack of clarity around the consultation process. Key health experts, such as the Provincial Health Officer, were not engaged in these discussions. Credible public health policy must be based on reliable evidence and informed by health experts,"" said Valeriote. ""We have yet to see a report demonstrating widespread diversion. Without transparency on this, how can we justify such a restrictive policy?"" Some advocates, such as Guy Felicella, a peer clinical adviser with the B.C. Centre on Substance Use, are on board with the potential need to tweak the safer supply program but warn the issue of diversion is not as widespread as some say. He reiterated that the real issue is the toxic drug supply that continues to kill British Columbians, regardless of whether or not they have a substance use disorder, and that organized crime will likely adapt and find ways around the new restrictions. ""I could buy the same amount of pills on the street 20 years ago as I could today,"" said Felicella. ""Even that leaked document, which also showed all the prescriptions for all prescription drugs that were being diverted, looking at the hydromorphone, it was only 18 per cent so that means there's a lot more coming from other avenues."" Former chief coroner Lisa Lapointe, long a proponent of safer supply, opposed the government's end to unwitnessed consumption, saying it risks increasing barriers for the already small number of people who use the program and potentially forcing them back to street drugs. She also pointed to the declining number of deaths in recent months as an acknowledgement that some of the government's harm reduction measures are working and now is not the time to be dismantling efforts such as decriminalization or safer supply. ""Oftentimes, people who are struggling with substance use disorder, their lives are not always on a schedule, and they can't always get to a certain place at a certain time, because they may be looking for food or shelter and all of the other things very vulnerable folks in our communities have to struggle with every day,"" said Lapointe. ""What it will mean is less people accessing the prescribed program, which we already know is only accessible to a very small percentage of substance users in our province. It will mean more harm. It will likely mean more deaths."" Related B.C.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr.'s superstar potential is off the charts but he was apparently not worth a $450-million long-term contract. I have always maintained that Guerrero grew tired of the Jays' management incompetence and he will now seek to sign with a winning club. Look to Bo Bichette to follow his dear friend out the door. Personally, I have had enough and until such time as the Jays find solid baseball executives to replace the dynamic duo, I am done attending games. David Maki, Toronto Players' salaries are ridiculous I have to admit that I am disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement to keep the popular Vladimir Guerrero Jr. However, it never ceases to amaze me the ridiculous amount of money that we pay our professional sports figures. In real life you get paid for what you do on a day-to-day basis. Bonuses come at the end of the year after your performance has been measured. Not so in professional sports. They get paid for what we hope they will do in the future. So, these players make ridiculous amounts of money that is guaranteed for the duration of the contract regardless of how they perform during that contract. If a player has several poor years, like George Springer has demonstrated, do we get back some of the money that was given to him? I wish Vladdy well. I think that we have to give the Jay organization some credit here. There has to be some form of sanity regarding salary negotiations. Steve Glover, Aurora Great reporting on plane crash 'Everyone's Upside Down,' Feb. 18 I would like to congratulate Mark Colley for his outstanding report on the crash of the Delta Air Lines flight. Like many other Torontonians, I was glued to the TV for updates on the incident. None of the reports I saw captured the feelings of someone who got caught in a life-threatening situation as vividly, e.g. noting the interviewee said he didn't sit down because other people who sat down started crying, or that he said he was bouncing on his toes. How does one convey the stress and adrenalin rush unless one includes what others may dismiss as minor details? It made me feel I was going through the ordeal together with Nick Cottigan. Well done! Gloria Fung, Unionville Two different approaches but the same goal A Trump peace deal on Ukraine would signal his plans for the rest of us, Feb. 16 Andrew Phillips observes that Donald Trump's aspirations for Canada parallel Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions for Ukraine. Both depend on the claim that great powers are entitled to exercise dominion within their traditional spheres of influence. Putin has been using armed force to try to seize Ukraine. His overall goal, thus far unsuccessful, has been to recreate Greater Russia by swallowing up Russia's westerly neighbour, whose sovereignty he repudiates. Trump has proclaimed an interest in using economic force to compel Canada to become the 51st state. His overall goal, which parallels Putin's, has been to remake American greatness. Apparently, this now includes swallowing up America's northern neighbour. Both cases speak not so much to spheres of influence as to spheres of imperial expansion. The difference between Putin's approach and Trump's approach is that economic force doesn't require bloodshed. That aside, Trump's approach is simply the craftier way for a bully to try - against historical precedent - to absorb a neighbour's land and people with what he hopes will be a minimum of effort. We must stand in his way. Jeff Rose, Toronto Time to ask the U.K. for help Where's our King amid Trump's '51st state' threats? Charles stays frustratingly silent as Canada gets bullied, Feb. 16 Rosie DiManno is spot on in writing that it's time for King Charles to let U.S. President Donald Trump know that he is ""not amused"" by Trump's constant threats and insults to Canada. Of course, Charles cannot speak publicly about this but as DiManno says, but the Royals have always found ways to opine. However, a more effective and direct way to message Trump would be for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to ask U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to have a word with Trump. It's reported that Starmer is one of the few people who Trump respects. It's rare that one country asks another for diplomatic help when dealing with a third one, but it's warranted in this case. Starmer is skilled diplomatically and is the appropriate head of state to remind Trump that Canada is ""spoken for"" and that his constant denigration of Canada is not appreciated in the Commonwealth. Bruce Robb, Toronto Freeland can lead the way Chrystia Freeland anticipated the troubled times we're living in years ago, Feb. 19 David Olive brought out Chrystia Freeland's brilliant anticipation of the world's advanced economics. His article showing her awareness over the years of the direction the world's economics were heading really points out her full understanding of the issue. Too bad she was ignored.

Chris Andrews, Vaughan We must change how we govern It's time for the Ontario Liberals and NDP to get over themselves and stop fighting for second place, Feb. 17 As a lifelong NDPer, I totally agree with the NDP and Liberals joining of forces. In Niagara Centre, the Liberal candidate is a former Brock student now living in Hamilton - a vote drainer and splitter. I liked policies of both the NDP and the Liberals in the debate. The truth is that it is not popularity that counts, but final seat count. Ontario must change direction, change the way we govern.

NDP Leader Singh says pipelines not a priority,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he sees an east-west clean electricity network as his first priority for expanding the Canadian energy market - not new pipelines. While Singh isn't shutting the door entirely to pipelines, he says pipeline projects must be accepted by the communities through which they're routed, must not hurt the environment, must provide good jobs and must meet Indigenous consultation requirements. ""We're open to projects if they meet those criteria. The project I'm really excited about is an eastwest energy grid, but we're open to other projects as well,"" Singh said. Most Canadian energy exports now go to the United States, which is threatening Canada with a barrage of tariffs on all exports, including a 10 per cent levy on energy products such as oil. Singh first talked about building an east-west clean electricity grid during the 2019 election campaign. Flanked by steelworkers in Hamilton, Ont., he said building the project would be good for the workers exposed to the threat of American tariffs. ""Imagine the climate we could create, the business climate, the manufacturing climate ... if we connected the cheap, low-cost, clean electricity from jurisdictions like Manitoba, like B.C. and Quebec, and connected that across the country,"" Singh said. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to impose 25 per cent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum on March 12. Singh said an NDP government would commit to using only Canadian steel and aluminum in public infrastructure products. Singh added that an NDP government would make changes to employment insurance and ex- pand the work-sharing program. This program allows an employer to temporarily reduce hours for workers, instead of cutting their jobs entirely, while EI tops up their diminished pay. Singh said he would increase the EI benefit for people on the work-sharing program, expand the number of people eligible and remove the waiting period for benefits. Several other politicians vying to be prime minister are also sharing how they would expand Canada's energy market if elected. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has said he would support the construction of an east-west pipeline and would make it easier to approve resource projects. Liberal leadership candidate Chrystia Freeland has said she would make Canada an ""energy superpower"" by expanding hydro power and the export of liquefied natural gas. Former MP Frank Baylis, who is also pursuing the Liberal leadership, said he would establish two pipeline corridors to transport liquefied natural gas to Asian and European markets.

Clock ticking for Singh to seize the moment; Rethink urged on poilievre as biggest threat,2025,"After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be pre- pared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Quebecois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - en - suring the Liberals' survival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pact with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change. ""When you're defining your op - ponent, it is vitally important for it to be a critique that has an impact on the voter themselves,"" he says. ""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth."" Singh has been calling for Parliament to be recalled to pass a support package for workers and other Canadians who could be hurt by Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity. But with the possibility of an election call before that, Singh may have lost his chance.

Riding had poor turnout in 2022's provincial vote; Ontario Election NDP hopes to hang onto Windsor West with withdrawal of Liberal candidate,2025,"Here's what you need to know about Windsor West for the Feb. 27 Ontario election (advance voting Feb. 20-22): Windsor West has a population of more than 130,000 and covers 83 square kilometres, according to Elections Ontario, which uses 2021 census data. The riding is bound to the south by the city's border with LaSalle and Tecumseh and to the north and west by the Detroit River. To the east, Windsor West is generally bound by Langlois Avenue but juts out to Pillette Road between Tecumseh Road East and the airport. It encompasses both Windsor hospitals, the Ambassador Bridge, and most of what should become Ojibway National Urban Park. The riding was created in 1996 when the Mike Harris PC government changed provincial riding boundaries to match federal ones. The new Windsor West included parts of former Windsor-Sandwich and Windsor-Walkerville ridings. The NDP has held the riding since Lisa Gretzky's election in 2014. Before her, Windsor West was Liberal red for 15 years, with Sandra Pupatello (1999-2011) and Teresa Piruzza (2011-2014). In the 2022 provincial election, 32,039 of 95,295 registered voters (33.6 per cent) cast ballots, one of the worst turnouts across Ontario. Gretzky won with 42 per cent of the vote, followed by PC candidate John Leontowicz (35 per cent) and Liberal Linda McCurdy (13 per cent). Here are the 2025 candidates. Matthew Giancola (Ontario Party) is on the ballot but entered the race too late to be included here; the Liberals briefly had a candidate who subsequently withdrew. MARK DEWDNEY, NONE OF THE ABOVE DIRECT DEMOCRACY PARTY Age: 51 ""A big part of why I'm running is because party politicians don't know what to think - they're mouthpieces for their top donors."" Also running to send the message that people are ""tired of government making things more expensive and giving us less every year for it."" Top priorities: Diversifying Windsor's economy by attracting medical research and education; reducing red tape and government bureaucracy with automation; amplifying community paramedicine; and ""being able to give the disenfranchised a true voice."" TONY FRANCIS, PROGRESSIVE CON SERVATIVE PARTY OF ONTARIO Age: 61 Running to ""continue to build on the progress"" the Doug Ford PCs have ""achieved to grow our economy, create new jobs, protect livelihoods and keep (us) competitive, not just a week, or a month but for years to come."" Top priorities: Building Ontario's economy with infrastructure investments; protecting workers in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats ""by doing whatever is necessary to protect people's livelihoods in our community,"" including ""investing tens of billions of dollars to keep people working;"" fighting the federal carbon tax and urging Ottawa to cut red tape; banning drug consumption sites near schools and daycares and clearing encampments from public parks; and building a new LISA GRET ZKY, ONTARIO NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY Age: 54 ""I am proud to represent Windsor West both here at home and at Queen's Park. I have been a fighter for this community by speaking truth to power and bringing important pieces of legislation forward that have directly impacted this region,"" including introducing anti-scab labour legislation, the Intimate Partner Violence Epidemic Act, the More Than a Visitor Act for seniors in long-term care; banning iGaming ads, Noah and Gregory's law, Homelessness Task Force Act, and a motion to help create the Ojibway National Urban Park. Top priorities: ""As the member of provincial Parliament for the last decade, I am hearing more about the cost of living, lack of affordable housing, our decimated public healthcare system, lack of access to family doctors and crumbling school conditions for our kids. We need investments in mental health and addictions supports. The record number of food bank users including seniors and children living in poverty, especially in Windsor, is alarming and a clear failure of government."" JOSHUA GRIFFIN, NEW BLUE PARTY Age: 44 ""I am running because I believe the current fiscal situation in Ontario is dire. The current government's spending and healthcare policies, and cuts to education programs are unacceptable. The Ontario Conservatives have not provided the change they promised, and the NDP's track record on fiscal responsibility is concerning. The rising cost of living, increased use of food banks, and growth of tent cities demonstrate the urgent need for change. Addition- ally, the high salaries of hospital CEOs amidst a shortage of front line healthcare staff are deeply troubling."" Top priorities: Fight for increased staffing and bed space at local hospitals; implement a ""fair, across-the-board tax cut;"" ensure proper educational assistant staffing at area schools; attract more mental health professionals to Windsor West through a targeted ad campaign; and advocate for a stand-alone medical school in Windsor and encourage people to enter family and emergency medicine with a loan forgiveness program. NICK KOLASKY, GREEN PARTY OF ONTARIO Kolasky could not be reached for comment but did send the Star a news release about his candidacy in which he states that, after a successful career in manufacturing, he chose to relocate to Windsor and has pursued his passion for photography and protecting the environment.

Coping with tariffs starts with defending every job; Sussanne skidmore and hermender singh kailley,2025,"Donald Trump's looming 25 per cent tariff is a huge danger to our economy - and no longer hypothetical, with new tariffs on aluminum and steel exports. The impact of across-theboard tariffs would be devastating, with 124,000 B.C. workers potentially losing their jobs in the next four years, and many more caught up in the ripple effects. Defending our workers and our economy requires immediate action. But our vulnerability to the whims of one man signals the need for deeper, more far-reaching change. In the immediate term, we're telling our governments their first priority must be to defend jobs. Working people are the backbone of our economy, driving all the wealth our province creates. Good incomes allow them to raise their families, shop in their communities, support local businesses and build a better future for themselves and all of B.C. Any measures the government takes to support business, then, must be tied to preserving jobs. Job protection is the most important measure of success. Income support like employment insurance will unfortunately be necessary, but our best and first line of defence is avoiding job loss in the first place. We can take action as governments, businesses and organizations, as well as individuals, by buying B.C.-made and Canadian-made products, especially the unionmade products that sustain stable, quality jobs. Further, the province's decision to fast-track key projects offers a welcome assist to industries and workers that are among those most likely to be hardest hit. But as urgent as they are, these are also short-term, defensive solutions. They can't fully address our dependence on a single trading partner - especially when that partner has proven to be not only unreliable, but downright malicious and coercive. Tackling that vulnerability will require us to take bold, concerted action. The opportunity is now here to do just that. If Trump was hoping his barrage of threats and ""51st state"" rhetoric would divide Canada or intimidate us into compliance, it has backfired. He has inadvertently forged a remarkable public consensus and unity right now across the country. Trump, on the other hand, can count on no such consensus in his own country. Our conversations with U.S. unions consistently show American workers are as outraged as we are at Trump's assault on the economy and autonomy of an ally and friend. This offers us a chance to refocus our economy. ""Value-added"" and ""diversification"" have been mantras here for decades. But while we've had some success, a huge portion of our economy and a very large number of B.C. communities still rely on sending raw materials south of the border and elsewhere for processing - and then, very often, buying them back as processed goods. Now's the time for us to shift those efforts at diversification and value-added production into high gear and patriate much more of the processing and manufacturing we have left to others, especially the U.S. B.C. workers can and should be doing that work. That's a strategy we can pursue in tandem with other measures aimed at diversifying not just what we produce but who we sell it to: opening new global markets, expanding our relationships with existing partners and making it much easier for Canada's provinces and territories to trade with each other. And we can do that without deregulating in a race to the bottom; our aim should be strong labour standards and good, secure jobs. We also need to recognize how fundamentally the ground has shifted. For decades, we've relied on international treaties and enforcement regimes to stabilize trade. But it's time we recognized that treaties alone can't protect us from authoritarians and bullies. We must forge more and stronger partnerships with democratic forces throughout the world and strengthen the resilience of the civil institutions - and labour unions rank high among them - that can blunt the power of would-be strongmen. And make no mistake: The same authoritarian nationalist forces that brought Trump to power have made dangerous inroads in many other countries - including here in Canada, where a disturbing number of politicians have echoed Trump's rhetoric and even advocated compliance with his demands. We need to be wary of this rhetoric in our own backyard and refuse to let political ambition seed hate and division. We are better than that as a country. Whether Trump decides on March 4 to proceed with his tariffs or not, it should be clear that our relationship has been ruptured, possibly for a very long time. Diversifying trade, strengthening our economy, bolstering democracy here and abroad and, most urgently, supporting the workers our country relies on are now not only economic imperatives, but essential to our sovereignty. The time to act is now. B.C. workers, families and communities are depending on it. Sussanne Skidmore and Hermender Singh Kailley are respectively the president and secretary-treasurer of the B.C. Federation of Labour.","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 19, 2025",Rhetoric; Labor unions; Sovereignty; Tariffs,,2025-02-19,The Vancouver Sun
Clock ticking for Singh to seize the moment; Rethink urged on poilievre as biggest threat,2025,"After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be pre- pared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Quebecois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - en - suring the Liberals' survival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pact with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change.

""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth.""

At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity.

Throne speech sees NDP flex muscle with little to offer on glaring problems,2025,"The New Democrats delivered a throne speech that was heavy on the rhetorical side Tuesday with much talk about rising to the challenge that British Columbians did not ask for but will not shirk. ""Throughout history, British Columbians have risen to meet the moment,"" read a passage that invoked the wartime spirit of Winston Churchill. ""When Britain stood alone in Europe against the Nazis, Churchill made a desperate appeal for more military equipment. British Columbia answered the call."" All said in the name of committing the NDP government to a pivot to end all pivots. ""Your government is working quickly to reorient itself to a fundamentally changed landscape,"" read the speech. ""Difficult times, such as this, call for action that is both thoughtful and tough."" The words were tough to be sure. But the 18-page text broke little new ground on housing, public safety and the toxic drug crisis. Worse, it went back over old ground that the government had supposedly dealt with years ago. ""Your government will work with regulatory colleges to ensure health-care workers from other countries have their credentials recognized faster."" I have attended at least one news conference in the past two years where Premier David Eby and then-health minister Adrian Dix said they were already expediting approval of foreign credentials. Why isn't it done already? B.C. is ""taking steps to secure care for people struggling with brain injuries, mental illness and severe addictions."" The New Democrats have twice vowed to take those steps, twice reversed direction and now claim they'll do it after all. No word on when, or how or at what cost. The throne speech promises ""legislation to protect British Columbians from unfair practices by cellphone companies."" The John Horgan NDP government took action ""to improve cellphone contract and billing transparency"" six years ago. Maybe Eby wasn't paying attention. ""New legislation will be introduced to get roads, highways, public transit and other infrastructure projects built faster to keep our economy moving."" They must be hoping nobody brings up the over-budget, behind-schedule replacement for the Pattullo Bridge. Or the replacement for the Massey tunnel, which would be built by now had not the New Democrats sent the project back to Square 1, where it languishes in environment review. The New Democrats will take action to rescue ""our hard-hit forest sector."" Hard hit, one has to say, by government policies and regulations, and by the NDP's inadequate response to repeated cries for help. The throne speech promises to ""add value to every tree harvested."" That's an idea that has been around almost as long as some of the provincial stands of old growth. And hey, how about ""breaking down trade barriers between provinces?"" That one has been around almost as long as there have been provinces. A substantial part of the throne speech was dedicated to the government's drive to expedite development of a dozen and a half major projects - wind farms, pipelines, mines and the like. They are supposed to deliver $20 billion worth of investment, 8,000 jobs and, in the long run, make B.C. less dependent on the U.S. market. Given the vague generalities of throne-speech-ese, it is hard to say much about how that will be accomplished. ""Your government will eliminate unnecessary red tape and break down barriers to growth,"" says the speech. The New Democrats have been in government for going on eight years. Yet just now they are turning their attention to the red tape and barriers they created and maintained as obstacles to growth? The speech also pledges ""we will protect our land, air and water and we will take action to tackle climate change"" while ""continuing to ensure our high standards are met"" and partnering with ""Indigenous nations."" That sounds like quite a balancing act, all in all. In one of the few details on that score, the speech says legislation will be introduced to allow the B.C. Energy Regulator to act as the ""one window for permits to support the North Coast Transmission Line."" A mere three years ago, the New Democrats established the Ministry of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship as a ""one window"" agency for approval of resource projects. Why didn't that work out? Why does the province now need another window? We're told ""every minister has been given marching orders to speed up permit approvals to get job-creating projects built."" ""Every minister"" - the reference underscores the problem of overlapping jurisdictions. The permit application is submitted through the ""one win- dow,"" as intended. It still has to make the rounds through all the ministries, agencies and officials with jurisdiction over the environment, Indigenous relations, resources, land, finances and the economy. As for the premier's vow to ""supercharge"" project approvals, believe it when you see it. Since the New Democrats introduced Churchill into the discussion, I'm reminded that the wartime prime minister was known for emphasizing his directives to staff with red stickers demanding ""action this day."" Eby may wish to have some of those printed up if he intends to translate the throne speech's call to action into actual, prompt and decisive action. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 19, 2025",Legislation; Climate change; Roads & highways,,2025-02-19,The Vancouver Sun

The throne speech also teased legislation in the coming months to ""protect British Columbians from credit-card fraud, unfair practices by cellphone companies, and to recover health-care costs from wrongdoers."" Other bills mentioned include changes to make the B.C. Energy Regulator ""one window"" for permits for the North Coast Transmission Line between Prince George and Terrace, and speed up the development of other infrastructure projects such as roads and highways. Eby said these bills to free up the permitting process for the power line and improve infrastructure development are part of the goal to reduce barriers to trade between provinces and improve the Canadian economy. He pointed out that while resource projects are vital in achieving this, a lot of the work will be around regulations that limit people from engaging in professions such as construction, health care or law anywhere in the country. In rhetoric stronger than anything said so far by Eby or his government, the throne speech made comparisons between the effort needed to respond to U.S. threats and the storming of beachesin Normandy during the Second World War. ""While the recent threats from the U.S. administration have felt like a betrayal, they have awoken something powerful in Canadians,"" the speech read. ""You can see it everywhere you go.

NDP focus on American threat in first post-election throne speech,2025,"The B.C. legislature resumed Tuesday with the traditional speech from the throne, but one this year that was geared towards tackling one problem only: tariffs. In one of her first official acts as lieutenant governor, Wendy Cocchia read out the NDP-written speech and its plans to tackle U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on Canadian exports to its southern neighbour. The speech began with the now familiar refrain being voiced across the country that Canada ""will never be the 51st state"" despite Trump's repeated suggestions Canada should join the United States for its own economic and military protection. ""We open this first session of British Columbia's 43rd Parliament at the most consequential time for our province since the Second World War,"" it said. ""In the face of an unprecedented and unjustified threat to our economy, British Columbians are joining with all Canadians to fight back."" The statements come as the government prepares to release its 2025 budget on March 4. Last week, Finance Minister Brenda Bailey announced the NDP's signature promise of a $1,000 grocery rebate has been scrapped due to the possibility of an ""economic war"" with the U.S. Here are the takeaways from Tuesday's speech: Economy, economy, economy The bulk of the throne speech focused on actions intended to safeguard B.C.'s economy against the aggressiveness of the new administration in Washington D.C. With promises to accelerate permitting for natural resource projects, including major developments in the critical mineral, clean energy and natural gas sectors, expand relationships with other trading partners and break down interprovincial trade barriers, the NDP is putting new emphasis on old commitments. ""A new coalition of leaders in business, labour unions and First Nations are partnering with government,"" Cocchia read. ""Together, we are executing a made-in-B.C. plan: To speed up permitting and regulatory approvals, to train the next generation of skilled tradespeople; to attract private capital, while expanding our electricity production; To support emerging industries, from technology to life sciences; and to increase manufacturing opportunities."" Premier David Eby acknowledged to reporters that the focus of the speech, and indeed of the spring session, was completely changed by Trump's election and his position towards Canada. ""We were and have been preparing for lower interest rates, easing pressure on British Columbians, assisting businesses in reinvesting, expansion of our economy, continuing that work,"" said Eby. ""Clearly, this is a different environment. We're now facing a scenario where there are tariffs threatened that will put Canada's and British Columbia's economy on the back foot, and we need to make sure that we're meeting the moment."" Conservative Leader John Rustad accused Eby of simply looking for an enemy amid his government's failure to address any of the issues facing the province. He specifically pointed to the toxic drug crisis and the long wait times for resource projects to get development approval. ""He wants to be able to blame somebody for his failure,"" Rustad told reporters. ""When you look at the budget, look at what this government has done to this province, whether it is the 16,000 people that have died from overdoses, whether it is the failure to be able to really move any sort of resource projects, and whether it's the lack of confidence by people who invest in this province, he wants an enemy, and so he's doing everything he can to generate that enemy."" Green Interim Leader Jeremy Valeriote, meanwhile, credited the government for recognizing some of the main issues facing British Columbians. He said those words now need to be backed up by action. ""It's easy to employ wartime analogies in face of a fresh, headline-grabbing crisis, but a government with a real vision for the future needs to be laser focused on delivering results to all the longstanding crises British Columbians are facing,"" said Valeriote. Strengthening health care and delivering on ""kitchen-table issues"" There wasn't much in the way of new commitments in Tuesday's speech with the NDP taking a ""stay the course"" approach to governing during economic uncertainty. Campaign promises remain to build 300,000 more homes over 10 years, fast-track the credentials process for internationally-trained health-care workers and expand the use of involuntary care for people with severe addictions. The throne speech also teased legislation in the coming months to ""protect British Columbians from credit-card fraud, unfair practices by cellphone companies, and to recover health-care costs from wrongdoers."" Other bills mentioned include changes to make the B.C. Energy Regulator a ""one window"" for permits for the North Coast Transmission Line between Prince George and Terrace and speed-up the development of other infrastructure projects like roads and highways. Eby said these bills to free-up the permitting process for the power line and improve infrastructure development are part of the goal to reduce barriers to trade between provinces and improve the Canadian economy. He pointed out that while resource projects are important in achieving this, a lot of the work will be around regulations that prevent people from engaging in professions like construction, health care or law anywhere in the country. ""There's work to be done around products like alcohol and and other controlled products that the provinces have significant oversight in relation to,"" he said. ""But I think the low hanging fruit is really in relation to services. When you're an engineer, when you're a lawyer, when you're a doctor, when you provide services of one kind or another and you're certified and you're safe to provide those services in one province, you should be certified and safe to provide those services across Canada."" ""True north strong and free"" In rhetoric stronger than anything said so far by Eby or his government, the throne speech made comparisons between the effort needed to respond American threats and the storming of the beaches in Normandy during the Second World War. ""While the recent threats from the U.S. administration have felt like a betrayal, they have awoken something powerful in Canadians,"" the speech read. ""You can see it everywhere you go. People are considering their choices carefully. When planning the next vacation, they're choosing to travel locally. At the grocery store, they're looking for a 'made in Canada' or 'BuyBC' logo. We are all saying with one unified voice: our country is not for sale."" It pointed out the long relationship between Canada and the U.S., which includes numerous relationships between families on both sides of the largest undefended border in the world. At the same time, the speech touted the strong Canadian social safety net as a key difference and said this country also has more robust democratic institutions. ""As proud British Columbians and Canadians, we are called on to meet this moment. The same way we always do: by working together and looking out for each other,"" the conclusion of the speech said. ""Together, we will build a stronger, more secure future. Here in the best province in the greatest country in the world. The true north, strong and free."" Asked about the symbolism of the speech, Eby simply said that many of the moments in history when British Columbians and Canadians came together in a united front were in response to wars. He said that what Trump is threatening is a form of warfare. ""Regardless of whether your house is bombed or whether you're foreclosed from it because you're fired, it makes very little difference to a family and and this feels to British Columbians and Canadians, and I think rightly so, like an unprovoked attack."" New speaker, same as the old speaker In the only other notable event at the legislature on Tuesday, Raj Chouhan, NDP MLA for Burnaby-New Westminster, was officially acclaimed as Speaker after having been announced in November as the NDP's nominee. Fellow NDP MLA Mable Elmore was named deputy speaker, while Conservative MLA Lorne Doerkson was appointed assistant deputy speaker. Eby had been trying to lure a Conservative or a Green to serve as Speaker in an attempt to give his party a more than one-seat majority but was unable to do so. ""It's a profound honour for me to get re-elected in the role of Speaker. Our province, everybody knows, is the best place on earth to live and work,"" Chouhan told the assembled members of the legislature after getting ""dragged"" to the speaker's chair by Government House Leader Mike Farnworth and Conservative House Leader Á'a:líya Warbus. ""To best serve the people of our province, the debates in the house can be vigorous, but they must be rooted in a mutual respect and a shared commitment to all British Columbians. We show our unity not by agreeing on every item but in affording each other opportunity for healthy and fulsome debate."" He committed to ""protect every member's rights to be heard and foster an environment where diverse perspectives are respected."" At the end of the brief ceremony, Chouhan led all 93 representatives in a stirring rendition of the Canadian national anthem, a move that is rare but not unprecedented in the province's history.

Mulcair: Where do campus conflicts of interest really lie when it comes to supporting Jewish voices?,2025,"The current crisis in the Middle East is provoking, here in Quebec, a conflict between academic freedom and the right to work and study in an atmosphere free from intimidation. The situation in Quebec is uniquely challenging as some Jewish students and CEGEP staff are expressing concerns about antisemitism on campus, while teachers' unions are complaining about interference in academic freedom. Back in December, Higher Education Minister Pascale Déry announced there would be an investigation into these issues by the Quebec government. Recent reports by both the CBC and La Presse quote the FNEEQ teachers' federation as saying that Déry is in an apparent conflict of interest because she had worked with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs prior to being elected. That is a very slippery slope. You want cabinet members who have deep experience in civil society. In my view, it is absolutely fair to question Déry's decisions, no problem there. But when the accusation is that because of her former community involvement, she is in an apparent conflict of interest, red flags have to be raised. You're a step away from saying that because Déry is Jewish that she can't handle this sensitive issue properly. That's a foul ball. I used to work as Director of Legal Affairs at Alliance Quebec. I was later named a member of the Commission d'appel sur la langue d'enseignement by Claude Ryan. I can recall a few comments that I was in an apparent conflict of interest. My approach and that of Mr. Ryan was that my experience helped make me better aware of the issues and able to deal with them. So, too, with Déry. I've had real difficulties with some of her decisions, especially her backing of the CAQ's financial reforms that mostly affected Concordia and McGill. I disagree with her policy, not with who she is. The FNEEQ teachers federation is an umbrella group that includes the teachers' union at Vanier College, for example. I've always had a particular affection for Vanier, my former CEGEP. I marvel at the level of dedication and scholarship of today's student body. I saw that on full display when I was invited to speak at Vanier's ""Model United Nations"" last April. I was wowed by so many students just showing up on a Saturday, on top of all of their preparation. That sort of result can only be achieved by the hard work and dedication of teachers, often putting in volunteer time to help prepare their students for university and for their careers. That being said, there are some very serious questions about what has been happening at Vanier that need to be addressed. The administration has made some surprising decisions that have left Jewish faculty feeling ""othered"". A teacher who submitted a brief on behalf of a larger group of faculty and students, containing their views of the situation at Vanier to a parliamentary committee in Ottawa, says some involved have been silenced and received threats of reprisal. The word ""intimidation"" is, in my view, appropriate here. But teachers have a union and unions, under Quebec law, are obligated to represent their members. Since the Vanier teachers' union is affiliated with FNEEQ, it is fair to point out that that federation has previously expressed positions in favour of boycott divestment and sanctions against the state of Israel. When a teacher is getting called on the carpet by the administration for their expressed opinions, would it be unreasonable for them to have an apprehension of bias from the union that is there to defend them? The report that the government is preparing will have to weigh these difficult issues with wisdom. Students and teachers deserve a report that is objective and helpful, long term, in finding a road map that allows them to navigate academic freedom, freedom of expression and freedom from fear.

"Liberals, NDP court progressives:   Crombie, Stiles tell voters they're the best option to beat Ford's PCs ahead of advance polls",2025,"WTF - who terminates Ford? That was the question posed by Doug Ford's main rivals as NDP Leader Marit Stiles and Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie appealed to each other's supporters to rally to defeat the Progressive Conservatives on Feb. 27. The morning after the provincewide televised debate, Stiles and Crombie urged voters to choose them as the progressive alternative to Ford with advance polls opening Thursday and continuing to Saturday. ""There are people out there who have previously voted Liberal who I think will not see their values reflected in the current Liberal party and leadership,"" the New Democrat said Tuesday in the Spadina-Fort York campaign headquarters of incumbent Chris Glover in Toronto. Stiles derided the Liberals, who only held nine of 124 seats in the legislature at dissolution last month compared to the 28 of the official Opposition NDP. ""They're just trying to make party status,"" she said mockingly, referring to the threshold of 12 seats for official standing in the house. Crombie, who was campaigning in the traditional NDP stronghold of Hamilton, said public opinion polls suggest the Liberals have the best shot at defeating the Tories, who have been in office since 2018. ""As we see the race narrowing between the premier and myself that's why I'm reaching out today to NDP voters and I'm asking them if you want to change our health-care system, please vote for Ontario's Liberals,"" said the Grit leader, who has pledged to cure the chronic shortage of family doctors in the province. ""So yes, it is a very strong message that will appeal to progressive voters, that we can come together, and when we come together, we can defeat the government, and we can ensure that everyone will have a family doctor,"" she said at Clifford Brewing Co. According to the latest Abacus Data survey for the Star, Ford's PCs are at 41 per cent support with Crombie's Liberals at 28 per cent, Stiles's New Democrats at 21 per cent and Mike Schreiner's Greens at six per cent. That's a five percentage point drop for the Tories and a four percentage point increase for the Grits since the previous Abacus survey released Feb. 7. Abacus surveyed 1,500 Ontarians from last Thursday through Saturday using online panels based on the Lucid exchange platform. While opt-in polls cannot be assigned a margin of error, for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have one of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Ford, who had been scheduled to fly to Sault Ste. Marie, was forced to cancel all campaign events due to Monday's plane crash at Pearson International Airport. With the PC campaign grounded, his rivals dominated the news the day after the 90-minute debate moderated by CBC Radio ""Metro Morning"" host David Common, which was broadcast on most major Ontario TV channels. In that debate, Ford warned ""the economy will go down the tubes"" unless the Tories are re-elected next week. ""I know the three of you aren't very good with numbers. All you three believe in taxing people to death,"" the Tory leader chided Stiles, Crombie and Schreiner. The PC chief was less sure-footed when the debate turned to the controversial $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap scandal and his U-turn over allowing and then banning development on 7,400 acres of protected land. ""I think I was pretty clear. I said I was. Then I wasn't, and I went ahead and did it. I apologized to the people,"" he said. Although the RCMP's ongoing criminal investigation into the Greenbelt debacle went unmentioned at the debate, Stiles noted Ford ""says one thing in front of the camera and another thing behind closed doors."" ""You can't trust him on this,"" she said. Crombie, for her part, told the provincewide television audience that it's been ""seven years of lies"" since Ford was elected. ""You're just like your friend Donald Trump, you make things up. You are saying lies,"" she said. That was a shot at Ford's rationale for calling the $189-million snap election 15 months ahead of a vote that had been scheduled for June 2026. The PC chief has said he needs a four-year mandate to ""outlive and outlast"" Trump, because the U.S. president's threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods would devastate Ontario's economy.

"Parties gearing up for Transcona byelection March 18:   Vice-principal runs for NDP, says late education minister was mentor",2025,"A provincial byelection for the Transcona constituency will be held March 18. The seat became vacant after the Jan. 14 death of NDP cabinet minister <a href=""https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2025/01/15/education-minister-altomare-dies-at-61"">Nello Altomare</a>. Premier and party leader Wab Kinew introduced the NDP candidate, Shannon Corbett, at a hastily called news conference in the constituency Tuesday evening. The 53-year-old vice-principal of Transcona Collegiate won the nomination Monday and will be taking time off from her job to run, she said in an interview Tuesday. The Liberal party will field a candidate, said leader Cindy Lamoureux. Two unnamed party members are considering the nomination, Manitoba’s lone Liberal MLA said Tuesday. The Progressive Conservatives did not say whether they have a candidate lined up. Shawn Nason, the former Winnipeg city councillor for Transcona, has said on social media that he will seek the PC nomination. It’s the fourth byelection called in Manitoba in the last three years. In 2022, in Fort Whyte, PC Obby Khan won the seat held by former PC premier Brian Pallister who had resigned. In Thompson, NDP candidate Eric Redhead won the seat that was held by NDP member Danielle Adams, who was killed in a highway collision in December 2021. In 2024, in Tuxedo, the NDP’s Carla Compton won the seat vacated by former PC premier Heather Stefanson. There are currently 33 New Democrats, 21 Progressive Conservatives, one Liberal and one independent in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly. Corbett, who is single and has no children, said she was born, raised and lives in Transcona and it’s the first time she’s run for office. She’s no stranger to politics, though, having supported Altomare when he ran for office. “We shared common values, we shared common ideas about what Transcona deserves,” said Corbett. “I’m really grateful for my time with him. It’s meant the world to me and I do consider him a mentor,” said the school administrator who sees the benefit “every single day” of the school nutrition program that Altomare introduced as education minister. “For me, it’s just really exciting that I can give back to the community,” she said. Advance voting begins on Saturday, March 8, Elections Manitoba said in a news release Tuesday. Now that the byelection has been called, a government communications blackout is in place. The Election Financing Act imposes restrictions on government advertising and publication during an election or a byelection period. There are exceptions, including when the information relates to the usual operations of a government department and “is in continuation of earlier advertisements or publications concerning an ongoing or recurring program or activity.” carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 19, 2025",Nominations; Political advertising; Elections,,2025-02-19,Winnipeg Free Press
Ontario Liberals appeal to NDP voters; NDP leader says they just want party status,2025,"TORONTO - Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie is pushing forward with a new election campaign strategy of trying to appeal to NDP voters, suggesting they should unite behind her as the way to topple the Progressive Conservatives. Crombie is pitching herself as the strongest alternative to PC Leader Doug Ford, though polls suggest the Tories have a sizable lead over both the Liberals and NDP. ""I'm reaching out today to NDP voters, and I'm asking them, if you want to change our health-care system, please vote for Ontario's Liberals, and together, we can change the government,"" Crombie said at an event in Hamilton, a city with deep NDP roots. ""We have the momentum. We have the wind at our sails, but we can't make that change without your support."" NDP Leader Marit Stiles said the Liberals' goal is just to try to get official party status. ""That just tells you everything you need to know about that party, where they're at,"" she said at an announcement in Toronto. ""Their path is they're just trying to make party status. Look the truth is, my focus is, and continues to be, flipping blue seats to orange."" Political parties require at least 12 seats in the legislature to get party status, which gives them more resources and more opportunities to ask questions and participate in debates, and at dissolution the Liberals held nine. Ford had been scheduled to fly to Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., for an announcement, but the party says delays at Pearson International Airport prevented him from leaving Toronto. There is no word on whether he will take questions today from reporters in Toronto instead. Ford last took questions in Washington, D.C., when he and other Canadian premiers travelled there to push back against U.S. tariffs, but the last time he took questions in Ontario during the snap provincial election he called for Feb. 27 was one week ago Monday. Stiles said Ford is ""in hiding."" ""Last night, after the debate, he wouldn't even stand up in front of the reporters,"" she said. ""He will not defend his government. He will not take responsibility for the state of this province. He is hoping that people are just going to stay home and not vote."" - With files from Sammy Hudes in Toronto and Sharif Hassan in Hamilton Related Who won the SECOND Ontario leaders' debate?

Former NDP MLA Selena Robinson heads up this year's Jewish Book Festival,2025,"The 40th Annual JCC Jewish Book Festival When: Feb. 22-27 Where: Jewish Community Centre, 950 West 41st St., Vancouver, and other Lower Mainland venues Info: jccgv.com/jewish-book-festival Yardena Schwartz was already four years into writing a book about a 1929 slaughter of innocent Jewish lives in British Mandate Palestine when Oct. 7 occurred. To say that the 2023 atrocity altered what was to become Ghosts Of A Holy War is an understatement. ""It changed the book tremendously in every way, except for my deadline,"" the New York State-based journalist said. ""My deadline remained the same, only I was now writing a different book. I had to add new chapters and get rid of ones I had already written. But I was also writing with a renewed sense of purpose. The massacre of 1929 took on new meaning because it really was a preview of what we saw on Oct. 7."" Schwartz is one of the guests at this year's Jewish Book Festival. The 40th edition of the annual event also features Benyamin Cohen, whose The Einstein Effect: How the World's Favourite Genius Got Into Our Cars, Our Bathrooms and Our Minds looks at the physics legend's influence on the modern world; actor/comedian Brett Gelman, who has just published his first book, a collection called The Terrifying Realm of the Possible: Nearly True Stories; and former MLA Selina Robinson, who has just published a memoir about her resignation from the provincial NDP caucus under David Eby; and many more. Schwartz was living in Tel Aviv when she was introduced to the descendants of a young Jewish scholar, David Shainberg, who was a victim of the 1929 massacre. From a trove of Shainberg's letters and journal entries, the author has reconstructed the 22-year-old's journey to the Holy Land and his experiences there. Journalist Yardena Schwartz discusses her new book Ghosts of a Holy War Feb 23 at this year's Jewish Book Festival. The tragedy in Hebron is little remembered today. But, she says, what happened in there can shed light on the current crisis in the Middle East. ""It was on a much smaller scale, and yet the massacre really shaped the region we know today,"" said Schwartz, whose reporting has appeared in The Economist, National Geographic, The Wall Street Journal, and NBCNews.com. ""It completely transformed Zionism. It transformed the conflict between Jews and Arabs in what was then British Mandate Palestine. And it set the stage for the conflict as we know it."" Schwartz will speak at the Jewish Book Festival at 6 p.m. on Feb. 23. She will also present at 2 p.m. that day at White Rock South Surrey JCC. On opening night, Feb. 22, Selina Robinson, who was in the legislature from 2013-2024, will discuss her memoir, Truth Be Told. Last year, Premier David Eby drummed Robinson out of caucus, ostensibly for a remark she made calling what is now Israel ""a crappy piece of land."" The ensuing uproar ended with Robinson resigning her post as Minister of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills. In Truth Be Told, she unpacks the incident and reflects on the antisemitism she experienced in government. ""It's been there all along, but it's been, I'll say, managed. In the book I talk about this sense, coming from the federal party, of a clear vein of anti-semitism, anti-Zionism, anti-Israel, for a long time. I became alarmed by it in 2021 and I raised it with higher-ups in the party around their obsession with the one Jewish state given all the human rights violations of Sudan and Iran and China and Russia. Yet, their vitriol and concern is consumed by what's happening in the only democracy in the region. But they're not interested in talking about why this is a problem."" To Robinson, the reaction to her comment demonstrates ""how progressives have lost the plot. That's what worries me. There's no absence of antisemitism on the right. Let's not forget that Pierre Poilievre was hanging out with people who had swastikas during the trucker convoy. It's not about left versus right. My colleagues have demonstrated a lack of progressiveness on this particular issue. They're holding up terrorist groups that are misogynistic and homophobic in everything that they say and do as though their voices need to be heard.

Clock ticking for singh to seize the moment; Rethink urged on Poilievre as biggest threat,2025,"After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be prepared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Québécois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - ensuring the Liberals' sur - vival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pac t with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying.""

The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre.

Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change. ""When you're defining your opponent, it is vitally important for it to be a critique that has an impact on the voter themselves,"" he says. ""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth."" Singh has been calling for Parliament to be recalled to pass a support package for workers and other Canadians who could be hurt by Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity.

Clock ticking for Singh to Seize the moment; Rethink urged on Poilievre as biggest threat,2025,"OTTAWA After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date that Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be prepared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Québécois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - ensuring the Liberals' sur - vival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pac t with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying.""

O T TA WA After Jagmeet Singh spent the fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer it, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" That is the date Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be prepared to fight an election, should Carney, the front-runner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once a leader is named on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have only risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's New Democrats if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Quebecois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP was struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - ensuring the Liberals' survival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pact with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who think the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change.

"Ontario Liberals, NDP best to unite",2025,"It's the 2022 election all over again, except everything is a little bit worse. It's February, not June, and the United States is led by Donald Trump, not Joe Biden. Doug Ford has amassed more scandals but seems poised to win an even bigger majority simply by saying nothing (hot-mic gaffes notwithstanding). Meanwhile, the Liberals and NDP continue to split the vote, with little that's obvious to distinguish the two parties. Once again this election, I'm volunteering with NotOneSeat.ca in an effort to defeat Ford through strategic voting and a temporarily united opposition. This time, however, our tone is less about sunshine and unity, and more about asking, ""Why is the opposition being wilfully ignorant?"" Everyone is talking about vote-splitting, again. Neither the Liberals nor the NDP has chosen a feasible plan to deal with this perennial problem by swallowing their partisanship pride and fielding candidates strategically. Instead, both parties have opted to fight it out for second place. We've all seen this movie before, and the ending stinks. Yet if the opposition parties were to announce that they intended to work as a united front against Ford, they would likely receive a massive boost in both positive PR and the polls. Such was the case for Natasha Doyle-Merrick, the NDP candidate for Eglinton-Lawrence, who withdrew shortly before the deadline to avoid splitting the vote and delivering the riding to Ford's party. The Liberals lost in Eglinton-Lawrence by 524 votes in 2022, with the NDP finishing more than 12,000 votes behind them, having received fewer than 4,000 votes. Doyle-Merrick's decision has been widely praised on social media, but instead of the NDP turning it into a positive story about putting people before politics, they have so far said nothing. Vince Gasparro, the Liberal candidate for Eglinton-Lawrence, praised the decision in a statement as ""a testament to who she is."" His response was much classier than the Liberal campaign's text that read, ""even the other party recognizes this is a Bonnie versus Doug race."" Not according to the polls, it isn't. Everyone is for co-operation if it means their opponent will drop out, and certainly the Liberals threw the New Democrats under the strategic bus when they collapsed in 2018. The NDP may point to their constitution, which requires them to run a candidate in every riding, as if they could not collectively agree to do things differently this one time. The Liberals have no such excuse; instead, they'll likely fall back on assuming that disillusioned Progressive Conservative and jaded NDP supporters will eventually vote for them - even though the polls haven't changed very much since 2022. Even a no-cost joint announcement from the opposition parties that they intend to work together rather than prop up a Ford minority government, with the details to be negotiated later, would be positive PR. Still, not all candidates in the running would rather eat glass than work the other parties. York-South Weston's NDP candidate, Faisal Hassan, has been refreshingly pragmatic about taking a co-operative approach. ""I want results,"" he told me. ""I want to work for the community and get results for them, and that means we can work with (the Liberals) to make things better for the people."" Similarly, the Liberal candidate for Beaches-East York, Mary-Margaret McMahon, sees a lot of value in co-operation. ""Ontarians want to see us working together for the greater good,"" she says. ""They want to see collaboration."" If only such voices were louder. The Liberals and NDP need to stop kidding themselves that the average voter sees a meaningful difference between them. The stark contrast between Ford and everyone else mirrors what's going on in the U.S., where anyone seems a better option than Trump. Nobody wants a two-party system in Ontario, mind you, but anyone would be better than Ford. When my sink leaks, what matters most is preventing further water damage, not working out the minor differences between the plumbers who can fix it. In Ontario, the house is flooded, and Ford keeps ripping out pipes to sell for scrap. After years under his leadership, what Ontario needs now is to fix health care, the housing crisis, our broken schools, child care and unemployment - and to cancel the many deals Ford has made that appear to enrich billionaires to nobody else's benefit. The Tories hold a commanding lead in the polls, but after seven years of a Ford government, many of the problems we face have become much worse. The Liberals and NDP need to work together and figure out the details among themselves - and perhaps, while they're at it, figure out a better electoral system so that we never have to do this again.

Labour council endorses all local NDP candidates as PCs get Windsor union support,2025,"On the same day as the Windsor and District Labour Council endorsed all four Windsor area NDP candidates for the Feb. 27 election, Doug Ford's PCs announced they got the endorsement of a local union. The labour council said it was putting its support behind Lisa Gretzky in Windsor West, Gemma Grey-Hall in Windsor-Tecumseh, Rachael Mills in Essex and Christian Sachs in Chatham-Kent - Leamington ""Windsor-area workers and their families just can't trust Doug Ford's priorities,"" labour council president Mario Spagnuolo said in a news release. ""Whether it's U.S. tariffs, the high cost of living, or the shortage of family doctors, Lisa Gretzky, Gemma Grey-Hall, Rachael Mills, and Christian Sachs are definitely Windsor-Essex's best choice."" But while some labour leaders, including Ontario Federation of Labour president Laura Walton, describe Doug Ford's projected 'friend of the worker' election image as a ""gimmick"" to garner votes, others are throwing their support behind the Progressive Conservatives, including LiUNA (Labourers International Union of North America) and the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association. On the same day as the local labour council gave its NDP endorsements, Unifor Local 47 president Jeff Mark, representing 115 Windsor, Chatham and Owen Sound skilled communications specialists, said he was ""proud to endorse Doug Ford and the Ontario PCs.""

"Oshawa’s NDP incumbent faces a tough re-election in a changing city:   Jennifer French holds the lone orange provincial riding in the region, but Oshawa isn’t the union town it used to be",2025,"A bitter wind heralding snow was blowing as Jennifer French made her way up the icy driveways of an Oshawa neighbourhood last Wednesday, a clipboard in her hand. A veteran of election canvassing, the city’s sole MPP wore her full combat uniform: fleece-lined blue jeans, light-blue parka, a tuque of NDP orange and what she calls her yard boots – calf-high, insulated numbers that she wore in the schoolyard back when she was a teacher monitoring recess. With the Feb. 27 snap election called by Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford coming up fast, she is canvassing for hours every day, first outside while it’s light, then in apartment hallways after dark. Whether it will pay off is far from clear. Despite her reputation as a likeable, hard-working representative, Ms. French is facing a tough re-election fight in a changing city. Oshawa was once a solid union town. General Motors Canada was born here more than a century ago when a local carriage maker started building horseless carriages. At one point, 28,000 people worked in the vast GM complex in the lakeside city that now has a population of 175,000, an hour’s drive down the 401 highway from Toronto. Oshawa’s pride in its role as Canada’s motor city was expressed in its former corny slogan: ""The city that motovates Canada."" But after booming in the postwar decades as North Americans embraced the automobile, the local industry went into decline. Today, GM has just 3,100 unionized workers at the Oshawa plant. The company shut down production in the city altogether in 2019, but announced the next year it would reopen. Far more residents now work in services, education, energy and health. The city boasts three postsecondary institutions, including Ontario Tech University, and a big health care hub, Lakeridge. Thousands of new residents have moved into the flourishing north end of the city near the 407 highway, many of them exiles from Toronto’s congestion and sky-high housing prices. The federal riding, long represented by Ed Broadbent, leader of the NDP for 14 years, has been held by Conservative Colin Carrie since 2004. Provincially, six of the seven MPPs in Oshawa’s Durham region are members of Mr. Ford’s party, leaving the riding held by Ms. French the only patch of orange in a blue sea. Will even it disappear this time? Mr. Ford’s party has a lead in provincewide polls, with the latest giving it 44-per-cent support, compared with 29 per cent for the Liberals, 17 per cent for the NDP and 6 per cent for the Greens. If the numbers hold until election day, Mr. Ford will win a third consecutive majority, the first Ontario leader to do so since Conservative Leslie Frost in the 1950s. While Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie and NDP Leader Marit Stiles struggle for attention and recognition, Mr. Ford has been all over the headlines for his vocal role in Canada’s confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump over his threats to impose tariffs and make this country the 51st American state. Mr. Ford’s stand resonates with some Oshawa residents. ""He’s the one that seems to say, ‘If you want to play rough, we’re gonna play rough with you,’"" said Susan Clarke, 64, a server at a downtown restaurant. Nelson Wiseman, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, says that, for Mr. Ford’s PCs, the Oshawa riding is ""ripe for the picking."" The NDP came into the election ""on its back foot,"" Mr. Wiseman said, and has raised much less money than the two other major parties. Though labour traditionally backs the NDP, the union at the GM plant, Unifor Local 222, is not endorsing any party, focusing instead on encouraging members simply to vote. Even some union activists are keeping their options open. Michelle Kimble, 46, calls herself ""union born and bred."" She has worked for GM since 2004 and now acts as a human-rights rep for the Local, handling complaints about sexism, ageism and harassment. She likes Ms. French, but counts herself undecided. Though she thinks it was wrong for Mr. Ford to call a snap election, she conceded he has helped draw attention to the danger from Mr. Trump, whose threatened tariffs on Canadian-made cars could devastate this country’s auto industry. ""I will be open to any party that recognizes auto is huge for Canada,"" Ms. Kimble said. The local Progressive Conservative candidate seems content to ride on Mr. Ford’s broad coattails. Jerry Ouellette held the seat from 1995 to 2014, when Ms. French knocked him off. After a gap of a decade, he is hoping to return the favour. Mr. Ouellette is running a low-profile, play-it-safe campaign. Neither PC media managers nor his Oshawa campaign office responded to interview requests for this story. He declined to debate Ms. French. His online presence is slight. A campaign leaflet shows him in a grip-and-grin handshake with the PC Leader. Mr. Ford, it says on the back, needs a strong mandate to protect Ontario from ""Mr. Trump’s threats."" If Ms. French is discouraged by all of this, she is not showing it. ""I know Doug Ford would like nothing more than to not have me at Queen’s Park,"" she says in an interview at her brightly lit campaign office, a former cannabis shop. ""But I ain’t going down without a fight."" She called Mr. Ford’s defiant Captain Canada act a pose, and his Canada is Not for Sale cap a joke. ""I have sat across Doug Ford for seven years and watched him sell off Ontario,"" she said, pointing to his government’s deal with an overseas company to put a waterpark and spa at Ontario Place on Toronto’s waterfront. The best way for Oshawa voters to send a message to Mr. Ford, she says, is to rally behind the NDP: In other words, her. A campaign leaflet shows that her support has fallen over the years, from 47 per cent in her first election in 2014, to 45 in 2018, to 42 in 2022, when she won by just 757 votes. Each time, her main rival was a Progressive Conservative. The Liberals, a bar chart shows, usually finish third. Their candidate this time is Viresh Bansal, who says on his website that he has ""extensive experience providing IT support to government and businesses."" The message from Ms. French is clear: Don’t waste your vote on him. As the leaflet puts it, ""In Oshawa, only Jennifer French can defeat Doug Ford’s Conservatives."" Canvassing charges her up. Making her way along the sidewalk last week, she stopped at the home of Raoul Lochan, 67, a retired GM worker. Ms. French, he said, is ""the best thing that ever happened around this place."" He already had a Jennifer French sign in front of his house, but told her he wanted something bigger and more visible. She laughed and promised to get him one. A minute later, she recognized a young woman who used to be one of her students. Before they said goodbye, Ms. French had persuaded her to put an NDP sign in her apartment window. Ms. French said she knows better than to say she is feeling good about how things will turn out on Feb. 27, but recalled that the polls put her dead last when she first ran in 2014, far behind the PCs.

"Clock ticking for Singh before he loses his chance, again, to show Canadians he brings change",2025,"OTTAWA - After federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh spent his fall struggling to prove he could be the change Canadians want, time is now ticking down for the leader of Canada's New Democrats to show he can offer that, against the man expected to replace Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. For strategists and former staffers, including his past communications director, that means rethinking Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as Singh's biggest threat. ""It would be worthwhile to spend some time defining Mark Carney before he is chosen as Liberal leader,"" said Melanie Richer, who left Singh's office in 2023. ""If he calls an election on March 10, it's too late."" Opposition calls for Parliament to resume as Trump says he's moving ahead with tariffs, decision coming on Canadian oil 'This caught them by surprise': Why Jagmeet Singh broke his deal with the Liberals That is the date Jennifer Howard, the NDP's national campaign director, gave in a memo circulated to candidates and campaign teams last week as to when they should be prepared to fight an election, should Carney, the frontrunner of the Liberals' leadership contest, choose to trigger one instead of going to Parliament, once the race concludes on March 9. Carney himself confirmed he was open to calling an early election. Expectations that he may so do have only risen since polls began to show the Liberals surging in public opinion, the first signs the party may be climbing out of the hole it landed in under Trudeau. Phillipe Fournier of the polling aggregator 338Canada.com said one survey suggests trouble could be brewing for Singh's NDP if they see their support drop even further as voters turn to a Carney-led Liberal party, which some polls suggest may be happening, despite the fact the contest is not yet over. ""The NDP would get really close to single digits,"" he told National Post in a recent interview. The New Democrats are trailing both the Liberals and Conservatives and hold fourth-place party status in the House of Commons, behind the Bloc Quebecois. Abacus Data CEO David Coletto says New Democrats ""should be just scared completely"" about the idea of their support dropping and agrees they would risk party status. U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of a tariff war, coupled with Trudeau choosing not to seek re-election and Carney emerging as a fresh face, has left the main federal parties watching the political ground shift beneath their feet. But even before that, the NDP were struggling. Singh found the party dragged down by the supply-and-confidence agreement he struck with Trudeau after the last federal election in March 2022. In exchange for passing government bills - ensuring the Liberals' survival in the minority Parliament - the NDP saw some of their priorities enacted into law, such as dental care, pharmacare and rental supports. There was some hope the party's fortunes would improve once Singh announced before the start of last fall that he had ""ripped up"" the deal, but those expectations never materialized in a significant way. The reason? ""They kept voting for them,"" said Karl Belanger, a former NDP national director and longtime political staffer who left Parliament Hill in 2016. ""They kept supporting them and keeping them in power, so that distance that they were trying to create was never established."" At the same time, the federal Conservatives pummelled the freshly unshackled Singh with ads and attacks about him being a ""sellout"" by voting with the government, which the NDP argued was to deliver programs and help to Canadians. An NDP strategist, speaking on the condition of background in order to speak freely, said when the Liberals ""coughed up the ball"" the NDP simply ""didn't catch it."" Richer said the pact with the Liberals ended up costing the party voters who switch between casting a ballot for them and the Conservatives, in ridings where both are competitive. Those who switch between voting Liberal and New Democrat liked the deal, she said. Now that those voters see Carney as the Liberal option instead of Trudeau, they appear open to leaving. ""Do I think that's a solid number? Do I think we've lost those folks for sure? Absolutely not,"" said Richer. Carney is running his Liberal leadership campaign as an outsider, despite having advised Trudeau and served in a special role for the party. Federal Liberal leadership candidate Mark Carney speaks during a news conference in Vancouver, B.C. on Thursday. Besides trying to appeal to Liberals concerned that the party did not prioritize the economy enough under Trudeau, the two-time former central banker is pitching himself to progressives who feel the Liberals did not live up its promises on climate change. Emily Williams, a spokeswoman for Carney's campaign, said he hosted an event with more than 1,000 people in Vancouver last week and staged another 500 person-event in Winnipeg and 400 in Kelowna. Belanger said the NDP must stop Carney from painting himself ""as Canada's saviour,"" when the country is anxious because of Trump. ""They need to go after him,"" he said. ""They can't let him ... escape from his past, from his record, from who he is, from what he's defending, from what he's saying."" Belanger pointed to comments Carney made about bringing government spending into balance within three years. ""That's Liberal austerity, he says, ""that's what's going to hit you."" The Conservatives, who have also seen some of their support slide to Carney, released their first ad against him last week, while the Liberals took out one against Poilievre. Singh has so far attacked Carney along the same lines he has targeted Poilievre, saying both are leaders who choose to ""stand with the billionaires"" by making promises like repealing the capital gains tax hike, in contrast to the NDP, which Singh says stands with ordinary Canadians. He also took aim at how Carney said he disagreed with the GST holiday the NDP helped pass, which ended Sunday. Belanger says because Conservatives have been effective in attacking Singh for his expensive tastes, he believes it may be difficult for Canadians to see much of a difference between him and Carney on the issue of wealth. ""Jagmeet Singh wears a Rolex,"" he notes. For Brad Lavigne, who worked as former national campaign director when Jack Layton delivered the NDP its ""orange wave"" back in 2011, Singh still has time to tell Canadians who Carney is ""through a progressive lens"" and outline why he is the wrong choice for non-conservative voters hungry for change. ""When you're defining your opponent, it is vitally important for it to be a critique that has an impact on the voter themselves,"" he says. ""If Mr. Carney is out of touch with the struggles of everyday Canadians, it has to be put through the lens of how (being out of touch) affects them ... there has to be a little bit more depth."" Singh has been calling for Parliament to be recalled to pass a support package for workers and other Canadians who could be hurt by Trump's tariffs. At the same time, he says nothing has changed about his intention to bring down the government at the first opportunity he gets. But with the possibility of an election happening before that, Singh may have lost his chance.

Ontario Election 2025: NDP Leader Marit Stiles puts focus on northern highways,2025,"Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles reiterated her pledge on Saturday to make northern Ontario highways safer, promising to widen some highways and to end private highway maintenance contracts. Her announcement in Thunder Bay came after all four of the province's main party leaders clashed in their first debate on Friday in North Bay, held specifically to discuss northern issues such as infrastructure, road safety and an addictions crisis that has hit many communities hard. ""Nobody relies on highways as much as the people in northern Ontario,"" Stiles said at an education centre. ""It is crucial to be getting anywhere, and, frankly, crucial to be able to do just daily things."" ""Everybody deserves a safe and well-maintained highway,"" she added. Stiles promised earlier this past week that, if her party formed government, it would widen Highway 11/17 and Highway 69 in northern Ontario and bring snow clearance and highway maintenance back under public control. She has also vowed to upload the responsibility for some municipal roadways back to the province, increase training for truck drivers and fast-track passenger train projects in the north. Stiles did not provide an exact timeline for the projects, but vowed to start them within the first 100 days of her term should she become premier. She also did not provide a cost estimate of her commitments, but said the province ""can't afford not to do this."" Elsewhere, Green Leader Mike Schreiner made campaign stops in Huntsville and Gravenhurst on Saturday. Schreiner reiterated his party's vow to increase per-student funding, reduce class sizes and fix the province's school repair backlog. Neither Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford nor Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie had public events scheduled, but both parties spent time digging up information on each others' candidates. A Saturday news release from the PCs unearthed a 2012 social-media post from Liberal Ottawa-Centre candidate Thomas Simpson in which the party said he posted: ""Consent is not sexy #success."" The PC Party called the post ""offensive"" and ""a slap in the face to survivors of sexual violence."" ""Doug Ford must be pretty desperate if he is digging up social-media posts from more than a decade ago,"" Liberal press secretary Bahoz Dara Aziz said in a written statement. She provided links to news articles about previous controversial comments by Ford and offered no indication that the Liberals would be prepared to drop Simpson as a candidate. The exchange came after the PCs attacked another Liberal candidate on Friday for his past social-media posts. The candidate apologized and the party responded similarly, saying the comments were made over a decade ago. The leaders are scheduled to debate each other again on Monday in Toronto.

AHS paid $28M for drugs after stop-use order: documents; NDP demands legislature be reconvened so controversies can be 'aired in public',2025,"Alberta Health Services (AHS) issued a $28-million prepayment to Edmonton importer MHCare for a pharmaceutical order that included Parol brand acetaminophen just over two weeks after hospitals were ordered to stop using it, according to internal documents obtained by Postmedia. On July 26, 2023, AHS issued the prepayment for years three, four, and five of the contract it signed in December of 2022 for medication imported from Turkish company Atabay. On July 10, 2023, AHS issued a bulletin to hospitals instructing them to cease using Parol, citing ""the resolution of the Canadian acetaminophen oral liquid shortage."" ""The prepayment made on July 26, 2023, was for a broader pharmaceutical order and not limited to Parol,"" a statement from AHS reads. ""That payment was for the remaining balance of the original $70-million agreement, and we have received $21 million in product, bringing the full prepayment amount (amount paid with no product received to date) to $49 million. Of the $21 million in product received, $14 million was Parol."" In its statement, AHS said it was informed at the time that the prepayment was required to secure ""favourable pricing, support production adjustments, ensure uninterrupted availability, and enable manufacturer investments to meet Health Canada requirements."" It adds, ""AHS' understanding is that MHCare has been awaiting Health Canada approval for these additional products."" Applications for drug approvals are tracked in a publicly-available Health Canada database, but it contains no entry for either Atabay or MHCare. Health Canada approved the import of 1.5 million bottles of medication from Turkey but declined to approve further shipments of what had been an order of five million bottles after the domestic supply levels of acetaminophen returned to normal in mid-2023. AHS has not confirmed what medication it's seeking to import, but documents reviewed by Postmedia indicate intravenous acetaminophen, amoxicillin oral suspension, ketamine and ASA suppositories have all been considered. Approval for a given new drug would require a new application and would be contingent on the supply of that drug within Alberta, which can vary over time. The province has attempted to justify its decision to import medication by citing the Canada-wide shortage of children's pain medication that was apparent in late 2022. The imported medication's arrival was delayed by regulatory approvals and was made available for sale in pharmacies as the shortages were ending. It was also sold behind the counter due to its differing dosage compared to domestic acetaminophen, which also made it unpopular with health-care workers who cited its thick consistency as being a further safety risk for patients who receive the medication via feeding tubes. The province had planned to recoup some of the money by selling it to other provinces but abandoned the plan by the fall of 2023 due to a lack of interest. 'THE WORST CORRUPTION IN ALBERTA HISTORY': NDP The purchase has also been at the centre of recent allegations of improper procurement procedures that are under investigation by Alberta's auditor general that have prompted calls for the resignation of Health Minister Adriana LaGrange. Opposition health critic Sarah Hoffman told Postmedia in a statement the prepayment is an example of why such an investigation is necessary. ""The alleged bloated contracts to the UCP's friends are at the heart of the worst corruption in Alberta history,"" she said. ""This issue and all related ones need to be aired in public, and a good place to start would be the immediate reconvening of the legislature so Albertans get answers.""

Applications for drug approvals are tracked in a publicly-available Health Canada database, but it contains no entry for either Atabay or MHCare. Health Canada approved the import of 1.5 million bottles of medication from Turkey but declined to approve further shipments of what had been an order of five million bottles after the domestic supply levels of acetaminophen returned to normal in mid-2023. AHS has not confirmed what medication it's seeking to import, but documents reviewed by Postmedia indicate intravenous acetaminophen, amoxicillin oral suspension, ketamine and ASA suppositories have all been considered. Approval for a given new drug would require a new application and would be contingent on the supply of that drug within Alberta, which can vary over time. The province has attempted to justify its decision to import medication by citing the Canada-wide shortage of children's pain medication that was apparent in late 2022. The imported medication's arrival was delayed by regulatory approvals and was made available for sale in pharmacies as the shortages were ending. It was also sold behind the counter due to its differing dosage compared to domestic acetaminophen, which also made it unpopular with health-care workers who cited its thick consistency as being a further safety risk for patients who receive the medication via feeding tubes. The province had planned to recoup some of the money by selling it to other provinces but abandoned the plan by the fall of 2023 due to a lack of interest. 'THE WORST CORRUPTION IN ALBERTA HISTORY': NDP The purchase has also been at the centre of recent allegations of improper procurement procedures that are under investigation by Alberta's auditor general that have prompted calls for the resignation of Health Minister Adriana LaGrange. Opposition health critic Sarah Hoffman told Postmedia in a statement the prepayment is an example of why such an investigation is necessary. ""The alleged bloated contracts to the UCP's friends are at the heart of the worst corruption in Alberta history,"" she said. ""This issue and all related ones need to be aired in public, and a good place to start would be the immediate reconvening of the legislature so Albertans get answers.""

NDP candidate drops out of race; Helps liberal,2025,"Ontario New Democratic Party candidate Natasha Doyle-Merrick has withdrawn from the provincial race for the riding of Eglinton-Lawrence, saying she had no hope of winning and would rather help the Liberals beat the Progressive Conservative candidate there. ""Many residents cannot afford another four years of an Ontario Conservative government. This is why I have decided it was best to no longer be in this election, as it is clear that it is a two-party contest between the Ontario Liberals and Ontario Conser vatives,"" Doyle-Merrick wrote on Thursday, announcing her decision. The PCs' Michelle Cooper said it showed the weakness of her opponents' campaigns and candidates. ""This announcement from the NDP only proves the Liberals and NDP have no plan to fight for our community. They're not serious parties - they can't even meet the basic test of running a full slate of candidates,"" she wrote in a statement to National Post. ""The Ontario PCs are the only party with a plan to protect Ontario, and as your next MPP for Eglinton-Lawrence, I'm ready to be a strong voice for our community."" Since 2018, the riding has been held by the PC MPP Robin Martin, despite being held by the Liberals for nearly two decades before that. Martin announced her intention to step down in early November. Cooper, who secured the PC nomination in December, previously served as executive director of the Ontario PC Party Fund. The Eglinton-Lawrence riding remained sharply contested in the 2022 election, with Martin besting the Liberal opponent by only a few hundred votes and a margin of less than two per cent. Doyle-Merrick had run for the NDP then but came in a distant third, with less than 10 per cent of the vote, while the PCs and Liberals each took over 40 per cent. ""This election is crucial because the past seven years Doug Ford and the Ontario Conservatives have been absent and ineffective, showing zero interest in delivering the support ALL residents in Eglinton-Lawrence need to thrive,"" she added, without explicitly naming either the Liberal candidate Vince Gasparro or the PC candidate. Gasparro is a former director of Postmedia Network, publisher of National Post. He stepped down in September to enter the race and previously served as a senior adviser in Paul Martin's Liberal government and John Tory's Toronto mayoralty.

"NDP Leader lays out plan for more docs, relief on grocery bills; Marit Stiles unveils Northern Ontario platform during stop at Science North in Sudbury",2025,"Hiring more doctors and reining in costs for food and housing are among the NDP's priorities for Northern Ontario. ""There's so much more we can do to uplift this region and stand with the families who call it home,"" said Marit Stiles, in announcing the NDP's Northern platform Thursday in Sudbury. ""I promise to tackle the cost of living - with concrete actions that put real money back in your pocket every month - and deliver health care when and where you need it."" The NDP leader was flanked by local MPPs Jamie West and France Gelinas, as well as incumbent John Vanthof of Timiskaming-Cochrane and candidates David Timeriski and Jim Ronholm, respectively seeking to represent Algoma-Manitoulin and Parry Sound-Muskoka. She was also joined by a variety of supporters from Sudbury who are active in the fields of health, labour and education. ""I'd like to point out we have a very strong Northern team,"" said Stiles. ""The people who are standing with me, this is in their blood - they come from these places, they represent a lot of the sectors that are important up here, they are working people."" Premier Doug Ford, by contrast, only pays lip service to the region, in her view. ""I think respect for Northern Ontario is a critical issue in this election,"" she said. ""Doug Ford wants to exploit the North, for his own ends, but he isn't really putting back in the investment that Northern communities deserve and need."" Meanwhile, Northerners are being disproportionally hurt, she said, by the government's failure to control inflation and sufficiently fund the areas that are most essential to their health and livelihood. ""Food prices and other costs are up all across Ontario, but in Northern Ontario, just look at how much you are paying for groceries and everyday essentials,"" said Stiles. ""The cost of housing is through the roof."" An NDP government would take immediate steps to help Northerners with their bills, including a grocery rebate program that would deliver $122 per month ""to families who need it the most,"" she said, adding this would be ""a game-changer for a lot of people out there."" As well, the NDP plans to force big retailers to tell customers if they raise prices by more than two per cent in a week, and establish a consumer watchdog ""who will stop the price gouging,"" said Stiles. Getting housing costs under control is also critical, the NDP leader said, noting the rents in Sudbury have climbed by $369/month since the Progressive Conservatives took office in 2018. Through its Homes Ontario plan, the NDP is promising to ""provide grants, low-cost financing, public land and other supports to create at least 300,000 new permanently affordable public, non-profit and co-op homes within 10 years, with Northern Ontario getting its fair share,"" according to the platform released Thursday. Equally, if not more, important is meeting the demand for healthcare in the North, including making sure everyone has access to a family physician or nurse practitioner. ""I'm going to give you an example - in Hearst, it's three out of four who don't have a doctor,"" said Stiles. ""I think Northerners deserve better."" She said her party will ""hire 200 family doctors and 150 specialists all across Northern Ontario,"" as well as ""double residency spots at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine University. And we're also going to bring back the midwifery program to Sudbury, because families need to get the care they need right here at home."" Alanna Makinson, a fourth-year med student at NOSM U, said she has experienced the health-care crisis in the region first-hand, both through her placements in rural and remote communities, and in her own search for a physician since moving to Sudbury. ""My husband and I know what it's like to live in Northern Ontario and not have a family doctor,"" she said. ""Not even someone training to work in health care is sheltered from the primary-care crisis."" She said it has been a privilege to train with physicians across the North, ""but we need more of them. And we need to support Northern doctors and communities with an expanded and properly funded locum program."" Makinson said she applauds the NDP plan to do just that, as well as ""expand the Northern Ontario Health Travel grant to ease the cost burden on patients and their families travelling for care."" Travel in general can be challenging for Northern Ontarians, noted Stiles, and it doesn't have to be that way. ""You shouldn't be scared for your life as you travel on Northern highways,"" said the NDP leader. ""It's not rocket science to fix this problem. We're going to bring that money that Doug Ford spent down south back up to the North to widen Highways 11 and 17, as well as 69, and we are going to build the Cochrane bypass."" In terms of education, the NDP said it would provide more funds for Francophone programs, including French immersion, as well ""make sure school buses in the North are reliable so your child can get to and from school safely."" It is also pledging to ""create a universal School Food Program so that every child, from Sudbury, to Fort Frances, to Sioux Lookout can focus on learning, not their hunger,"" according to the platform. Liana Holm, a local educator and union rep for Rainbow elementary teachers, said the sector has suffered under the current PC government. ""There is $1,500 less per-student funding since Doug Ford came into office,"" she said. ""That means bil- lions of dollars of cuts to the education system since 2018."" Holm said 70,000 children are currently waiting for autism supports, while issues of mental health and violence within school settings are not being sufficiently addressed. ""Ninety-five per cent of our schools need mental-health supports, and 77 per cent of our EFTO (Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario) members say they have personally experienced or witnessed their colleagues being the victim of violence,"" she said. A recent survey undertaken by the union found more than half of parents believe the education system has gotten worse in the past three years, and the vast majority - 80 per cent - feel the government isn't providing enough funding, noted Holm. ""Learning has been disrupted because the Ford government refuses to invest in our public education system,"" she said. ""Students needs are going unmet every single day. We need change. We need a provincial government that values education."" The NDP, she said, is ""the only party that has come up with a platform that includes elementary schools."" At present the NDP holds seven of the region's 13 seats, including both Sudbury and Nickel Belt, while the PCs reign in the remaining six, having picked up a couple in the last election. Stiles said she is confident, however, that momentum will not be on the side of Conservatives this time around, as many voters are fed up and see the timing of the election as a cynical power grab. ""I think Doug Ford called a snap election in the middle of winter hoping that people wouldn't get to the polls, but what I'm hearing as I go around Ontario is that people are not going to stand for it,"" she said. ""There are a lot of people willing to make their way to the polls, I'll tell you, even through a snowstorm, to cast their vote for change and a government on their side.""

Ontario election: Widening Highway 69 a 'long-term goal' - NDP; Court file,2025,"The NDP has laid out a series of steps it says it will take to improve highway safety in Northern Ontario if it forms the next provincial government. France Gelinas, who is running to keep the Nickel Belt seat for the NDP, said the measures include finishing the widening of Highway 69 to four lanes, making snow tires in Northern Ontario mandatory and spending money on rail transportation to reduce truck traffic. ""Safety on Highways 69, 144, and 17 remains a top concern for Northern Ontario residents,"" the NDP said in a release. ""These highways are our lifelines, used daily for work, school, and community activities, yet they remain unsafe, putting people's safety at risk."" In Opposition, the NDP said its Northern MPPs ""have worked tirelessly to bring attention to these issues and advocate for meaningful changes ... ""France Gélinas and the Ontario NDP have consistently worked to improve highway safety. From exposing inadequate winter maintenance through the Northern Road Report to introducing legislation aimed at strengthening driver training and highway standards, these MPPs have led the charge in demanding government accountability."" The NDP said the Ford government has ignored the concerns, ""claiming that Ontario's highways are among the safest in North America. Investigative reports and lived experiences from Northern residents tell a different story. ""Poor winter road maintenance and poorly trained commercial drivers and the companies that enable them are putting lives at risk. The time for action is now."" In what she called a plan designed by Northerners for Northerners, Gelinas said an NDP would implement immediate and longterm solutions to make the region's highways safer, including: - Immediate action: All new commercial drivers must be test- ed by Ministry of Transportation (MTO) inspectors instead of private companies to ensure proper training. - Short-term measures: Highway maintenance operations should return to MTO where needed, as well as the oversight and increased staffing for inspections and enforcement. - Medium-term improvements: Mandatory snow tires for Northern Ontario vehicles, better winter driving training, stricter enforcement of commercial vehicle standards, and more rest stops with maintained facilities. - Long-term goals: Paving and widening shoulders on Highway 144, finishing the widening of Highway 69 to four lanes, expanding Highway 17 into divided four-lane highways, and investing in rail transportation to reduce truck traffic. The widening of Highway 69 is of particular interest to Sudburians, since it is a critical commercial link to Toronto. Political and business leaders argue a wider highway will make travelling between Sudbury and Toronto safer and quicker. Ontario's three major provincial political parties have been committed to completing the four-laning of the highway from Sudbury to Toronto since 1991. Work began three decades ago but a series of delays, including negotiations with First Nations that live along the corridor, have delayed the project. As a result, about 70 kilometres still remain to be built. While the NDP said it is committed to expanding Highway 69, the party has it listed as a longterm goal. In the 2014 provincial election, then NDP leader Andrea Horwath said an NDP government would finish the work by 2016. The Liberal government at the time said it would finish the widening by 2017. Gelinas has held Nickel Belt since 2007. Challenging her this election are Natalie Labbee (Liberal), Randy Hazlett (PC), James Chretien (Libertarians) and Paul DiVincenzo (New Blue Party).

Stiles Seeks Visibility; Ontario Votes Ontario NDP leader works to raise her's and party's profile with voters,2025,"Marit Stiles is in a good spot. For a party leader in a snap election, her weakness is not in her starting position. The Ontario New Democratic Party has won Opposition status in the last two elections, and as leader, Stiles whipped the votes of 28 members against a Progressive Conservative majority. That is a good run for this traditionally third place party, and a solid base camp from which to push higher toward government. But in this election, the current premier, Doug Ford, seems to be running against the president of the United States, and on track for a third majority, almost unheard of in Canadian politics. When he does acknowledge other Ontario parties, he treats the third-place Liberals - long obliterated in the legislature with fewer MPPs than most people have fingers, their leader Bonnie Crombie without even her own seat - as his main competition. The challenge for Stiles, therefore, is getting noticed. When she does, it tends to go well. Stiles projects a positive, sunny tone, typically coming across as affable and smiling, approachable and optimistic, said Geneviève Tellier, professor of political science at the University of Ottawa. This personal communication style aligns well with the NDP's political project, she said. ""The NDP has always showcased themselves as a caring party, attending to the needs of those who need more from the state,"" Tellier said. ""It's hard to sell that in an ag - gressive tone. I see a good fit between the party and their leader."" ""Used to be, you had to act like a man ... like Margaret Thatcher,"" Tellier said. ""I think that this has changed a lot, generally speaking in Canada, but more so on the Ontarian scene. With Stiles, we are in this continuity."" Last week, Stiles was in Ottawa, where she once studied at Carleton University, and she addressed her audience in French. It was not polished Quebec diction, but a sort of Queen's Park French, a stilted work in progress, but an effort all the same. ""She's kind of at the beginning, but francophones applaud that,"" Tellier said. Likewise, earlier this month in Windsor, addressing the auto industry and the union voters so key to the NDP base, Tellier saw a party leader who can credibly connect policy to her own values without coming across like she has been workshopped and focus-grouped by her communications team. ""I think we have seen stability with her since she was elected. We didn't see her change. She could have changed, especially with Doug Ford in front of her. But she remained constant in how she presents herself to the population,"" Tellier said. ""She did not change. She's constant. It works well for her."" Elizabeth Goodyear-Grant, professor and graduate chair in political studies at Queen's University, saw Stiles recently in Kingston, supporting the local candidate. ""I think that she has an image that seems to me is true to who she is as a person, as someone who really is approachable, warm, supportive,"" Goodyear-Grant said. Her weakness is in visibility, Goodyear-Grant said, in part because her experience is largely in political backrooms. This gives her knowledge and connections, but it does not drive votes. ""That visibility piece means that she is going to have to work a bit harder to introduce herself to the electorate,"" Goodyear-Grant said. Marit Stiles, 55, was born in Newfoundland and grew up on a small family farm in the St. John's area, the elder of two girls to Kathy Stiles, who worked in environmental education, and Geoff Stiles, an anthropology professor at Memorial University. Her name is frequently mispronounced, and she has described her equanimity about this. It was suggested by her parents' Norwegian friends. The first syllable rhymes with ""car,"" not ""care."" It is not pronounced like ""merit."" And yet it usually is. She moved to Ottawa to attend Carleton University when her family moved to Africa, and later she went to Toronto to work as executive assistant to northern Ontario New Democrat MPP Gilles Bisson, and then northern development minister Shelley Martel. She worked in research for a think tank called Canadian Policy Research Networks, and ran research and policy for ACTRA, a trade union for workers in film, television and radio. She was a Toronto District School Board trustee in 2014, then became president of the federal NDP party in 2016, and in 2018 took Davenport, a central Toronto riding, from the Liberals. She was acclaimed leader of the Ontario NDP in 2023. She has two grown daughters with Jordan Berger, an investment adviser who has also been involved in NDP politics. Now contesting her first election as leader, she presents as a politician in the mould of her predecessor Andrea Horwath, whose personal popularity in the 2022 election was higher among the general public than any of her rival party leaders for similar reasons and impressions. The danger for Stiles, then, is that she goes the way of Horwath and resigns after failing to translate that personal popularity into local candidate votes, even perhaps losing Official Opposition status. The going has been tough against a Progressive Conservative majority and an Ontario Liberal Party getting back on its feet, moving to the centre, and squeezing the government. Within her party, a key early challenge for Stiles was in the renegade MPP Sarah Jama who refused Stiles' request to apologize and retract a one-sided and inflammatory statement about Israel after the Hamas atrocity of Oct. 7, 2023. That led Stiles to kick her out of the party for insubordination and making work environments unsafe for staff, after which Stiles' own constituency office was vandalized with red paint and signs saying ""blood on your hands"" and ""Free Palestine."" ""I think it caused some problems for her,"" Goodyear-Grant said. There was internal support, but there were also internal calls for Stiles' resignation. ""Any attempt by a leader to usurp local autonomy is never taken well."" To take this election, Stiles will need her own base, plus the votes parked with her party since the collapse of the Liberal Party under Kathleen Wynne, and then some. That means flipping Progressive Conservative voters who see grounds to reject Doug Ford, for example over the scandal involving alleged insider dealing in property development on protected Greenbelt land, which claimed the resignations of two cabinet ministers, and is still under RCMP investigation. (Ford's government is co-operating with the investigation and denies any criminality.) Such a scandal could be a winner for a left-wing campaigner against a long-term Tory incumbent. But Stiles has struggled to command the attention she needs to drive that message, not least because of bigger fears about trade war with America, but also because Ford's Progressive Conservatives have waged their fiercest offence against the Ontario Liberal Party leader. ""Which is weird,"" said Goodyear-Grant. ""It's weird because the New Democrats are the Official Opposition and have been for a while."" The NDP are the government in waiting now, Goodyear-Grant said. The challenge for Stiles is to end that long wait.","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.","Brean, Joseph",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 15, 2025",Scandals; Voters; Labor unions; Elections; Political parties,Nom: Carleton University; NAICS: 611310,2025-02-15,The Ottawa Citizen
"Rivals take aim at Tories in debate:   Liberal leader splits with prior premiers as Green, NDP heads attack Ford in north-focused event",2025,"Bonnie Crombie tried to distance herself from previous Liberal governments in the first leaders' debate of the Feb. 27 election campaign, prompting Doug Ford to growl ""what a joke."" In a testy exchange, the Liberal leader said she disagrees with some moves by Liberal premiers Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne during the 15 years they were in power - a span that ended with a 2018 win by Ford's Progressive Conservatives. ""As you know, I'm a new Liberal leader and I'm not taking responsibility for decisions made previously,"" Crombie said during a 90-minute debate on northern issues Friday at Canadore College in North Bay. New Democrat Leader Marit Stiles and Green Leader Mike Schreiner also took shots at Ford in a bid to narrow his comfortable lead in public opinion polls with less than two weeks until voting day. ""After seven years of Doug Ford, we've had a lot of talk but it's never been worse,"" said Stiles, speaking about a housing shortage and high housing prices, a doctor shortage, worsening hallway health care in overcrowded hospitals and growing homelessness and encampments. ""Where are the homes, Doug?"" she said. ""There's a whole generation of young people who cannot even imagine buying a home and can't even afford an affordable rental home."" ""He said he would end hallway health care,"" Schreiner added. ""Seven years later, it's twice as worse."" Ford said voters should make their ballot decision on which leader is best positioned to stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump and his threatened tariffs that could ravage Ontario's trade-dependent economy. ""This election is about who's going to protect the people of Ontario,"" said Ford, who was in Washington this week to lobby U.S. lawmakers. He stuck to his campaign script, urging voters to give him ""a strong, stable four-year mandate"" to outlast Trump. On her differences with previous Liberal governments, Crombie cited the cancellation a decade ago of the Northlander train connecting northern residents from Cochrane and points south to Toronto. Ford has promised to restore it, but service has not yet resumed despite a plan to purchase new trains and a pledge to have them running by mid-decade. ""I support the Northlander. It should never have been closed,"" Crombie said. Ford warned opposition parties would ""tax the people to death"" and said Crombie raised taxes annually during the almost 10 years she was mayor of Mississauga, causing some residents to leave. After the debate, opposition leaders took Ford to task over his off-the-cuff remarks at a police chief's gala in London two weeks ago that home-invasion killers should be sent ""right to sparky"" - a reference to the electric chair. Ford's campaign scrambled to walk back the remarks after they were first reported in the Star, saying they were made in ""poor taste"" and insisted Ford does not support a return to capital punishment, abolished in 1976. ""We need a premier who's not going to make jokes about the death penalty,"" Schreiner said as reporters scrummed the leaders for their thoughts on the debate. Ford left without taking questions. The capital punishment quip was ""disgusting and inappropriate,"" said Stiles. Crombie said Ford has been unmasked again, as he was in hot mic comments last week about supporting Trump to win the U.S. election. The leaders go head-to-head live on television on Monday at 6:30 p.m. in Toronto.

Liberals and NDP a candidate short:   Tough talk on trade and health care on campaign trail,2025,"Health care was front and centre on the campaign trail this week, as Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford took a trip to Washington on a tariff-fighting mission - and, upon returning to Ontario, had to explain a ""poor-taste joke"" he made about capital punishment. On Friday, all four party leaders were in North Bay for their first debate. On Monday, they will be in Toronto for their second, and last, before the Feb. 27 vote. Here are the top takeaways: On the campaign trail The PCs and Greens are running candidates in all 124 provincial ridings, while the Liberals and NDP each unexpectedly ended up one short just before nominations closed. In Eglinton-Lawrence, the NDP candidate bowed out, saying she didn't want to split votes on the political left, and would instead be supporting Liberal Vince Gasparro. In Windsor West, the Liberals aren't running anyone against incumbent NDP candidate Lisa Gretzky, telling the Star it's ""too bad Moe Chehab isn't running"" - the candidate the party wanted to field - but the Liberals otherwise ""have a strong slate of candidates across the province."" The time wasn't right for the Liberals on Monday, when Leader Bonnie Crombie unexpectedly started her announcement half an hour early in Toronto, as reporters were still en route from an earlier news conference with the NDP. Ford also had a tough time Monday, struggling to find the right words when asked about whale deaths at Marineland. ""It's terrible of any animal dying in those, whales,"" he said. ""You know, it'd be great just to let them free, but what I understand, if you let them free in the ocean, they're done. They're dead. So we're going to make sure that they still take care of these whales."" The NDP is asking the province's integrity commissioner to investigate whether Ford broke ethics rules in a social media ad posted on his feed with him in Washington that also featured the ""Protect Ontario"" slogan. The ad was removed and reposted soon after with no PC logos. Campaign promises The PCs pledged to ban Chinese components and equity in all government energy, critical mineral or infrastructure projects. The NDP wants to legislate nurse-patient ratios, and hire 15,000 nurses over three years. Its northern strategy promised 911 in all communities, 350 new doctors and more spaces at the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, as well as home and long-term care for First Nations and Francophone patients in their language. The Liberals pledged to create 40,000 paid internships for students, get rid of interest on Ontario Student Assistance Program loans and cap international student enrolment while boosting funding for colleges and universities. On Wednesday, they pledged to pay nurses and personal support workers a ""living wage"" whether they work in hospitals, home care or long-term care. The Greens revealed their full platform on Wednesday, which included waiving the land transfer tax for first-time homebuyers and cutting taxes for those earning less than $65,000 or households earning less than $100,000. To help with home energy costs, the Greens would provide free heat pumps for households with income of less than $100,000 and interest-free loans for those above that. They would create an ""Ontario Foodbelt"" to preserve farmland, and also protect the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Echoing the other parties' promises, they also want to hire 3,500 new doctors in the next four years, including 350 for northern Ontario. In their own words NDP Leader Marit Stiles on tariffs and Ford calling the U.S. a ""customer"": ""I think Ontarians are looking for a strong pushback and a fight for every single job and every single worker. In this case, I would say the customer is not always right, Doug. In fact, sometimes the customer needs to stand outside for a few minutes."" Bonnie Crombie on the election: ""It's Ford against Crombie in this race, and I'm happy to challenge him anytime on his turf - or on mine. And my turf is the gym, so if he wants to come at me and we'll have a competition in the gym, and maybe we'll do push ups. What do you think?"" Crombie also said a Liberal government would help businesses with access to loans, creating ""what we call the Fight Tariff Fund, the FTF - or F-Trump Fund too - however you want to take it."" Ford was forced to walk back comments he made to a law enforcement crowd Jan. 29 about those who commit violent home invasions. ""God forbid they kill an innocent person. I don't even go 25 years. I send 'em right to sparky and then we'll take everything from there,"" using slang for the electric chair. His team later said Ford made a ""poor-taste joke out of frustration"" and ""does not support capital punishment but rather firmly believes more needs to be done to keep violent and repeat offenders behind bars where they belong.""

""The Ontario PCs are the only party with a plan to protect Ontario, and as your next MPP for Eglinton-Lawrence, I'm ready to be a strong voice for our community."" Since 2018, the riding has been held by the PC MPP Robin Martin, despite being held by the Liberals for nearly two decades before that. Martin announced her intention to step down in early November Cooper, who secured the PC nomination in December, previously served as executive director of the Ontario PC Party Fund. FILE: MPP Robin Martin speaks during a press conference on Friday, February 9, 2024 in Windsor. The Eglinton-Lawrence riding remained sharply contested in the 2022 election, with Martin besting the Liberal opponent by only a few hundred votes and a margin of less than two per cent. Doyle-Merrick had run for the NDP then but came in a distant third, with less than 10 per cent of the vote, while the PCs and Liberals each took over 40 per cent. ""This election is crucial because the past seven years Doug Ford and the Ontario Conservatives have been absent and ineffective, showing zero interest in delivering the support ALL residents in Eglinton-Lawrence need to thrive,"" she added, without explicitly naming either the Liberal candidate Vince Gasparro or the PC candidate. I recognize the race in Eglinton-Lawrence is a clear two-party contest between Liberals and Conservatives.

"Prop up Saskatchewan's steel industry, NDP says; Province needs to take action after tariffs from U.S. President Trump",2025,"S A S K AT O O N Saskatchewan New Democratic Party Leader Carla Beck called for the provincial government to take some direct action to counteract the impact of American tariffs on the province's steel industry. Beck held a news conference on Wednesday at Supreme Steel, north of Saskatoon in the Rural Municipality of Corman Park, calling for the government to prioritize Saskatchewan companies when awarding contracts for public projects. ""We need to be looking at how we can expand domestic production, creating more jobs, more products here at home,"" she said. The NDP's critic for SaskBuilds, Erika Ritchie, echoed Beck's message. The MLA for Saskatoon Nutana said the government needs to take the lead in the current climate by prioritizing provincial producers. ""We've seen too many Saskatchewan government contracts go to American companies over Saskatchewan companies,"" she said. Since American tariffs have reemerged, there have been calls from many quarters to do away with regulations that inhibit interprovincial trade; this sentiment has also been echoed by Premier Scott Moe. Beck said what the NDP is calling for does not conflict with efforts to increase interprovincial trade, noting other provinces have taken similar actions that do not conflict with existing interprovincial trade agreements. ""This is about getting best value for Saskatchewan tax dollars when we're looking at public procure- ment,"" she said. Beck said there also needs to be a focus on finding alternative markets and developing trade infrastructure. The most recent numbers showed Saskatchewan exports almost $400 million worth of steel to the U.S. annually. The future is uncertain, which means the government should be doing everything in its power to counteract any negative impacts, she said. ""We don't know what's coming."" David Fritz, president of Supreme Steel, said the company dealt with fallout from tariffs during the first Trump administration, but this new round of tariffs is different and could prove more challenging. ""They seemed to be more broad, the tariffs this time, more encompassing;(Trump) appears to be allowing for less exemptions and exclusions,"" he said. Supreme Steel in Saskatchewan employs around 100 people and usually relies on U.S. customers for 10 per cent of its revenues, he said, adding that the number can fluctuate due to a range of factors. Fritz said the company's American purchasers will likely re-evaluate buying from Canadian companies. The historically stronger American dollar has incentivized U.S.-based companies to purchase Canadian steel as the exchange rate saved them money, but the recent tariffs will change this. ""Now with a tariff, especially as high as 50 per cent, it would no longer make it viable to buy that fabricated product from Saskatchewan and Canada,"" he said. Fritz said Supreme Steel will be looking for new customers and could also be affected if counter-tariffs are imposed on American companies shipping steel in to Canada, since Supreme sources steel from the U.S. ""We've been really successful finding work domestically, so that'd be where we shift our focus,"" he said.","Leader Post; Regina, Sask.","Regina, Sask.","Joel-hansen, Michael",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 14, 2025",Steel industry; American dollar; Interprovincial trade; Tariffs,,2025-02-14,Leader Post
Eby's grocery rebate not coming; NDP doubles down on hiring pause that has a long list of exceptions,2025,"Finance Minister Brenda Bailey summoned reporters to her office at the legislature on Thursday for an update on the provincial budget she'll be presenting next month. The biggest news was the fate of the ""grocery rebate"" of $1,000 per family, $500 for individuals, that was the centrepiece of the NDP's platform in the provincial election. ""It will not be in the budget,"" said Bailey, confirming what she and Premier David Eby had been hinting since late last year. ""It is no longer the right time to make a new big expenditure,"" Bailey told reporters. But was it ever the right time for a promise costed at $1.8 billion from the outset? The rebate was injected into the election platform in a bid to hang on to power against the surging B.C. Conservative Oppo- sition. The New Democrats won, but only just. Bailey, appointed finance minister in the postelection cabinet, inherited responsibility for implementing the rebate. It made an awkward fit for a finance minister who declared one of her first priorities would be to develop a plan to bring the provincial budget back into balance and phase out a deficit then estimated at $9.4 billion. But first they'll take another $1.8 billion hit to the bottom line? Very funny, minister. Not that Bailey admitted, in shelving the rebate Thursday, that a government with any sense of fiscal responsibility would ever have made such a promise in the first place. Instead, she blamed the broken promise entirely on Donald Trump. ""The time that this commitment was made was a very different time than the world after Nov. 25. (when) then president-elect Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on their closest trading partner."" While the rebate has been declared unaffordable for now, the New Democrats are still looking at a middle-class income tax cut. So maybe next year. Trump permitting. The second bit of news was what the New Democrats are characterizing as a ""bold"" expansion of the ""hiring freeze"" that Eby and Bailey announced last December. The NDP's preferred terminology is a ""pause,"" not a ""freeze."" Either way, there's not a lot of significance in terms of measurable outcomes. She announced neither jobs numbers nor cost savings. The latest exercise applies only to central government and its ministries. It does not extend to health care, schools, universities and the like. Bailey hedged when I asked how the pause/freeze would be monitored and enforced. Was the government imposing a cap on the size of its own public service for example? Nope, no cap. Rather the exercise would be enforced on a case-by-case basis and subject to exemptions. That tells a lot. When the premier announced the first so-called freeze last year, the New Democrats had already authorized the addition of 1,600 full-time positions in the first six months of the year. This latest freeze - OK, pause - could allow further increases in the size of the public service because the exemptions are broad and undefined. The main exemptions are positions designated as ""clearly essential to delivering core government programs and services."" Pressed for examples, Bailey mentioned social workers and corrections officers, as opposed to those not on the front line delivering services. But the finance minister really gave the NDP's game away when she was asked about political staffers. The government is top heavy with appointees with NDP and trade union connections, many of them more handsomely paid than public servants. Those positions would be subject to review as well, said Bailey. Then she gave the example of a chief of staff to a cabinet minister, the official title for a political handler reporting directly to the political masters in the premier's office. If a minister needed a chief of staff, the position would be filled, said Bailey. But of course: How else would the premier keep the minister on a short leash? In short, it looks to be business as usual for a party that expanded the public service by more than a third in its first seven years in office. One thing the finance minister won't do is delay the budget any longer than the New Democrats have already done. The date is still March 4, two weeks later than usual and, as Bailey acknowledged, smack dab in the middle of Trump's next deadline for the 25 per cent tariffs. The timing makes it ""impossible"" to gauge the impact of whatever Trump will or will not do. The Finance Ministry is making up a budget on the basis of ""hoping for the best and preparing for the worst."" She says they actually considered drawing up two budgets, one for each scenario. But in the end, they concluded to simply proceed, leaving enough leeway in terms of contingency funds to cover the unexpected. ""We will have to make some very difficult decisions,"" said Bailey. Perhaps she and her colleagues will make some tough calls in the budget they present early next month. But Thursday's announcements - a dubious hiring freeze, scrapping a reckless promise that should never have been made in the first place - don't strike me as especially difficult. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 14, 2025",Provincial budget; Hiring; Politics; Tariffs,,2025-02-14,The Vancouver Sun

Carney won't rule out calling early election:   NDP members told to expect snap vote if Liberal leadership candidate wins contest,2025,"Liberal leadership contender Mark Carneyis not ruling out calling an early election if he wins the party's leadership and replaces Justin Trudeau as prime minister on March 9. At the same time, the Liberal party says it has told its organizers to set up campaign offices next month, when the Liberals choose their new leader and the minority government faces election-hungry opposition parties with the return of Parliament. At a press conference in Vancouver on Thursday, Carney said that as Liberal leader he ""will do"" what is best for the country as it faces punishing trade tariffs from the United States. That could mean recalling Parliament or calling an early election, he said. ""If Parliament needs to be recalled for certain reasons, it will be,"" Carney said Thursday. ""If it makes sense to get a strong mandate at that point, that is what will follow."" As it stands, Parliament is set to return on March 24, after Trudeau suspended the session with a prorogation when he announced his intention to resign as prime minister on Jan. 6. All three main opposition parties - the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and New Democrats - have said they want an election and would vote down the Liberal minority government as soon as possible. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, however, has also said the government should speak to opposition parties about a possible relief package for Canadian workers who could face job losses in a trade war with the U.S. But the NDP is also gearing up for a snap election that they expect Carney to call if he wins the Liberal leadership. In an internal memo sent Wednesday to candidates and staff, the New Democrats' national campaign director urged party members to prepare for an election call as early as March 10, one day after Trudeau's successor is chosen. ""It is becoming more and more likely that Mark Carney will be the next Liberal leader on March 9,"" Jennifer Howard says in the memo obtained by the Star. ""If Mark Carney does win the leadership, we are hearing from many Ottawa sources that he intends on calling an election shortly after becoming Liberal leader."" Other leadership campaigns, with candidates who - unlike Carney - currently have seats in the House of Commons, were explicit about trying to work in the minority Parliament. ""As a sitting member of Parliament, Chrystia Freeland is ready to work with Parliament and all political parties to fight Donald Trump and to fight for Canada,"" said Freeland's spokesperson Katherine Cuplinskas. Responding by email, a spokesperson for the Karina Gould campaign said they don't believe Canadians want an election right now. ""We're focused on fighting for Canadians interests and ensuring Parliament works to support Canadians and pass critical legislation,"" said spokesperson Emily Jackson. ""We hope the other parties will be able to come together to keep Parliament functioning and not play politics."" Former MP Frank Baylis's campaign, meanwhile, has said he would not call an early election. Two Liberal MPs confirmed to the Star on Thursday that the party has asked organizers to get ready for a coming general election campaign, though neither of them found the message unusual, given the overall political situation. ""The party is recommending that candidates start to look for campaign offices, get ready for an election,"" said one MP, who spoke about internal party matters on condition of anonymity. In an emailed statement to the Star, Liberal spokesperson Parker Lund confirmed the party wants campaign teams to be ready with offices ""in March,"" when the House is set to return. Alleging Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre ""can't be trusted to stand up for Canadians against Trump,"" Lund said ""the Liberal Party of Canada is ready to fight and win the next election, whenever it may arise."" The Liberals currently have candidates nominated in 146 of the 343 ridings where Canadians will vote in the next election. In the NDP memo, which was first reported by the Globe and Mail, Howard reiterates the NDP's position that Parliament be recalled to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats, but says no Liberal leadership contestant has reached out to opposition leaders about passing legislation in Parliament that deals with Trump. ""On that basis, we believe the rumours of Mr. Carney calling a snap election are credible. Taking a page from Doug Ford's playbook, the Liberals believe that they can turn this crisis into a political benefit for them,"" Howard said. ""For that reason, I am asking all campaigns to be prepared for an election call to come as early as March 10th."" The NDP says it has about 140 candidates nominated so far. Vandana Kattar, a Liberal strategist who worked in Trudeau's office for more than five years, said she doesn't think Carney would call an immediate election if he is elected as Liberal leader. She said she would expect the former central banker, who has no experience in electoral politics, to want to take some time to understand the Liberal party political apparatus, get briefed by government officials and deal with Trump's tariff threats. She said it also makes sense the NDP is trying to prepare its staff in an effort to motivate them, since she sees Carney bringing momentum to the Liberals. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have been targeting Carney for criticism, describing the current government as the ""Carney-Trudeau"" Liberals. They've alleged that, while in the private sector, Carney supported construction of fossil fuel pipelines in other countries, despite agreeing with the government's 2016 decision to reject the Northern Gateway pipeline through northern British Columbia. And they contend the former central banker - who has previously espoused support for carbon pricing - can't be trusted when he says he will ditch the Trudeau government's consumer carbon price-and-rebate system and replace it with a scheme of industry-paid green incentives. On Thursday, the Conservatives accused Carney of downplaying opioid overdoses in Canada after he referred to fentanyl as a ""challenge"" in Canada as opposed to a ""crisis"" in the U.S. Trump has criticized Canada for allowing fentanyl to cross the border, and has used that to justify the threat of tariffs, even though less than one per cent of fentanyl intercepted by U.S. border agents comes through the Canadian border. Sarah Fischer, a spokesperson for the Conservative party, said the Tories will be ready with ""a full slate of candidates and a full bank account"" whenever the next election happens.

Abolish road tolls. Is the war on the car over? Opinion, Feb. 3 Recent pledges by party leaders around transportation and relieving gridlock range from the absurd to the myopic. PC Leader Doug Ford is promoting his pet GTA tunnel - price be damned - and talking about removing tolls from the publicly owned portion of Highway 407. Yet, he still won't tell us what the destructive Highway 413 will cost. NDP leader Marit Stiles' pledge to remove all tolls on the 407 is also ill-conceived. Those plans will cost a lot of money for benefits that will be short-lived when induced demand inevitably leads to more congestion within a few years. There are many better ways to reduce gridlock - including truck accommodation on the 407, targeted existing highway expansion and, of course, major transit expansion (much of which has been proposed in recent years). The $100 billion and 20 years that building a vanity tunnel will likely need could be used to create a world-class mass transit system. That's a far more attractive image to envision. Richard Schertzer, Milton Doug Ford has been a disaster for Ontario Doug Ford wants to protect us from Donald Trump. But who will protect us from Doug Ford? Opinion, Feb. 5 Are Ontarians better off than we were seven years ago? The answer is no. Just follow the money and the deals and policies to get a sense how badly Ontario has fared under the Ford government. Ford spent big dollars to buy out Brewers Retail early, sent $200 cheques to everyone, entered bad deals with a spa company for Ontario Place, spent millions on self-promotional advertising, planned to build a tunnel under Highway 401, cancelled the cap and trade, which triggered the federal carbon tax, and created the Greenbelt/developer friends fiasco, all while neglecting Ontario's infrastructure, health-care system and education system. Gary Johnson, Stouffville Trump backers will pay the price for his tariffs Donald Trump hits Canadian aluminum and steel with 25 per cent tariff, Feb. 10 Once again the president of the U.S. has shown a lack of understanding of the impacts of his impulsive actions. He is still trying to gaslight his followers into thinking tariffs will be paid by the supplying country. Wrong. U.S. companies that import goods from Canada pay the tariffs. They are collected by the U.S. government and, as Donald Trump has said, will be used to bring down the tax rate on his billionaire bros. The cost of everything imported under a tariff will get more expensive and be passed on to the American consumer. If you look at the goods being exchanged across the border, it gets more interesting. The ones coming from the U.S. to Canada are generally completed products. In contrast, most of the exports to the U.S. are raw materials - oil, wood, aluminum, steel and energy - that supply the creation of their exports. So ""tit-for-tat"" tariff wars are a loser for the U.S., and a bigger loss for Trump's supporters. Tom McElroy, Toronto Let's build a made-in-Canada electric vehicle A few years ago, the Automotive Parts Manufacturing Association built Project Arrow, an electric vehicle with 100 per cent Canadian parts. It bothered me then and bothers me more now that it was just for demonstration purposes, rather than setting up an assembly line to build them. This was when the provincial and federal governments were giving billions of dollars to automakers for EV manufacturing. Canada needs a 100 per cent Canadian-built electric car. We need it to get out from under the Trump tariffs and to offer an affordable alternative to the overpriced vehicles now on the market. Canadians are now holding onto their vehicles an average of 10 years. Why? Who can afford new vehicles that average more than $60,000? New and used cars have increased in price by about 40 per cent since pre-pandemic days. Build a mid-sized Canadian EV for less than $40,000 or a small EV for less than $30,000. And bring back the EV incentives. Judy Smith, Cobourg Make beer cans in Canada According to a CBC report (featuring one of our best microbreweries Great Lakes Brewery) Canada sends aluminum to the U.S. to be turned into beer cans, and Canadian breweries buy them back. I cannot believe we don't make our own beer cans. Microbreweries are greatly concerned about tariffs affecting both ends of beer can production. I'm from Guelph, home to a major brewery and four excellent microbreweries. Guelph is also home to Linamar, a maker of auto parts that is greatly concerned about potential tariffs. Perhaps Linamar should retool a plant and make some beer cans. This would keep some manufacturing jobs, keep production costs for Canadian brewers down, and keep prices for beer drinkers down too. Aaron Duncan, Guelph Garbage trucks need big windows The windows in garbage trucks are so high and so tiny the drivers cannot see people beneath them. I was side-swiped by a garbage truck a few years back and the driver didn't even see my car. When I spoke to the driver (fortunately I was not hurt), the window was so far above my head it was difficult to communicate. I am not alone. Similar incidents, some fatal, occur in Toronto frequently. I cannot think of any good reason why the people inside the truck need such high tiny windows. It is most probably a cost-cutting measure, but is costing lives. The design definitely needs a rethink or a reworking. Karen Quinton, Etobicoke Newfoundland tourism ads are mesmerizing Newfoundland and Labrador takes the cake for early tourism promotion. They are the first province to promote in January of each year and it is always mesmerizing. I have been there twice and look forward to going again. No other province or territory comes close.

Ontario NDP files ethics complaint over Ford’s Washington trip,2025,"Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles is asking the province’s Integrity Commissioner to investigate Doug Ford’s trip to Washington this week, accusing the Progressive Conservative Leader of using the visit for partisan purposes during the provincial election campaign. Mr. Ford was in Washington alongside his fellow premiers to meet with American lawmakers in a bid to prevent U.S. President Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs. Mr. Ford was travelling in his capacity as premier and chair of the Council of the Federation, the group that represents the 13 provincial and territorial leaders. The visit culminated Wednesday in a meeting with two senior White House officials – deputy chief of staff James Blair and Sergio Gor, director of the Presidential Personnel Office – which the premiers described as frank and constructive. B.C. Premier David Eby also said the premiers made it clear that Canada would never become the 51st state, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested. However, Mr. Blair later posted on social-media site X that the two officials “never agreed that Canada would not be the 51st state,” but that they would share Mr. Eby’s comments. On Thursday, Mr. Ford’s X account posted a video with footage from his trip to Washington that ended with the PC party logo and slogan “Protect Ontario.” The video was later taken down and reposted without the campaign branding. In a letter sent to Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake on Thursday, Ms. Stiles said Mr. Ford’s video promotes “a clearly partisan political message encouraging Ontarians to vote for the PC Party.” She also suggested Mr. Ford violated the “caretaker” convention on the trip, which generally restricts government business to urgent matters during the writ period. Ontarians go to the polls Feb. 27. “I am asking that you review the activities of this trip to Washington to determine if taxpayer dollars were put to use in service of the personal or partisan gain of Doug Ford, and if the caretaker principles were violated,” Ms. Stiles wrote. Michelle Renaud, a spokesperson for the office of the Integrity Commissioner, said the office’s “general position” is that trade disputes and the imposition of tariffs “constitute an urgent matter in the public interest” and that attending events “related to this issue can be undertaken by members of cabinet, provided that the activities are not then used for partisan purposes.” Ms. Stiles also said she would be complaining to Elections Ontario. Speaking to reporters in Sudbury on Thursday, Ms. Stiles said the fact that Mr. Ford took down his video and reposted it is a “sure sign of guilt.” “The Integrity Commissioner has been very clear about this, they were not to use that event for partisan purposes. He turned around and did it right away,” she said. Ivana Yelich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ford’s campaign, defended the video. “Footage of the Premier being the Premier is routinely used in political social content,” she said in a statement. “However, out of an abundance of caution, the video was reposted without campaign branding.” Ms. Yelich also said previously that the PC party paid for Mr. Ford’s travel to Washington, as well as for the political staff accompanying him, including the use of a private charter plane. Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie on Thursday also criticized Mr. Ford for playing “fast and loose with the rules” and said the visit was “not very successful.” “This looks like a photo-op opportunity. I can go stand over at the White House and get my picture done as well,” Ms. Crombie told reporters at a campaign stop in Elmvale, Ont. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew, who was among the 11 premiers in the White House meeting, told reporters Thursday that it was an important part of relationshipbuilding with Trump officials. “Keeping things at a high level, I can tell you, in this meeting, I talked about energy, our baseload power, hydro and electricity exports that we have in Manitoba that are such a great economic driver that we have. I touched on agriculture, I touched on the jobs,” Mr. Kinew said. He also said he met with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, and had a “brief conversation” with Trump ally and tech mogul Elon Musk. “We didn’t really have a scheduled meeting with him,” Mr. Kinew said of the Musk encounter. “It was just a few of my colleagues and I bumped into him while we were at the White House.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Stone, Laura; Durrani, Temur",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 14, 2025",Political campaigns; Tariffs,,2025-02-14,The Globe and Mail
NDP asking integrity commissioner to investigate Ford video of trip to Washington,2025,"TORONTO - Ontario's NDP and Liberal party leaders cried foul Thursday over a trip Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford took to Washington, D.C., in the middle of a snap election he called, saying he's touting that visit for partisan purposes. NDP Leader Marit Stiles wrote to the province's integrity commissioner to ask him to look into the trip, including a campaign-style video Ford's team produced using clips from the jaunt. ""In my view, his actions have repeatedly and intentionally blurred the lines between partisan campaigning and official provincial business,"" Stiles wrote in the complaint. ""This demands transparency and accountability."" Ford and Canada's other premiers travelled to Washington this week to push back against U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods. The Progressive Conservatives have said the party paid travel expenses for Ford and campaign staff. Ford made the trip as premier, but he is also in the midst of campaigning in a snap provincial election that he called. Ahead of the trip, integrity commissioner J. David Wake wrote that it would not violate the caretaker convention - a principle that during an election the only government business that should continue is in a few instances, including routine matters or those that are urgent and in the public interest. Wake wrote that, in the context of current U.S.-Canada political relations, the trip met the urgent and public interest criteria. However, he said that such work was appropriate ""provided that the activities are not then used for partisan purposes."" Upon Ford's return to Ontario, his social media accounts posted a video showing clips of him in Washington that ended with the Progressive Conservative party logo. It was taken down and reposted without the logo shortly after Stiles said she would raise it with the integrity commissioner. Stiles suggested she still viewed Ford as using the trip for partisan gain. ""I don't think anyone is fooled by that (removal of the logo), and I think it is a sure sign of guilt as well,"" she said at a campaign stop in Sudbury. ""I think that he knows, and they know, they did something wrong, and yet that never seems to stop them."" Stiles asked the commissioner to look into how the footage of the non-partisan trip was distributed to the PC party for a campaign video, whether PC party staff accompanied civil servants on the trip, and if the agenda of the trip was acting in the public interest or optimizing the visit for the benefit of the election campaign. Stiles was announcing her northern platform ahead of the leaders meeting Friday for a northern-focused debate in North Bay. The NDP is promising more doctors and affordable homes for the north, as well as widening highways and strengthening truck driver training. A spokesperson for Ford described the video as ""footage of the premier being the premier"" and said those types of clips were routinely used in political social media content. Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said the trip was not appropriate in the middle of an election. ""Why isn't his focus the people of Ontario and protecting us all of the time, not just some of the time when it's convenient for him?"" she said at a campaign stop in the Barrie area.\ ""The only job he's gone there to protect is his own. Clearly, that's why he's called an early and unnecessary and expensive election in Ontario.""

NDP shoots the messenger on opioid diversion; Province played down ample evidence safer-supply drugs were being peddled,2025,"The New Democrats were put on the defensive last year by mounting evidence that government-approved safer supply drugs were being diverted to the illicit market. ""More B.C. detachments report having seized suspected safe supply drugs,"" read a March 2024 headline in the Northern Beat online news service, summarizing evidence from the RCMP in Prince George, Campbell River and Nanaimo. Reporter Fran Yanor later expanded the list to five detachments after she herself witnessed drug transactions outside pharmacies in Victoria and Duncan. The shocking details of what was happening emerged from a search warrant obtained by reporter Jason Proctor of the CBC. He disclosed how Prince George RCMP spent 10 days in March ""mounting a surveillance operation on a woman who stood outside a downtown pharmacy each morning trading illicit drugs for safer supply medication. ""Police saw the 58-year-old suspect make dozens of hand-tohand transactions at the time, both buying and selling prescribed pills worth up to $20 a tablet on the street."" The pharmacy manager told the police that ""many of his patients are accosted by individuals outside the pharmacy in the mornings by people who are trying to purchase safe supply drugs."" With recipients being dispensed as many as 28 pills in one visit, that would equate ""to $440 to $480 a day if resold."" But just as the police were opening up about the extent of the problem, that line of communication was interrupted. On March 11, an RCMP memo directed all detachments to reroute all communications through headquarters on ""hot button"" issues, including drug seizures, decriminalization and the like. Detachments were warned against speaking publicly about ""controversial or high-profile topics ... in the pre-election time period."" The memo, which Yanor obtained after the fact, proved to be a gag order. RCMP detachments now routed her questions through headquarters. Other journalists - Tristin Hopper and Adam Zivo of Postmedia, Paul Johnson of Global TV and Andrea Woo of the Globe and Mail - reported on aspects of diversion, including the questionable involvement of some pharmacies. The illicit trade had been predicted from the outset of the experiment in dispensing safer supply drugs without supervision. ""As long as (government) gives valuable things away for free, or far below market prices, one should expect there to also be profiteers wishing to profit by obtaining supply for resale,"" warned U.S. drug policy expert Jonathan Caulkins. But each bit of evidence of diversion ran into a stonewall of denials and evasions from cabinet ministers Mike Farnworth (public safety) and Jennifer Whiteside (mental health and addictions) and from public health officials wedded to the ideology of decriminalization and safer supply. The news reports were dismissed as anecdotal and isolated. The ministers claimed there was ""no evidence of widespread diversion."" The drugs that were seized were not necessarily dispensed through the safer supply program. And in any event, they were safer for consumption than the poisoned supply that was killing a half dozen people a day. Pushing back was Opposition MLA Elenore Sturko, a former RCMP officer. She cited evidence that the diverted safer supply drugs were ending up with a new generation of users and that organized crime was profiting from the trade. She said that if the government lacked evidence of widespread diversion, it was only because the New Democrats had not asked police to compile and report data on that score. You'd think that would have been a starting point in judging what was billed as an experiment. Instead NDP policy was ""don't ask, don't tell."" Then last week Sturko released a leaked copy of a confidential briefing document from the Ministry of Health. It had been circulated to police and other officials, detailing an investigation that began in confidence last June. ""A significant portion of the opioids being freely prescribed by doctors and pharmacists are not being consumed by their intended recipients,"" it con - firmed. ""Prescribed alternatives are trafficked provincially, nationally and internationally."" With those few words, the NDP's strategy of denial and evasion collapsed. Yet rather than acknowledge the coverup, Health Minister Josie Osborne blasted Sturko for leaking ""a confidential document"" that could compromise a continuing investigation. Sturko set the record straight on that score as well. ""If this had been truly sensitive information that would have jeopardized an investigation, it would not have been put into a PowerPoint and then presented to many, many public servants and officers across the province,"" she told the CBC's Gloria Macarenko. ""I actually confirmed that this will not impact ongoing investigations ... with sources that would know whether or not this would jeopardize an investigation. I was told 'no, it won't.'"" Still, Osborne sought credit for the government launching the investigation. ""We knew this was happening,"" she protested. ""There is absolutely no denial of it, there's no diminishing of it."" The New Democrats absolutely did deny and diminish the evidence of diversion, including through the provincial election. The only reason the public knew anything about the illicit trade was owing to intrepid news reporting and work by the Opposition. No wonder the NDP's final outrage was to condemn the leak that exposed the truth. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 13, 2025",Decriminalization; Evidence; Drug stores; Criminal investigations; Pharmacy; Search warrants,,2025-02-13,The Vancouver Sun

"HSC mortality ratio worst in Canada: data:   Union study also critical of Brandon General, Grace, St. B: NDP blamed for inaction",2025,"Winnipeg’s Health Sciences Centre has earned the dismal distinction of being the worst-performing hospital in Canada. The province’s largest hospital has the highest standardized mortality ratio in the country, <a href=""https://wfpquantum.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/2025/44517_MNU_White_Paper_Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">according to data from the Canadian Institute for Health Information</a>. That, and more, was revealed Wednesday in a report released by the Manitoba Nurses Union that charged “no measurable progress has been observed” in some facets of health care since the New Democratic Party took power in the fall of 2023. The 36-page report — dubbed the White Paper — takes aim at the provincial government, which took issue with the document and said it failed to account for ongoing system improvements or those already completed. Union president Darlene Jackson stood by the report’s findings, saying the data contained within “cannot be disputed. “I think this is a wake-up call for the public to say to government this is not acceptable,” Jackson told the Free Press . “Things are not rosy in health care, despite what’s been said. We are in a terrible crisis.” Using publicly available information and data obtained through freedom of information requests, the nursing union found the patient load of Winnipeg emergency departments and urgent-care centres has remained relatively consistent over the past five years. Wait times, however, have more than doubled, forcing one in seven patients to leave without receiving treatment, the report said. “These statistics point to deep systemic issues that are compromising patient care and safety across Manitoba’s public health-care system,” it said. CIHI’s standardized mortality ratio metric compares the mortality rates of hospitals nationwide, adjusting for factors such as age, sex, diagnoses, among others. The institute’s most recent analysis, completed last year, found the Grace, St. Boniface and Brandon General hospitals also ranked among the eight worst-performing facilities in Canada. “I feel terribly for the staff because I know how hard they work. I know that they are doing the best they can to provide amazing patient care, but circumstances have put them in this category, which is extremely sad,” Jackson said. “Our nurses tell us continuously that things are not getting better in health care, that, in fact, there are areas where things are deteriorating. Nurses are frustrated. We were promised a change.” Other data collected in the report showed nursing vacancy rates reached 21 per cent last summer, up from 16 per cent during the same period in 2020. While the union admitted those numbers may have since improved, the report said the vacancies were “adversely affecting patient safety and the quality of care” as nursing overtime hours surged from 800,000 in 2021 to more than 1.1 million in 2024. The province, in turn, spent $75 million on private-agency nurses to cover 1.2 million nursing hours last year, the report said, citing data it obtained from regional health authorities. The government announced last week it added 1,255 net new hires in hospitals across Manitoba, including 481 nurses. Approximately 60 people came out of retirement and more than 200 left the private sector for the public system, Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara said. “The concerns that are outlined in the White Paper are concerns that we have been taking very seriously, and we’ve taken action over these past 16 months to address,” Asagwara said. “In some cases, the issues have actually already been completely addressed.” Asagwara acknowledged there were challenges in health care, but said the government has made strides to bolster the system by listening to workers and investing in front-line care. The minister pointed to safety improvements on the HSC campus as one recent example. Asagwara has also directed health leaders to divert eight per cent of the dollars earmarked for corporate services to improve patient care before the end of the current fiscal year. The union called the approach “short-sighted” and said it undermines new graduate support and senior nurse retention. “(The) budget reduction ultimatum has effectively forced health authorities to cut costs rather than invest in proven retention strategies,” the report said. The document included a slate of recommendations for the provincial government. Several were quality-of-life improvements, including creating a centralized shift scheduling system and providing better support for float nurses. The province must also boost incentives to retain senior nurses, further improve facility safety measures, increase transparency by proactively releasing health-care metrics, invest in home-care nurses and address primary-care shortages by making better use of highly qualified nurse practitioners, the report said. The union is hosting a news conference Thursday to further discuss the data it uncovered while preparing the report, Jackson said. tyler.searle@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tyler Searle","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Searle, Tyler",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 13, 2025",Patient safety; Nursing; Health care; Mortality; Nurses,,2025-02-13,Winnipeg Free Press
NDP campaign leader urges party to prepare for snap election call,2025,"The NDP’s campaign director is putting candidates and campaign teams on alert to be ready for a federal election launch as soon as March 10, immediately after the governing Liberal Party chooses its next leader, according to an internal party memo obtained by The Globe and Mail. The memo from NDP national campaign director Jennifer Howard, sent out Wednesday afternoon and titled “election timing and planning,” said the party has nominated candidates in 140 of Canada’s 338 ridings. Parliament is currently prorogued until March 24 while the Liberal Party selects a new leader to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms. Howard said in the note that none of the federal leadership candidates have reached out to the NDP about a potential package of emergency legislation to respond to U.S. tariffs, leading the party to believe that the Liberals are planning to call an election before Parliament is scheduled to resume. “It is becoming more and more likely that Mark Carney will be the next Liberal leader on March 9th. If Mark Carney does win the leadership, we are hearing from many Ottawa sources that he intends on calling an election shortly after becoming Liberal leader,” Ms. Howard wrote, adding that the NDP views these rumours of a snap election as credible. Referencing the current Ontario election campaign, she wrote: “Taking a page from Doug Ford’s playbook, the Liberals believe that they can turn this crisis into a political benefit for them. For that reason, I am asking all campaigns to be prepared for an election call to come as early as March 10th.” Several public opinion polls have indicated that former central banker Mark Carney is the candidate with the highest level of support among the general public, followed by former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Mr. Carney also has the most endorsements from Liberal MPs and ministers. The Liberal Party announced late last month that nearly 400,000 people are signed up as registered Liberals and will be eligible to vote in the leadership race, provided they go through a verification process. Neither Mr. Trudeau nor his office has said when exactly he will resign as prime minister to allow the new Liberal leader to also take the reins of government. Should Mr. Carney win, it would be the first time that Canada has had a prime minister who is not also a member of Parliament since John Turner became Liberal prime minister in 1984, succeeding Mr. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau. In that case, Mr. Turner won the Liberal Party leadership on June 16, 1984, and became prime minister two weeks later. Rather than running in a by-election, he quickly dissolved Parliament in early July and ran as a candidate in a federal election called for September.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 13, 2025",Leadership; Candidates; Parliaments; Prime ministers; Elections,,2025-02-13,The Globe and Mail
Prop up Saskatchewan's steel industry in face of tariffs: NDP,2025,"Saskatchewan New Democratic Party Leader Carla Beck called for the provincial government to take some direct action to counteract the impact of American tariffs on the province's steel industry. Beck held a news conference on Wednesday at Supreme Steel, north of Saskatoon in the Rural Municipality of Corman Park, calling for the government to prioritize Saskatchewan companies when awarding contracts for public projects. ""We need to be looking at how we can expand domestic production, creating more jobs, more products here at home,"" she said. The NDP's critic for SaskBuilds, Erika Ritchie, echoed Beck's message. The MLA for Saskatoon Nutana said the government needs to take the lead in the current climate by prioritizing provincial producers. ""We've seen too many Saskatchewan government contracts go to American companies over Saskatchewan companies,"" she said. Since American tariffs have re-emerged, there have been calls from many quarters to do away with regulations that inhibit interprovincial trade; this sentiment has also been echoed by Premier Scott Moe. Beck said what the NDP is calling for does not conflict with efforts to increase interprovincial trade, noting other provinces have taken similar actions that do not conflict with existing interprovincial trade agreements. ""This is about getting best value for Saskatchewan tax dollars when we're looking at public procurement,"" she said. Beck said there also needs to be a focus on finding alternative markets and developing trade infrastructure. The most recent numbers showed Saskatchewan exports almost $400 million worth of steel to the U.S. annually. The future is uncertain, which means the government should be doing everything in its power to counteract any negative impacts, she said. ""We don't know what's coming."" David Fritz, president and chief operating officer at Supreme Steel, said the company dealt with fallout from tariffs during the first Trump administration, but this new round of tariffs is different and could prove more challenging. ""They seemed to be more broad, the tariffs this time, more encompassing; (Trump) appears to be allowing for less exemptions and exclusions,"" he said. Supreme Steel in Saskatchewan employs around 100 people and usually relies on U.S. customers for 10 per cent of its revenues, he said, adding that the number can fluctuate due to a range of factors. Fritz said the company's American purchasers will likely re-evaluate buying from Canadian companies. The historically stronger American dollar has incentivized U.S.-based companies to purchase Canadian steel as the exchange rate saved them money, but the recent tariffs will change this, he added.

NDP campaign director urges candidates to prepare for quick federal election call in internal memo:   Memo from NDP national campaign director Jennifer Howard says candidates and campaign teams should be ready for a federal election call as early as March 10th,2025,"The NDP’s campaign director is putting candidates and campaign teams on alert to be ready for a federal election launch as soon as March 10, immediately after the governing Liberal Party chooses its next leader, according to an internal party memo obtained by The Globe and Mail. The memo from NDP national campaign director Jennifer Howard, sent out Wednesday afternoon and titled ""election timing and planning,"" said the party has nominated candidates in 140 of Canada’s 338 ridings. Parliament is currently prorogued until March 24 while the Liberal Party selects a new leader to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms. Howard said in the note that none of the federal leadership candidates have reached out to the NDP about a potential package of emergency legislation to respond to U.S. tariffs, leading the party to believe that the Liberals are planning to call an election before Parliament is scheduled to resume. ""It is becoming more and more likely that Mark Carney will be the next Liberal leader on March 9th. If Mark Carney does win the leadership, we are hearing from many Ottawa sources that he intends on calling an election shortly after becoming Liberal leader,"" Ms. Howard wrote, adding that the NDP views these rumours of a snap election as credible. Referencing the current Ontario election campaign, she wrote: ""Taking a page from Doug Ford’s playbook, the Liberals believe that they can turn this crisis into a political benefit for them. For that reason, I am asking all campaigns to be prepared for an election call to come as early as March 10th."" Several public opinion polls have indicated that former central banker Mark Carney is the candidate with the highest level of support among the general public, followed by former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. Mr. Carney also has the most endorsements from Liberal MPs and ministers. The Liberal Party announced late last month that nearly 400,000 people are signed up as registered Liberals and will be eligible to vote in the leadership race, provided they go through a verification process. Neither Mr. Trudeau nor his office has said when exactly he will resign as prime minister to allow the new Liberal leader to also take the reins of government. Should Mr. Carney win, it would be the first time that Canada has had a prime minister who is not also a Member of Parliament since John Turner became Liberal prime minister in 1984, succeeding Mr. Trudeau’s father, Pierre Trudeau. In that case, Mr. Turner won the Liberal Party leadership on June 16, 1984, and became prime minister two weeks later. Rather than running in a by-election, he quickly dissolved Parliament in early July and ran as a candidate in a federal election called for September.

"Trump's tariff threat brings NDP government out of hiding; Eby turns activist, sometimes twice a day, to keep up with torrent from White House",2025,"Whatever else one might say about Donald Trump's hit job on Canada, it did inspire Premier David Eby to shake off the hesitation that followed his near loss in the provincial election. Eby initially vowed he would hit the ground running, postelection. Instead, what followed was a discouraging combination of evasion and indecision. Mandate letters for the new cabinet were held up while the New Democrats engaged in protracted negotiations for the support of the two Green MLAs. Ministers, with few exceptions, went to ground, their calendars vacant, their presence mostly undetectable. Even the usual message boxes were hard to obtain on the record, reporters found. The agenda for the re-elected NDP government duplicated the one Eby proclaimed on being sworn in as premier in 2022: housing affordability, public safety, access to health care and reducing the cost of living. Never mind that the government's proposed solutions to those problems were much the same as the ones proposed in a broadly uninspiring election platform. Never mind that the electorate was so unimpressed, it came close to handing government to an unproven collection of newbie B.C. Conservatives and ex-Liberals. All that changed as it became increasingly apparent that Trump was determined to whack Canada with punishingly high tariffs on exports to the U.S. Gone was the hesitation. In its place was an activist premier, commanding the public platform as a solo act - twice a day if necessary to keep up with the torrent of announcements from south of the border. Eby's new agenda was focused on trade diversification, resource development, and cost containment. Surprising departures for a government that had been mostly concerned with spending public funds, even when it didn't have the actual cash to do so. The biggest departure from long-standing NDP policy was a vow to lift the regulatory burden and expedite approval of $20 billion worth of resource projects - mines, wind farms, pipelines - to offset the anticipated impact of the tariffs. The regulatory burden in question was imposed and/or sustained by the New Democrats themselves through seven years of government. Still, the premier named names for the first dozen-and-a-half projects targeted for expedited approval, providing some basis for gauging his definition of ""fast tracking."" One of the mining projects on his list has been in the review process for six years. Another is in its fourth year and counting. For now, the biggest potential holdup is obtaining consent from First Nations. The New Democrats can't avoid consulting and accommodating the Indigenous peoples on whose territory those projects are located. There's room for Eby to expand the list beyond the 18 projects named initially. He made no mention of the possibility of proceeding with the second phase of the LNG Canada project, allowing a doubling of production at the export terminal in Kitimat. It would readily fit with the premier's objective of reducing dependence on the U.S. market for B.C.'s natural gas. The project also has strong First Nations support. Shell and its four partners in the joint ownership of LNG Canada have not yet reached a final investment decision on proceeding with Phase 2. The partners may also be waiting for the government to give a final direction on powering the expanded project. Phase 1 is powered with natural gas. Hydroelectric power would reduce emissions in Phase 2. But there is not yet sufficient hydro power and backup available in Kitimat. Eby indulged in a few crowd-pleasing, media-coverage-generating stunts - like prematurely banishing bourbon and other ""red state"" booze from B.C. government liquor stores. He took risks, too, like calling on British Columbians to avoid holidaying in the U.S. while presuming that the Americans would not reciprocate to the detriment of our tourism industry. The premier seized the opening to suggest that the government might not be able to afford its $1.8-billion election platform promise of a ""grocery rebate"" of up to $1,000 a family, $500 for individuals. He also reiterated the need for an ""efficiency review"" of government programs. He acknowledged that the review was a departure from NDP policy and said the need was greater given the tariff threat. ""We've been in government for seven years,"" Eby told reporters. ""The situation in B.C. in 2025 is not the same as it was in 2017. Having a look at all our programs, making sure that they're keeping up with what we face now as opposed to the challenges we may have faced three or four years ago."" He's probably hoping that the public sector unions will take the hint from all this talk of austerity and lower expectations in this year's contract talks. All in all, the result was a freshened agenda for a premier who badly needed one after squandering much of the political and fiscal momentum he inherited from John Horgan. Not likely will Eby acknowledge that these changes were prompted by Trump. But nor is it likely that he would have moved this far, this quickly, without the impetus provided by the devilmay-care occupant of the White House. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 11, 2025",Provincial elections; Native North Americans; Tariffs,Nom: LNG Canada; NAICS: 221210,2025-02-11,The Vancouver Sun
"Choudhry to run for the Liberals in Sudbury; Ontario election Four people now running in the riding, now held by Jamie West for the NDP",2025,"The Liberals now have a candidate to run in the Sudbury riding for the provincial election on Feb. 27. Rashid Mukhtar Choudhry, a local businessman, joins a race that already includes incumbent Jamie West for the NDP, Max Massimiliano for the Progressive Conservatives, David Robinson for the Green Party and David Sylvestre for the None of the Above Party. Sylvestre, however, is not yet listed on the Elections Ontario website. The Liberals have not formally announced that Choudhry is running, but he is listed as their Sudbury candidate on the party's website. In Nickel Belt, three candidates are confirmed to run. France Gelinas is seeking to hold onto the seat for the NDP, while Liberal Natalie Labbee and Progressive Conservative Randy Hazlett hope to unseat her. Speaking of Gelinas, the NDP candidate has opened her campaign office, located at 3030 Hwy 69 North in Val Caron, formerly the M&M Food Market. Gelinas invites voters to drop in or call 705-588-2358 or 1-844588-235. ROBINSON TO RUN FOR THE GREEN PARTY IN SUDBURY David Robinson will once carry the Green Party's colours in a provincial election. Robinson, an economist and Laurentian University professor, announced Thursday he will run for the Greens in the Sudbury riding. Ontario voters go to the polls on Feb. 27. In a release, Robinson said only the Green Party can effectively deal with climate change. ""When we deal with the top-of-mind issues, we have to push toward climate adaptation,"" he said. ""Shortrun panic will waste time and give us half-baked solutions. Even the tariff kerfuffle gives us chances to build a better, safer Canada."" The release said Robinson, who has run provincially and federally for the Greens in Sudbury in past elections without success, is ""an economist who has made important contributions to the Sudbury economy. ""He identified and promoted the Northern Ontario Mining Supply and Service sector and proposed the Northern Ontario School of Architecture. He is a leading expert and teacher on Northern Ontario's economic development,"" the release said. ""No other candidate understands the economy and how governments work like David does,"" Green spokesperson Tree Rost said. ""No other candidate comes close to understanding the climate crisis like he does."" Besides climate change, Robinson touched on a number of other issues in announcing he was going to run again. ""The last three provincial governments created the housing crisis,"" he said. ""Housing is a provincial responsibility. They abandoned Canada's historic public and social housing programs. Now, people are paying through the nose with rising prices and housing shortages. The Green Party has a plan that will work. ""This election is not about tariffs - it is happening because (Premier) Doug Ford doesn't want to face the music of his failure on every major portfolio from healthcare and housing to municipal taxes and dollar-a-bottle beer.'' Ford has said he called the election earlier than required despite having a majority government because he wants a strong mandate to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump and his threats to impose tariffs on Canadian goods.

Ford promises Windsor a helicopter; NDP pledges 'grocery rebate'; Ontario election,2025,"With less than three weeks until Ontarians head to the polls, Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford on the weekend continued to emphasize border security as a top campaign issue, promising that Windsor gets a helicopter if he's re-elected. ""With President Trump's tariff threats continuing to loom over Ontario workers and businesses, and fentanyl continuing to hurt too many families and communities, we need to take real, tangible action to protect our borders and communities,"" Ford told reporters during a news conference Saturday at Niagara-on-the-Lake. Ford has pledged $50 million toward expanding the Ontario Provincial Police's Joint Air Support Unit if re-elected. Ford's pledge to help Windsor's police take to the sky to patrol one of North America's busiest border crossings came amid a flurry of policy announcements from Ontario's opposition parties over the weekend. But Ontario's NDP and Liberal parties - rejecting Ford's rationalization for an early election to handle another four years of U.S. President Donald Trump - are keeping health care and affordability top of mind in their promises to Ontarians. Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles promised to introduce a monthly grocery rebate. Stiles said up to four million lower- and middle-income households could pocket up to $122 per month to offset the burgeoning cost of groceries. ""That's over $1,400 per year,"" Stiles said during a campaign stop in Toronto Saturday. The NDP said the program would cost about $409 million per month. ""What I hear from people as I'm criss-crossing Ontario is that ev- erybody is fed up with paying too much for basics like bread, rice and vegetables,"" said Stiles. If elected to government, she said the NDP would introduce policies to curb price gouging at grocery stores and establish a consumer watchdog. Ford's plan to bulk up border security would give the Windsor Police Service and Niagara Regional Police each an H-135 helicopter to monitor shared crossings along the U.S. border. ""Today's measures are a serious commitment from our Ontario PC team to fight illegal drugs and crack down on illegal cross-border activity,"" Ford said. That pledge backs the federal government's $1.3-billion commitment to strengthen Canada's borders, which includes appointing a fentanyl czar to crack down on opioid trafficking. As voting day on Feb. 27 approaches, however, the focus of the opposition parties is on more bread-and-butter issues and the Ford government's previous performance. Bonnie Crombie's Liberals have promised to appoint a special investigator to probe controversial Ford government decisions, including the shuttering of the Ontario Science Centre and the since-reversed Greenbelt development plan. Opening the Greenbelt for developers led to a public outcry and an RCMP investigation that remains ongoing, though Ford has denied any wrongdoing. The weekend of campaign announcements included the Liberals airing two 30-second Super Bowl commercials to Canadian audiences on Sunday. One featured a clip of Ford expressing support for Trump's presidential bid, and accused him of leveraging U.S. tariff threats for political gain.

Singh calls for border patrol training in Windsor,2025,"Federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced Monday that a government led by his party would help staunch the flow of illegal guns into Canada by building a new border patrol training facility in Windsor. Singh, visiting Windsor on Monday, said the centre would create more jobs in the city in addition to better preparing the Canada Border Services Agency to stop gun smuggling by bolstering its officer ranks. ""The Canada I believe in is a safe place where people don't have to worry that anyone near them has an illegal handgun in their pocket or glove compartment,"" said Singh. ""Gun violence leaves people traumatized, tears apart communities and costs lives."" Singh toured Windsor with a federal election expected in the near future. The Conservatives and NDP have promised to topple the Liberal government with a non-confidence vote as soon as the Liberals choose a new leader in March and Parliament returns. The Liberals launched a leadership race last month after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was stepping down in the face of a growing revolt among his ranks and plunging numbers in the polls. Singh made the border commitment Monday afternoon following a meeting at the Ambassador Bridge. Singh also stopped by the Unifor union hall on Turner Road, where he announced a plan to create and protect auto jobs with large rebates for Canadian-made electric vehicles, as well as a pledge to slap 100-per-cent tariffs on all Tesla products, targeting the U.S. company owned by Elon Musk. ""Trump's trade war is a nightmare for Canadian auto workers - they're going to work every day not knowing if shutdowns and layoffs are coming, not knowing if they'll be able to keep putting food on the table."" Singh pledged to revive a $5,000 rebate for buying an electric vehicle that was scrapped by the Liberals in January. The NDP plan would include a $10,000 rebate cheque for buying a Canadian-made electric vehicle Singh, joined by MP Brian Masse (NDP - Windsor West), was the latest of a number of high-profile politicians to visit Unifor in Windsor in recent weeks and woo union members. Provincial Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford visited the Local 444/200 union hall on the first day of the Ontario election campaign. Provincial NDP Leader Marit Stiles was there a few days later. Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Unifor on Jan. 16. Following his union meeting, Singh visited the Ambassador Bridge later in the day to announce his plan for a CBSA training facility in Windsor. The new facility would boost Canada's ability to train hundreds more officers per year to meet existing and emerging border challenges, he said. The NDP has also committed to hiring thousands of new CBSA officers and expanding the agency's mandate so its members can patrol the border between official border crossings. ""Border officers - not machines - stop illegal guns from entering this country, and we need to ensure Canada's ports of entry have the personnel to do so,' Singh said. ""That's why the NDP would hire thousands more border officers.

NDP to announce inquiry into scandal-ridden police HQ project,2025,"AN inquiry into the scandal-plagued construction of the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters will be launched today, the Free Press has learned. Government sources confirmed Premier Wab Kinew will announce the hiring of Winnipeg labour lawyer Garth Smorang as chief commissioner, as well as the terms of reference that will guide the inquiry. Smorang will be authorized to “inquire into the affairs of the City of Winnipeg and determine if any measures are necessary to restore public confidence in the ability of the city to implement large-scale, publicly funded construction projects.” He will have the ability to review “the dealings of previous elected officials, including the mayor, and senior employees of the City of Winnipeg, including the chief administrative officer.” Smorang, who will be asked to complete his work by Jan. 1, 2027, has a budget of $2 million, the sources said. The inquiry fulfils a pledge made by Premier Wab Kinew shortly after the NDP won the October 2023 election. At that time, Kinew said Manitobans needed answers to “factual questions” about the downtown HQ project and the roles played by Sam Katz, who was mayor at the time, and Phil Sheegl, who was the city’s chief administrative officer. Government sources, whose names are being withheld because they are not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that Smorang, an experienced lawyer who has won several landmark cases for Manitoba unions, will head the commission. Smorang helped the Canadian Auto Workers Union win a $6-million judgment for bargaining in bad faith against Buhler-Versatile, a tractor manufacturer that bought the company during the strike. He was also the lead counsel for the University of Manitoba Faculty Association which, in 2017, won a $17-million judgment against the Progressive Conservative government for secretly influencing contract talks between the union and school. In his new assignment, Smorang will be charged with finding closure to a scandal that — despite being more than 10 years old — is plagued by unanswered questions, including why none of the major players was charged. Originally pegged at $135 million in 2009, the project to establish a new headquarters for the WPS on the site of the former Canada Post warehouse and office tower at Smith Street and Graham Avenue was beset by delays and cost overruns. By the time it was completed in 2016, the price had soared to $214 million. In 2014, the city hired KPMG to conduct an audit. It raised issues about the processes for awarding contracts and procuring materials, and a general lack of oversight. The KPMG report and two other audits, one of which probed questionable real estate transactions, were provided to the RCMP for review. Over the next five years, two separate RCMP criminal investigations — linked by the involvement of Katz and Sheegl — were conducted. However, in 2019, Manitoba Justice announced it would not lay any criminal charges. No explanation was given for the decision. Concern about that decision erupted again in 2021, when then-Opposition leader Kinew tabled a copy of a 2017 confidential briefing note that confirmed the RCMP had recommended charges be laid “relating to financial crimes with an estimated value of over $33 million.” In a 2022 civil proceeding, Manitoba Court of King’s Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal found that Sheegl had accepted a $327,000 bribe from Caspian Construction, the HQ project’s general contractor, in 2011. Joyal ordered Sheegl to pay the City of Winnipeg $1.1 million in severance payments and penalties. The city’s civil suit was based on case files from the RCMP, obtained via court order after Manitoba Justice decided not to charge anyone. In March 2023, city council approved a $21.5-million settlement of the separate civil suit against Caspian, principal Armik Babakhanians, his wife and son, and several related companies. The settlement increases depending on when it’s paid. Because Caspian missed the first deadline, it owes $22.5 million if it pays by March 2025. The city placed a $28-million mortgage on several properties linked to Caspian last year. As of late 2024, neither Sheegl nor Caspian had paid the city any money. dan.lett@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Dan Lett","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Lett, Dan",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 11, 2025",Criminal investigations; Scandals,,2025-02-11,Winnipeg Free Press

""That's over $1,400 per year,"" Stiles said during a campaign stop in Toronto Saturday. The NDP said the program would cost about $409 million per month. ""What I hear from people as I'm criss-crossing Ontario is that everybody is fed up with paying too much for basics like bread, rice and vegetables,"" said Stiles. If elected to government, she said the NDP would introduce policies to curb price gouging at grocery stores and establish a consumer watchdog. Ford's plan to bulk up border security would give the Windsor Police Service and Niagara Regional Police each an H-135 helicopter to monitor shared crossings along the U.S. border. ""Today's measures are a serious commitment from our Ontario PC team to fight illegal drugs and crack down on illegal cross-border activity,"" Ford said. That pledge backs the federal government's $1.3-billion commitment to strengthen Canada's borders, which includes appointing a fentanyl czar to crack down on opioid trafficking. As voting day on Feb. 27 quickly approaches, however, the focus of the opposition parties is on more bread-and-butter issues and the Ford government's previous performance. Bonnie Crombie's Liberals have promised to appoint a special investigator to probe controversial Ford government decisions, including the shuttering of the Ontario Science Centre and the since-reversed Greenbelt development plan. Opening the Greenbelt for developers led to a public outcry and an RCMP investigation that remains ongoing, though Ford has denied any wrongdoing. The weekend of campaign announcements included the Liberals airing two 30-second Super Bowl commercials to Canadian audiences on Sunday. One featured a clip of Ford expressing support for Trump's presidential bid, and accused him of leveraging U.S. tariff threats for political gain. - With files from the Canadian Press mmazak@postmedia.com",The Windsor Star (Online); Windsor,Windsor,"Mazak, Madeline",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 10, 2025",Political campaigns; Opposition parties; Fentanyl; Border security; Tariffs,,2025-02-10,The Windsor Star
NDP's disastrous 'housing first' plan,2025,"Last week, Marit Stiles, leader of the Ontario NDP, told Ontarians she will end the encampment crisis in Ontario - by forcing them to live like the rest of us. Sounds noble, except it's been tried before and has failed. Stiles fundamentally misunderstands how Ontarians end up in encampments in the first place, as if there's a direct line from losing one's home to living in a tent in a park. Encampments have risen in Canada for a number of reasons, the least likely of which is the lack of affordable housing, as Stiles believes. Evidence suggests it's mental health and substance abuse that are the major drivers of encampments across Canada. During her visit to the riding of Parkdale-High Park in Toronto, Stiles told Ontarians, ""The Ontario NDP will end the encampments by supporting people and by helping them find a home to live in."" She continued, ""How will we do it? We will support municipalities with their shelter and community housing costs, and we'll also undo the damage that was done when Liberals and Conservatives downloaded housing to cities. We' ll get the government back to building supportive housing, that's a permanent home that has wraparound support like mental health care or addiction support and more. We'll help with paying rent, to get people out of shelter and into homes quickly, and also free up more shelter space. And we're gonna prevent home- lessness by increasing social assistance and protecting renters to keep more people in their homes to begin with."" When asked by a reporter what this would cost, Stiles did not provide an amount. She later told the crowd, ""The answer to the crisis is housing, right?"" As if asking the question before continuing and confirming her own assumptions, ""It's housing first."" Housing may be the neat and tidy issue Stiles would like to focus her campaign on, but like most things, the problem of encampments is far more complicated. Ontarians don't simply go from losing their homes to living in a park. Stiles fundamentally misunderstands homelessness. In actuality, encampment-living is far more likely to be a result of addictions and mental illness than the lack of affordable housing. According to a 20202022 government survey of 26,000 homeless in 87 communities across Canada, 61 per cent reported having substance use issues, 60 per cent reported having mental health issues and 47 per cent reported having both. And the numbers for mental health and addiction for the homeless may be even higher. As the survey notes, it had an 87 per cent response rate. As we all know, mental health and addictions are still highly stigmatized, so it would not be surprising if that's one of the main reasons why 13 per cent chose not to respond. And while the relationship between mental health and substance abuse and homelessness can be bidirectional, in that someone could become homeless and then develop mental health issues and addictions, the latter situation is far less likely. In fact, only eight per cent of respondents reported neither mental health nor substance use issues as be- ing the reason for their loss of housing. Does this sound like a ""housing first"" problem, Stiles? Common sense should tell most Ontarians that mentally well Canadians who are not addicts don't typically fast-track to living in a tent. And if Stiles thinks those living in encampments can quickly adjust to shelters, community housing or live on their own, paid for by themselves or government, she hasn't been paying attention. While this might work for some high-functioning residents, it's not likely to work for many with addictions and mental health issues, which are often combined. A good example of this is a failed San Francisco experiment where encampment members were put up in hotels. Rooms were destroyed, there was rampant illegal drug use and disorder, and, of course, having a hotel room did not stop people from dying from overdoses. In addition to mental health and addictions issues, some of those put up in the hotels had criminal backgrounds. Encampments are not well-functioning peaceful Smurf villages with individuals who can quickly transition to intermediate and regular housing, on the government dime or not. Another likely driver for the encampments and rising crime in Ontario and the rest of Canada is the process of ""deinstitutionalization,"" which occurred across the country between 1960 and 1980. This meant that chronic mental health patients were discharged from institutions with beds, 24/7 care and supervision, and suddenly became the responsibility of local community mental health ser vices, which were not equipped to handle them. This is the same reason why Stiles' claim that a permanent home with what she refers to as ""wrap around support"" is not likely to solve the problem either. Here's the issue: there will always be some individuals who will never be able to fully function in society and who are, frankly, dangerous to others and themselves. Some of these individuals need around-the-clock support and supervision. Unfortunately, they now slip through the cracks and end up on our streets and in our parks. Those who are not dangerous still may need the kind of support that can only be given in long-term institutions. Those who are functional, but at risk of homelessness, would no doubt benefit from access to psychological and financial counselling, as well as addictions services. As noted by social worker Ann Braden Johnson in her 1990 book on the American experience, ""Out of Bedlam: The Truth About Deinstitutionalization,"" the movement was largely based on the flawed premise that the mentally ill, with the assistance of medication and community support, could return to a normal functioning life in society. And let's not fool ourselves, it was also about saving government money. This put additional pressure on hospitals, community centres and police. Look around. Sound familiar? Ontario, and the rest of Canada, is experiencing an encampment crisis, and something does have to be done about it. But solving that crisis requires understanding the situation first. Stiles does taxpayers and those living in encampments no favours by putting forward a plan like this. My guess is that organizations that specialize in these issues will tell Stiles that this crisis is not ""housing first,"" but ""mental health and addictions first,"" and I hope they shout it, loud and clear.

Fighting to get on voters' radar; Ontario NDP leader works to raise visibility,2025,"This is the first in a series ofprofiles ofthe leaders of Ontario's three main parties. Marit Stiles is in a good spot. For a party leader in a snap election, her weakness is not in her starting position. The Ontario New Democratic Party has won Opposition status in the last two elections, and as leader, Stiles whipped the votes of 28 members against a Progressive Conservative majority. That is a good run for this traditionally third place party, and a solid base camp from which to push higher toward government. But in this election, the incumbent Premier Doug Ford seems to be running against the president of the United States, and on track for a third majority, almost unheard of in Canadian politics. When he does acknowledge other Ontario parties, he treats the third-place Liberals long obliterated in the legislature with fewer MPPs than most people have fingers, their leader Bonnie Crombie without even her own seat as his main competition. The challenge for Stiles, therefore, is getting noticed. When she does, it tends to go well. Stiles projects a positive, sunny tone, typically coming across as affable and smiling, approachable and optimistic, said Geneviève Tellier, professor of political science at the University of Ottawa. This personal communication style aligns well with the NDP's political project, she said. ""The NDP has always showcased themselves as a caring party, attending to the needs of those who need more from the state,"" Tellier said. ""It's hard to sell that in an aggressive tone. I see a good fit between the party and their leader."" ""Used to be, you had to act like a man .. like Margaret Thatcher,"" Tellier said. ""I think that this has changed a lot, generally speaking in Canada, but more so on the Ontarian scene. With Stiles, we are in this continuity."" This week, Stiles was in Ottawa, where she once studied at Carleton University, and she addressed her audience in French. It was not polished Quebec diction, but a sort of Queen's Park French, a stilted work in progress, but an effort all the same. ""She's kind of at the beginning, but francophones applaud that,"" Tellier said. Likewise, last week in Windsor, addressing the auto industry and the union voters sO key to the NDP base, Tellier saw a party leader who can credibly connect policy to her own values without coming across like she has been workshopped and focus-grouped by her communications team. ""I think we have seen stability with her since she was elected. We didn't see her change. She could have changed, especially with Doug Ford in front of her. But she remained constant in how she presents herself to the population,"" Tellier said. ""She did not change. She's constant. It works well for her."" Elizabeth Goodyear- Grant, professor and graduate chair in political studies at Queen's University, saw Stiles recently in Kingston, supporting the local candidate. ""I think that she has an image that seems to me is true to who she is as a person, as someone who really is approachable, warm, supportive,"" Goodyear- Grant said. Her weakness is in visibility, Goodyear-Grant said, in part because her experience is largely in political backrooms. This gives her knowledge and connections, butit does not drive votes. ""That visibility piece means that she is going to have to work a bit harder to introduce herself to the electorate,"" Goodyear- Grant said. Marit Stiles, 55, was born in Newfoundland and grew up on a small family farm in the St. John's area, the elder of two girls to Kathy Stiles, who worked in environmental education, and Geoff Stiles, an anthropology professor at Memorial University. Her name is frequently mispronounced, and she has described her equanimity about this. It was suggested by her parents' Norwegian friends. The first syllable rhymes with ""car,"" not ""care."" It is not pronounced like ""merit."" And yet it usually is. She moved to Ottawa to attend Carleton University when her family moved to Africa, and later to Toronto to work as executive assistant to northern Ontario New Democrat MPP Gilles Bisson, then northern development minister Shelley Martel. She worked in research for a think-tank called Canadian Policy Research Networks, and ran research and policy for ACTRA, a trade union for workers in film, television and radio. She was a Toronto District School Board trustee in 2014, then became president of the federal NDP in 2016, and in 2018 took Davenport, a central Toronto riding, from the Liberals. She was acclaimed leader of the Ontario NDP in 2023. She has two grown daughters with Jordan Berger, an investment adviser who has also been involved in NDP politics. Now contesting her first election as leader, she presents as a politician in the mould of her predecessor Andrea Horwath, whose personal popularity in the 2022 election was higher among the general public than any of her rival party leaders for similar reasons and impressions. The danger for Stiles, then, is that she goes the way of Horwath and resigns after failing to translate that personal popularity into local candidate votes, even perhaps losing Official Opposition status. The going has been tough against a Progressive Conservative majority and an Ontario Liberal Party getting back on its feet, moving to the centre, and squeezing the government. To take this election, Stiles will need her own base, plus the votes parked with her party since the collapse of the Liberal Party under Kathleen Wynne, and then some. That means flipping Progressive Conservative voters who see grounds to reject Doug Ford, for example over the scandal involving alleged insider dealing in property development on protected Greenbelt land, which claimed the resignations of two cabinet ministers, and is still under RCMP investigation. (Ford's government is co-operating with the investigation and denies any criminality.) Such a scandal could be a winner for a left-wing campaigner against a long-term Tory incumbent.","Kingston Whig - Standard; Kingston, Ont.","Kingston, Ont.","Brean, Joseph",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 8, 2025",Scandals; Voters; Labor unions; Elections; Political parties,Nom: Carleton University; NAICS: 611310,2025-02-08,Kingston Whig - Standard
"Lawyers agree man is a long-term offender; Crown, defence say McLaughlin deserves designation for domestic violence history",2025,"SASKATOON It's likely that Clinton James McLaughlin will be designated a long-term offender after he was convicted of assaulting an intimate partner - his ffi th - during a violent incident east of Saskatoon. At his long-term offender hearing in November, the Crown and defence agreed the 47-year-old should receive the designation based on his pattern of repeated domestic violence over 20 years. However, when arguments were made on Jan. 24, they disagreed on how long his sentence should be. Long-term offenders receive determinate prison sentences followed by long-term supervision orders that aim to prevent them from reoffending. It is less restrictive than a dangerous-offender designation, which can include an indeterminate sentence. Crown prosecutor Jaimie MacLean argued for a six-year sentence - five years for choking and confining his girlfriend in a truck on an isolated road off Highway 16 on Dec. 5, 2020, and one year for stealing her guns - followed by 10 years of community supervision. At McLaughlin's 2023 trial, Nicole Mason testified that she thought she was going to die as he repeatedly pushed his fist into her throat - pinning her to the back of his truck's passenger seat so she couldn't move or breathe - as they drove out to a farm near Clavet. Mason said he pulled onto a back road and wouldn't let her leave the truck after she refused to acknowledge his cheating accusations during an argument. She said he pulled her back, causing her head to hit the vehicle, when she tried to grab her phone. It happened less than a year after McLaughlin finished serving a six-year sentence for two other domestic assaults, including choking a previous partner and then kidnapping and beating his ex-fiancée in 2014. His criminal record shows he committed his first domestic violence offence in 2003. ""Clearly, his previous sentences have not been adequate to achieve (the) principals of denunciation and deterrence,"" MacLean said, noting his six prior convictions against four different women, and a peace bond involving a fifth woman. Doctors testified that McLaughlin hasn't ""internalized"" the treatment he received during his prior prison sentence. ""He's almost like an untreated offender,"" MacLean said. She told court that a 10-year supervision order would provide public protection and ensure McLaughlin gets much-needed treatment in the community. Defence lawyer Sylvan Lange said while corrections staff deemed McLaughlin ""high risk"" during his previous sentence, he was put in moderate treatment programs instead of high intensity programs, and there were no ""adaptations"" for his learning difficulties. Lange noted an adaptive program option exists at the Regional Psychiatric Centre (a federal institution in Saskatoon), arguing for a three-year sentence and a seven-year supervision order. He said McLaughlin has received no treatment for his traumatic childhood, which included physical abuse from family members who also normalized violence against their domestic partners. He couldn't read until Grade 8 and ""always considered himself to be stupid,"" which helped create a lonely, angry and distrustful young man, Lange said. McLaughlin will remain out of custody until his scheduled sentencing decision on April 15. Court heard he has been working in a remote northern community, where he lives a ""quiet, predictable lifestyle."" Lange noted that he hasn't breached his release conditions while in the community with minimal supervision over the last four years, and even had a few ""casual intimate relationships"" that ended ""without issue."" McLaughlin knows he has an issue and wants to change, Lange said. Standing in the gallery of the mostly empty courtroom, McLaughlin told Judge Brad Mitchell he came to ""own up"" to what he's done.","Leader Post; Regina, Sask.","Regina, Sask.","Mcadam, Bre",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 8, 2025",Criminal sentences; Supervision; Domestic violence; Assaults,,2025-02-08,Leader Post

"Ontario Liberals, NDP must merge or keep losing",2025,"Ontario's left-of-centre parties and their supporters need to accept a basic political reality. As long as they continue to split their votes three ways, they are going to lose election after election. Recent polls couldn't be much better for PC leader Doug Ford. The latest Leger poll for National Post shows the PCs with 47-per-cent support. The Liberals are at 23 per cent, the NDP 17 and the Greens eight per cent. The PCs dominate in every geographic area of the province; there are no progressive strongholds left. It's a potential political disaster for the left-of-centre, but combined, the three parties attract as much vote support as the PCs. A single progressive party could be neck-and-neck with Ford, but divided all three will be distant losers. That's a recipe for long-term political disaster, and in leaders Bonnie Crombie, Marit Stiles and Mike Schreiner, the parties have just the people to prepare the dish. Finding one good leader to represent the left-wing world view is clearly a challenge, but three? The problem is made worse by the fact that the parties seem destined to lose. That doesn't attract people who want to accomplish something. Are the parties different enough to justify their perpetual mutual destruction? It's as if the people who favour French vanilla ice cream formed their own party to compete fiercely with those who prefer the vanilla bean alternative. For PC supporters, this all sounds like a dream come true, but not quite. When a premier has no realistic fear of electoral defeat, it causes him to do things he might not do otherwise. Would Ford have called a premature February election if he thought there was any chance he was going to lose? Not on your life. It's not just that. Without a solid centre-left alternative, the PCs have drifted left themselves. Rather than focusing on balanced budgets and tax cuts, Ford's version of the party features big deficits and actually boasts of ""historic"" levels of spending. PC supporters might not like that, but what are they to do, vote NDP? To be a real conservative party again, the PCs need a viable opponent just as much as the progressives need a single party. The solution to this problem is easy to see, although it will be difficult to implement. Let's start by eliminating the Green Party. They have two seats, get vote support in the single digits and their leader seems like a nice guy, but he's not exactly Mr. Charisma. The only thing the Green Party achieves is making it more difficult for another progressive party to succeed. The NDP would seem the obvious choice to lead the left, in that they are the official opposition with 28 seats, but the party has been trending downward. When Liberal party support collapsed in 2018, the NDP had a glorious chance at success. Instead, the party fell well short, winning 40 seats and 32 per cent of the vote. The 2022 election was worse with 31 seats and just under 24 per cent of the vote. The negative trend continues in this election. Poll support is down and only 13 per cent name NDP leader Stiles as best choice for premier. Stiles has been leader for two years and who knows anything about her? At least former leader Andrea Horwath had name recognition, if only as the person who'd lost previous elections. So, the Liberals then. Leader Bonnie Crombie started this election in a tough spot, with only nine seats in the legislature and no seat of her own. Without a solid core of incumbent MPPs who have a decent shot at re-election, winning power is a big challenge. That said, Crombie has made affordability and housing promises that could resonate with the public, and they aren't ideas the NDP had first. Crombie is promising significant tax decreases and she has a plan to reduce the cost of housing. These are the sort of real world issues that ideologically-driven parties tend to ignore. Even the NDP is showing a modest drift toward reality. This week, Stiles said she would take the tolls off Highway 407, which would amount to a major subsidy for commuters and commercial trucking. The toll highway generated about $1.5 billion in revenue in 2023. The plan was a surprise from the bicycling party. Maybe the parties on the left are starting to understand that if they want to take votes away from the PCs, they need to do it by moving to the centre. That's where Ford has found his success. Even with more appealing policies, both parties face a long road back to power. It's a road that would be a lot shorter if they formed one party.

Fighting to get on voters' radar; Ontario ndp leader works to raise visibility This is the first in a series of profiles of the leaders of Ontario's three main parties,2025,"Marit Stiles is in a good spot. For a party leader in a snap election, her weakness is not in her starting position. The Ontario New Democratic Party has won Opposition status in the last two elections, and as leader, Stiles whipped the votes of 28 members against a Progressive Conservative majority. That is a good run for this traditionally third place party, and a solid base camp from which to push higher toward government. But in this election, the current premier, Doug Ford, seems to be running against the president of the United States, and on track for a third majority, almost unheard of in Canadian politics. When he does acknowledge other Ontario parties, he treats the third-place Liberals - long obliterated in the legislature with fewer MPPs than most people have fingers, their leader Bonnie Crombie without even her own seat - as his main com - petition. The challenge for Stiles, therefore, is getting noticed. When she does, it tends to go well. Stiles projects a positive, sunny tone, typically coming across as affable and smiling, approachable and optimistic, said Geneviève Tellier, professor of political science at the University of Ottawa. This personal communication style aligns well with the NDP's political project, she said. ""The NDP has always showcased themselves as a caring party, attending to the needs of those who need more from the state,"" Tellier said. ""It's hard to sell that in an aggressive tone. I see a good fit between the party and their leader."" ""Used to be, you had to act like a man ... like Margaret Thatcher,"" Tellier said. ""I think that this has changed a lot, generally speaking in Canada, but more so on the Ontarian scene. With Stiles, we are in this continuity."" This week, Stiles was in Ottawa, where she once studied at Carleton University, and she addressed her audience in French. It was not polished Quebec diction, but a sort of Queen's Park French, a stilted work in progress, but an effort all the same. ""She's kind of at the beginning, but francophones applaud that,"" Tellier said. Likewise, last week in Windsor, addressing the auto industry and the union voters so key to the NDP base, Tellier saw a party leader who can credibly connect policy to her own values without coming across like she has been workshopped and focus-grouped by her communications team. ""I think we have seen stability with her since she was elected. We didn't see her change. She could have changed, especially with Doug Ford in front of her. But she remained constant in how she presents herself to the population,"" Tellier said. ""She did not change. She's constant. It works well for her."" Elizabeth Good - year-Grant, professor and graduate chair in political studies at Queen's University, saw Stiles recently in Kingston, supporting the local candidate. ""I think that she has an image that seems to me is true to who she is as a person, as someone who really is approachable, warm, supportive,"" Goodyear-Grant said. Her weakness is in visibility, Goodyear-Grant said, in part because her experience is largely in political backrooms. This gives her knowledge and connections, but it does not drive votes. ""That visibility piece means that she is going to have to work a bit harder to introduce herself to the electorate,"" Goodyear-Grant said. Marit Stiles, 55, was born in Newfoundland and grew up on a small family farm in the St. John's area, the elder of two girls to Kathy Stiles, who worked in environmental education, and Geoff Stiles, an anthropology professor at Memorial University. Her name is frequently mispronounced, and she has described her equanimity about this. It was suggested by her parents' Norwegian friends. The first syllable rhymes with ""car,"" not ""care."" It is not pronounced like ""merit."" And yet it usually is. She moved to Ottawa to attend Carleton University when her family moved to Africa, and later she went to Toronto to work as executive assistant to northern Ontario New Democrat MPP Gilles Bisson, and then northern development minister Shelley Martel. She worked in research for a think tank called Canadian Policy Research Networks, and ran research and policy for ACTRA, a trade union for workers in film, television and radio. She was a Toronto District School Board trustee in 2014, then became president of the federal NDP party in 2016, and in 2018 took Davenport, a central Toronto riding, from the Liberals. She was acclaimed leader of the Ontario NDP in 2023. She has two grown daughters with Jordan Berger, an investment adviser who has also been involved in NDP politics. Now contesting her first election as leader, she presents as a politician in the mould of her predecessor Andrea Horwath, whose personal popularity in the 2022 election was higher among the general public than any of her rival party leaders for similar reasons and impressions. The danger for Stiles, then, is that she goes the way of Horwath and resigns after failing to translate that personal popularity into local candidate votes, even perhaps losing Official Opposition status. The going has been tough against a Progressive Conservative majority and an Ontario Liberal Party get- ting back on its feet, moving to the centre, and squeezing the government. Within her party, a key early challenge for Stiles was in the renegade MPP Sarah Jama who refused Stiles' request to apologize and retract a one-sided and inflammatory statement about Israel after the Hamas atrocity of Oct. 7, 2023. That led Stiles to kick her out of the party for insubordination and making work environments unsafe for staff, after which Stiles' own constituency office was vandalized with red paint and signs saying ""blood on your hands"" and ""Free Palestine."" ""I think it caused some problems for her,"" Good - year-Grant said. There was internal support, but there were also internal calls for Stiles' resignation. ""Any attempt by a leader to usurp local autonomy is never taken well."" To take this election, Stiles will need her own base, plus the votes parked with her party since the collapse of the Liberal Party under Kathleen Wynne, and then some. That means flipping Progressive Conservative voters who see grounds to reject Doug Ford, for example over the scandal involving alleged insider dealing in property development on protected Greenbelt land, which claimed the resignations of two cabinet ministers, and is still under RCMP investigation. (Ford's government is co-operating with the investigation and denies any criminality.) Such a scandal could be a winner for a left-wing campaigner against a long-term Tory incumbent. But Stiles has struggled to command the attention she needs to drive that message, not least because of bigger fears about trade war with America, but also because Ford's Progressive Conservatives have waged their fiercest offence against the Ontario Liberal Party leader. ""Which is weird,"" said Goodyear-Grant. ""It's weird because the New Democrats are the Official Opposition and have been for a while."" The NDP are the government in waiting now, Goodyear-Grant said. The challenge for Stiles is to end that long wait.

NDP misdiagnose heart of health authority audits,2025,"If the NDP government was hoping a series of audits of health authorities would support its claim that bloated bureaucracies are contributing to poor patient care, it didn’t get it. The Kinew government on Wednesday released the results of three independent audits of the province’s regional health authorities (except Southern Health). The main finding: most, including Shared Health and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, are running deficits virtually every year and it’s hurting patient care. But it’s not because of high administrative costs, at least according to the audits. On the contrary, the consulting firm MNP — which audited Shared Health and the WRHA — found Manitoba’s health authorities have among the lowest administration costs in Canada (eighth out of 12 jurisdictions). Shared Health is an exception. It had the highest administration costs in Manitoba as a percentage of total spending, at 8.34 per cent in 2022-2023. One wonders why that level of bureaucracy even exists when each region of the province already has its own health authority. CancerCare had the lowest administrative costs at 3.26 per cent of total spending, followed by Prairie Mountain Health at 3.85 per cent. The WRHA’s administration costs were 3.9 per cent of total spending. The provincial average was 5.16 per cent in 2022-2023. That’s not to say there isn’t bureaucratic fat to cut. I’ve documented several times in this column how administration costs at health authorities have ballooned in recent years. Overall, they’re up 41 per cent over the past five years, from $218.5 million in 2019-2020 to $307.6 million in 2023-2024. As a percentage of total operating costs, administrative spending has increased only slightly. It was 4.3 per cent in 2019-2020 and grew to 4.79 per cent in 2023-2024. Still, it is an increase, and the total dollar value is high. But that was not one of the findings in this week’s audit reports. The NDP campaigned on reducing bureaucratic costs in health care and ordered regional authorities last year to cut administrative costs by eight per cent. And while Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara this week reiterated the government’s claim that “bloated bureaucracies” within health authorities are taking resources away from front-line care, none of the audits made that finding. They found the opposite. “The WRHA has below-average corporate services expenses as compared to other (services delivery organizations) and other jurisdictions nationally,” the MNP report said. The consulting firm even found that board members at the WRHA and Shared Health are underpaid and recommended they get raises to attract more qualified candidates. What the audits did find is that most health authorities have extremely poor budgeting practices, which is the main reason they run deficits almost every year. They routinely and deliberately underestimate costs and overestimate revenues in order to present government with a balanced budget at the beginning of the fiscal year. They also fail to take into account population growth and changing demographics. As a result, health authorities find themselves short of resources almost every year, the audits found. “Deficits impede the ability of organizations to make the best decisions for patient care, plan effectively for future health care needs and support front-line staff,” MNP wrote in one of its reports. “In addition, the ongoing deficits of the SDOs are incompatible with the government of Manitoba’s overall goal of a balanced summary budget by the end of its current term.” The reports made several recommendations on how to improve budgeting, including adopting more realistic revenue and expenditure projections, building contingencies into budgets (which, shockingly, they don’t already do) and using modern software instead of manual entries. “Shared Health lacks appropriate budgeting and forecasting software leading to resource intensive, manual budgeting processes and a lack of standardization,” MNP found. “Manual processes reduce time that can be devoted to investigative analysis to support operational decision-making, scenario analysis, and identifying efficiencies.” Also, many health authority board members don’t have financial backgrounds and struggle to provide proper oversight on budget matters, particularly at Shared Health, MNP found. “Given the complexities and financial oversight required, we found a majority of board members in key roles do not possess the necessary skills and experience to provide appropriate financial oversight,” the consulting firm wrote. It also recommended that health authorities adopt zero-based budgeting, where all expenditures are thoroughly evaluated every year, rather than using budget figures from previous years. The province’s immediate response to the audits was to announce new interim CEOs for both the WRHA and Shared Health. But it’s going to take a lot more than that to overhaul the financial culture at those organizations, many of which have been running deficits on and off for decades. Sweeping changes to how they budget and how they allocate resources are desperately needed to improve patient care. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Feb 7, 2025",Consulting firms; Budgets; Bureaucracy; Budgeting,Nom: Shared Health; NAICS: 516210,2025-02-07,Winnipeg Free Press

Terry Newman: Ontario NDP's 'housing first' plan for encampments would be a disaster,2025,"Wednesday, Marit Stiles, leader of the Ontario NDP, told Ontarians she will end the encampment crisis in Ontario - by forcing them to live like the rest of us. Sounds noble, except it's been tried before and has failed. Stiles fundamentally misunderstands how Ontarians end up in encampments in the first place, as if there's a direct line from losing one's home to living in a tent in a park. Encampments have risen in Canada for a number of reasons, the least likely of which is the lack of affordable housing, as Stiles believes. Evidence suggests it's mental health and substance abuse that are the major drivers of encampments across Canada. During her visit to the riding of Parkdale-High Park in Toronto, Stiles told Ontarians, ""The Ontario NDP will end the encampments by supporting people and by helping them find a home to live in."" She continued, ""How will we do it? We will support municipalities with their shelter and community housing costs, and we'll also undo the damage that was done when Liberals and Conservatives downloaded housing to cities. We'll get the government back to building supportive housing, that's a permanent home that has wrap-around support like mental health care or addiction support and more. We'll help with paying rent, to get people out of shelter and into homes quickly, and also free up more shelter space. And we're gonna prevent homelessness by increasing social assistance and protecting renters to keep more people in their homes to begin with."" When asked by a reporter what this would cost, Stiles did not provide an amount. She later told the crowd, ""The answer to the crisis is housing, right?"" As if asking the question before continuing and confirming her own assumptions, ""It's housing first."" Housing may be the neat and tidy issue Stiles would like to focus her campaign on, but like most things, the problem of encampments is far more complicated. Ontarians don't simply go from losing their home to living in a park. Stiles fundamentally misunderstands homelessness. In actuality, encampment-living is far more likely to be a result of addictions and mental illness than the lack of affordable housing. According to a 2020-2022 government survey of 26,000 of homeless in 87 communities across Canada, 61 per cent reported having substance use issues, 60 per cent reported having mental health issues, and 47 per cent reported having both. And the numbers for mental health and addiction for the homeless may be even higher. As the survey notes, it had an 87 per cent response rate. As we all know, mental health and addictions are still highly stigmatized, so it would not be surprising if that's one of the main reasons why 13 per cent chose not to respond. And while the relationship between mental health and substance abuse and homelessness can be bidirectional, in that someone could become homeless and then develop mental health issues and addictions, the latter situation is far less likely. In fact, only eight per cent of respondents reported neither mental health nor substance use issues as being the reason for their loss of housing. Does this sound like a ""housing first"" problem, Stiles? Common sense should tell most Ontarians that mentally-well Canadians who are not addicts don't typically fast-track to living in a tent. And if Stiles thinks those living in encampments can quickly adjust to shelters, community housing, or live on their own, paid for by themselves or government, she hasn't been paying attention. While this might work for some high-functioning residents, it's not likely to work for many with addictions and mental health issues, which are often combined. A good example of this is a failed San Francisco experiment where encampment members were put up in hotels. Rooms were destroyed, there was rampant illegal drug use and disorder, and, of course, having a hotel room did not stop people from dying from overdoses. In addition to mental health and addictions issues, some of those put up in the hotels had criminal backgrounds. Encampments are not well-functioning peaceful Smurf villages with individuals who can quickly transition to intermediate and regular housing, on the government dime or not. Another likely driver for the encampments and rising crime in Ontario and the rest of Canada is the process of ""deinstitutionalization"" which occurred across the country between 1960 and 1980. This meant that chronic mental health patients were discharged from institutions with beds, 24/7 care and supervision and suddenly became the responsibility of local community mental health services which were not equipped to handle them. This is the same reason why Stiles' claim that a permanent home with what she refers to as ""wrap around support"" is not likely to solve the problem either. Here's the issue, there will always be some individuals who will never be able to fully function in society and who are, frankly, dangerous to others and themselves. Some of these individuals need around-the-clock support and supervision. Unfortunately, they now slip through the cracks and end up on our streets and in our parks. Those who are not dangerous still may need the kind of support that can only be given in long term institutions. Those who are functional, but at risk of homelessness, would no doubt benefit from access to psychological and financial counselling as well as addictions services. As noted by social worker Ann Braden Johnson in her 1990 book on the American experience, Out of Bedlam: The Truth About Deinstitutionalization the movement was largely based on the flawed premise that the mentally ill, with the assistance of medication and community support, could return to a normal functioning life in society. And let's not fool ourselves, it was also about saving government money. This immediately put additional pressure on hospitals, community centres and police. Look around. Sound familiar? Ontario, and the rest of Canada, is experiencing an encampment crisis, and something does have to be done about it. But solving that crisis requires understanding the situation first. Stiles does taxpayers and those living in encampments no favours by putting forward a plan like this. My guess is that organizations that specialize in these issues will tell Stiles that this crisis is not, ""housing first,"" but ""mental health and addictions first,"" and I hope they shout it, loud and clear.

""I think Doug Ford was coming out from day one with plans on the back of a napkin and that worries me because we need a strong united approach."" The NDP leader said this is the time for change, adding that Ontario can't afford another seven years of Ford. ""Doug Ford has shown us who he is over and over again,"" Stiles said. ""He lies to the people of Ontario, turns around and says then something completely different every the time. I do not believe that he has shown that he has the interest of Ontarians at heart. Over and over again he makes bad deals for Ontario, he makes dirty deals that just benefit his friends and she us as well he'll make deals with big American corporations over Ontario companies often."" Some of the main topics she spoke to supporters about were food inflation, affordable housing, family doctors and the lack of support for post-secondary students. ""Strengthening our health -care system, strengthening our public services, our public education system, our post-secondary institutions,"" Stiles said. ""Thinking about that future workforce who are graduating. Ensuring that Ontario is tariff proof, so we are investing here. Things like an Ontario government Ontario first procurement plan."" When asked about affordable housing in Kingston, Stiles said a plan will be revealed soon. ""One of the things we are very committed to bringing back is real rent control,"" she said. ""We have to stop people from losing their homes in the first place, but we are also going to be putting forward the most ambitious plans. We've seen the provinces history to build more deeply affordable homes with lots of options for people."" Local NDP candidate Ugalde echoed that need, adding that the ability for him to buy a home at his age is unattainable. ""Frankly, I'm quite angry that me and none of my colleagues will never own a home,"" Ugalde said. He's hoping to bring down the cost of living for residents living in Kingston and the Islands. ""People are struggling,"" Ugalde said. ""The city declared a state of emergency saying that one in three households struggle with food insecurity. Thirteen-point-three per cent of our constituents live below the poverty line, the labour of federation estimates, and that's a disgrace."" In terms of health care, ""we want to implement more practice ready assessment programs to get internationally trained physicians that already reside within our constituencies on to the front line instead of having them compete for residency positions with Canadian medical graduates,"" said Ugalde. He also wants to hold Queen's University accountable. ""They claim to be running a deficit, but they have a better credit rating than many comparable midsized Ontario universities. And they are using this deficit as a justification to not pay their workers backpay in regard to Bill 124, which has already been struck down as unconstitutional. We want fiscal transparency from that institution and we want that university to pay their workers and negotiate fairly.""

Braid: NDP Leader Nenshi blasts Smith as a 'showboat' on tariff crisis,2025,"Many Albertans think Premier Danielle Smith has done a great job on the tariff crisis. NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi and his official Opposition are not among them. Nenshi says Smith is a ""showboat"" who plays the tariff crisis more for attention than effect. ""Premier Smith is obsessed with being the centre of attention, talking about what she's doing but not actually doing the work,"" Nenshi said in an interview Tuesday. ""It's fascinating that her story keeps changing, because she's desperately trying to take credit."" In a blistering critique, Nenshi said Smith loves to post photos of herself with U.S. leaders, but it's not clear she's actually meeting them and getting anything done. ""When she realizes something is about to happen, she jumps the gun and announces it first. She's done it a few times now, so something looks like it was her idea."" Nenshi doesn't give Smith any credit for the 30-day pause in tariffs ""Credit for what? We still have the Sword of Damocles hanging over us. ""We've gotten some small victories. But anybody taking a victory lap right now is making a terrible mistake, because we know that there's going to be a massive (economic) restructuring. ""Let's be very clear on what her strategy was. It was to promise Kevin O'Leary the world in return for an invitation to Mar-a-Lago. ""She believed that if she got to Mar-a-Lago and got her 30 seconds with President Trump, that she would charm him into abandoning his entire economic policy. ""It really doesn't sound like that was going to work, does it? ""At best, the border work will only delay what they (the Americans) are planning on doing anyway, and we have to make sure that we're ready for that."" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith poses with U.S. President Donald Trump and businessman Kevin O'Leary in Mar-a-Lago, Fla. Nenshi referred to U.S. demands for a complete makeover of Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade. Trump threatens 25 per cent tariffs on that issue, too. Smith has focused on U.S. complaints about the border. On Wednesday, she again backed appointment of a drug and border ""czar."" She plans more U.S. trips to influence legislators. Smith says immediate progress on the border is crucial to keep Trump from imposing tariffs after the 30-day pause. In this phase, she warns, any slacking off would mean tariffs, for sure. But she has never said that the further economic talks will not be extremely difficult. Smith warns against assuming the battle is already won. Related Danielle Smith renews call for federal election and better border security after meeting with Trudeau and premiers Braid: Trump is right, says Smith - our border, cartel funding are genuine problems for U.S. Nenshi also alleges she has often shifted her position on a tariff carve-out for oil and gas. ""When it became clear that there wasn't going to be a carve-out for oil and gas, she suddenly changed her story and said, 'I've never asked for a carve-out.' ""And when there was a carve-out vote, she said, 'See, it's because I asked for one.' Nothing she says on this is in any way credible."" Nenshi is still unelected but nominated as the NDP candidate in vacant Edmonton-Strathcona Smith gets to set the byelection date. The UCP hasn't yet picked a candidate for that byelection. The legislature opens Feb. 25. Nenshi might continue to be an outsider for the entire spring session. ""It's very clear they'll do everything they can to keep me out of the legislature, after spending the entire fall session complaining about me not being in the legislature."" The Alberta Legislature is pictured on Sunday, Nov. 10, 2024 in Edmonton. Nenshi notes that Smith calls constantly for a federal election and a functional Parliament, but doesn't seem interested in having an Opposition leader in her own parliament. ""The UCP used every trick in the book to try and win in Lethbridge, and it didn't work."" The NDP won vacant Lethbridge-West last Dec. 18. ""They'll use every trick again to try to confuse voters in Edmonton-Strathcona - and again, it won't work,"" Nenshi concludes. On Wednesday, the NDP excoriated the UCP for its informal connections to Take Back Alberta and leader David Parker, after they were hit with $120,000 in fines for violating financing rules ""Danielle Smith needs to immediately condemn the anti-democratic and illegal activities of Take Back Alberta,"" said NDP Deputy Leader Rakhi Pancholi. Alberta politics have taken a back seat to the tariff crisis lately. But the rivalries are as hot as ever.

Alberta NDP Leader Nenshi among those mourning Aga Khan's death,2025,"As with many Ismaili Muslims, Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi has felt the Aga Khan's presence long before meeting him. Nenshi said he has often navigated life using the moral compass of the principles of tolerance, pluralism and community that the Aga Khan stood for. So when Nenshi finally had the chance to meet the spiritual leader, his usual volubility dissolved into a state of bewilderment. ""Every time I met him, I ended up saying something foolish in the few seconds that I had with him, instead of something deeply profound,"" Nenshi said. Aga Khan IV died on Tuesday at the age of 88 He had held the spiritual leadership since he was 20. Nenshi still remembers the first time he saw the Aga Khan in Government House in Edmonton. ""I was quite nervous, and I remember I was wearing my dad's 1974 watch, and I looked down at the watch, and kind of took a deep breath and got inspiration from my father, who had recently passed at that time, and just sort of said to him a little bit about my family,"" Nenshi said. Nenshi thanked the Aga Khan for helping Ugandan refugees like his parents in the early 1970s to find refuge in Canada. ""He said to me something along the lines of, 'Not only did we choose Canada because of its pluralism, but we have worked hard to build that pluralism so that Canada can be an example for the world,'"" Nenshi said. ""And that has always stuck with me - that we have a very special role to play as Canadians in showing the world how people of different faiths can live purposeful lives together."" Aga Khan leader for most of his life Considered by his followers to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and treated as a head of state, he was a student at Harvard University in 1957 when his grandfather named him as successor to lead the diaspora of Shia Ismaili Muslims, passing over his playboy father and declaring his followers should be led by a young man ""who has been brought up in the midst of the new age."" Aga Khan IV returned to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania after his grandfather, Aga Khan III, became ill. Soon, his ailing grandfather unexpectedly made his grandson heir to the family's 1,300-year dynasty as leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect. Two weeks later, Queen Elizabeth bestowed on him the title of ""His Highness"". Aga Khan Prince Karim al-Hussaini in London, England, on Jan. 28, 2010. Over decades, the Aga Khan evolved into a business magnate and a philanthropist, moving between the spiritual and the worldly with ease. The Aga Khan Development Network, his main philanthropic organization, deals mainly with issues of health care, housing, education and rural economic development. It says it works in over 30 countries and has an annual budget of about $1 billion for nonprofit development activities. A defender of Islamic culture and values, he was widely regarded as a builder of bridges between Muslim societies and the West despite - or perhaps because of - his reticence to become involved in politics. The Ismailis - a sect originally centred in India but which expanded to large communities in East Africa, Central and South Asia and the Middle East - consider it a duty to tithe up to 12.5 per cent of their income to him as steward. Aga Khan last visited Calgary in 2018 The Aga Khan last visited Calgary in 2018 when about 20,000 people, mostly Ismaili Muslims from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba celebrated the leader's arrival in a series of gatherings. The University of Calgary later that year awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, the institution's highest academic honour. The University of Alberta has also named after him an 11-acre garden featuring secluded forest paths, wide, stepped terraces that change with the seasons, geometric stonework, fountains and water features that stream into wetlands, with an orchard surrounding the scenic Calla Pond. His Highness the Aga Khan with Chancellor Deborah Yedlin after receiving his honorary degree, Doctor of Laws, from the University of Calgary in 2018. Nenshi was walking out the door of his Calgary home when he heard a phone ring. His mother, who answered the phone, was left shaken. ""Because everything in her life, every major decision she's made in her life, has been guided by those principles and by his example,"" he said. Later that night, Nenshi was in Lethbridge and joined the city's small Ismaili community for a prayer. ""It was very important to me, and very special for me to be there with that community,"" he said.

NDP,2025,"Boycott all U.S. products, Singh urges Montrealers A3","Montreal Gazette; Montreal, Que.","Montreal, Que.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 5, 2025",,,2025-02-05,Montreal Gazette
Federal NDP Leader Singh urges Canadian shoppers to boycott U.S. products,2025,"Ottawa should not accommodate U.S. President Donald Trump's ""bogus"" claims of a fentanyl crisis at the border, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters at a Verdun grocery store Tuesday. He encouraged shoppers to ""boycott anything that's made in the United States"" as he selected Quebec and other Canadian products off the shelves at Chez Robin. Singh's comments came after an 11th-hour deal reached Monday between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paused threatened tariffs for 30 days. The agreement will see Canada appoint a ""fentanyl czar,"" list cartels as terrorist organizations and launch a ""Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force"" against organized crime. It follows a previous federal commitment to spend $1.3 billion on border security. ""The crisis that was raised by Donald Trump is absolutely bogus,"" Singh said. ""There is no credible threat of illicit drugs flowing from Canada to the United States."" Less than one per cent of the fentanyl entering the United States comes from Canada. Still, the NDP leader said he supported beefing up border security - not to protect the U.S. from Canadian contraband, but to protect Canadians from firearms and drugs smuggled in from the United States. ""We should be protecting our borders from the illicit materials that come from the States to Canada,"" Singh said, rather than focusing on fentanyl crossing in the other direction. Singh was joined by independent Montreal councillor Craig Sauvé. Before speaking to reporters, the pair walked through the grocery store in front of the cameras, picking out Canadian cheese, maple syrup and kefir, among other products. ""Buying Canadian is a part of our fight back against these tariffs,"" Singh said. ""It's something we should always have been doing, but making that decision now in the face of tariffs will strengthen our local economies."" The buy Canadian approach should extend to government, the leader said, with federal public contracts awarded to ""Canadian companies that hire Canadian employees,"" especially unionized employees. Yielding to Trump is the wrong approach, Singh said. ""Donald Trump is a bully and the only thing that works against bullies is strength. ""He is attacking our sovereignty,"" he added, referencing the U.S. president's repeated suggestion that Canada become the country's 51st state. With the tariff time bomb now reset to 30 days, Singh said Ottawa should use the time to craft a response designed to ""hurt"" the president. ""We need to target (Trump's) allies, like Elon Musk,"" he said, suggesting that Canada go after the Tesla billionaire by cutting off exports of the critical minerals needed for electric vehicles. Singh said he agreed with the retaliatory tariffs that would have kicked in Tuesday had Trump and Trudeau not come to an agreement. He reiterated his call for Parliament to return to legislate a tariff response. Trudeau asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament at the beginning of January, when he announced his resignation. Sittings are only set to resume March 24, following the Liberal leadership race. Though the NDP, Conservatives and Bloc Québécois have all pledged to bring down the government when Parliament resumes, Singh has said that a tariff response package could take priority should MPs return to Ottawa sooner. ""We need to have a package in place for workers that might be impacted"" by the tariffs, he said, criticizing the government for having ""no real clear plan"" for those who might lose their jobs in a potential trade war. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is also calling for Parliament to resume in response to the tariff threat.","Montreal Gazette; Montreal, Que.","Montreal, Que.","Wilson, Jack",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 5, 2025",Leadership; Parliaments; Fentanyl; Border security; Grocery stores; Tariffs,,2025-02-05,Montreal Gazette
NDP pledges school repairs,2025,Stiles makes campaign stop in city A2,"The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 5, 2025",,,2025-02-05,The Ottawa Citizen
"Stiles unveils $830M school repair program; NDP argue Conservatives have not only ignored the issue, but have made it worse",2025,"Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles delivered a broad education platform on Tuesday that was long on criticism of Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford, but short on details about how she would fund her plan. If elected in the upcoming provincial election, the NDP would spend $830 million a year for 10 years to clear the repair backlog in schools, said Stiles, who unveiled her education platform at Maison de la Francophonie d'Ottawa. The NDP would also hire more teachers and other education workers, end the practice of streaming, invest in francophone education and French-immersion programming in the English system as well as fixing student transportation funding. Ontario's schools have a massive repair backlog that has grown under Ford's government, Stiles said. ""Right now our schools are literally falling apart,"" she said, flanked by NDP candidates running in Ottawa ridings. ""We have a $22.3-billion repair backlog that was left behind by the Liberals and was allowed to grow and fester and grow again by Ford."" Stiles also promised a universal food program for schools. Last year in the federal budget, the government announced $1 billion over five years for a national program to provide meals for up to 400,000 more children every year beyond those served by existing school food programs. ""Ontario is the only province that hasn't signed on to the federal program, and I think that's shameful at a time when food bank use is up,"" Stiles said. ""We can ensure that kids focus on their teachers, not their hunger. And, of course, we're going to use Ontario-grown food."" Much of Stiles' criticism about school underfunding has been underlined in recent reports. In December, the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario concluded that it will cost $21.7 billion over the next 10 years to clear the repair backlog and maintain schools in states of good repair, plus another $9.8 billion to build new schools. Meanwhile, many school boards are facing deficit budgets this year and are scrambling to cut costs by the end of the year. Trustees at the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board heard last week, that despite passing a balanced budget for this school year, the board was facing a deficit of $4.2 million and must find between $17 million and $20 million in savings to balance its 2025-26 budget. Provincial funding is not expected to increase and won't address inflationary, replacement or special education pressures, the trustees heard. ""The cost of education has gone up, but we have not actually increased education (funding) at the same rate,"" said Stiles, who was a Toronto District School Board trustee from 2014 until 2018. ""It's a giant hole in our education budget, and our children are seeing the impact of that every day. Fewer education assistants, bigger class sizes, fewer supports."" But Stiles offered no explanation as to where the NDP would find the money to fulfil the promises, except to say that, if she became premier, her government would review and revise the education funding formula used to calculate allocations to each school board based on the number of students as well as funding for specific needs. No government has addressed the funding formula in years, Stiles said. ""Our education is funded right now on a formula that (addresses) bums in seats as opposed to student needs,"" she said. ""That tells you a lot of what this government's priorities are. It's all about the numbers. It's not about the kids' needs."" As for figuring out the priorities, that's a challenge because ""everything is on fire in our education system,"" said Chandra Pasma, the NDP's Ottawa West-Nepean candidate, who was the party's education critic for the past two and a half years. ""Certainly, we need to provide the supports that our kids need,"" she said. ""That starts with making sure there are education workers who are there every single day, bringing down class sizes, helping children who have disabilities or special needs, making sure that the needs of every child are met, making sure that schools are a safe place for kids to be every single day."" Stephen Skoutahan, president of the Ottawa Carleton unit of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, said much of the NDP platform aligned with his members' concerns, particularly around special education funding, which would help address violence in the classroom. ""When students and their needs aren't met, they become violent and dysregulated in the classroom,"" he said.","The Ottawa Citizen; Ottawa, Ont.","Ottawa, Ont.","Laucius, Joanne",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 5, 2025",Special education; Francophones; Food; Cost control; Budgets; Funding; Class size; School boards; Elections,,2025-02-05,The Ottawa Citizen
Province to launch new disability program for those able to work; NDP critic Renaud accuses government of trying to remove people from AISH,2025,"Alberta announced a new disability program Tuesday that will provide financial and health support to those with disabilities who are able to work. The Alberta Disability Assistance Program (ADAP) will not be replacing the existing Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) program, which will remain in place for those with severe disabilities that prevent them from working more hours due to benefits being clawed back. However, the province said those on AISH may be moved to ADAP starting in 2026 if they are deemed more suited to the new program. Seniors, Community and Social Services Minister Jason Nixon announced the program on Tuesday morning, saying the program is intended to ensure those with disabilities are not negatively affected by having a job. ""I want Albertans who are currently on AISH to know that there is no risk of them not receiving disability supports. In the future, this will be about which of these two programs is the best spot for them based on their circumstance. But they will be receiving one of those disability programs long term,"" Nixon said. Beginning in July 2026, there will be one combined application for both AISH and ADAP. According to officials, the application will have two parts. The first part will be asking for personal information, and the second part is a medical assessment that must be filled out by a medical professional. The province plans to create a ""pre-qualified"" list of medical professionals who are more accessible to applicants to complete the comprehensive medical assessment. In addition, there will be a new review panel made up of medical professionals who will approve applications. The government has yet to reveal the financial details for the new program or the criteria for ADAP and said it is still finalizing the level of benefits that will be available under the new program. There are approximately 77,000 Albertans who are currently on AISH. Nixon said 13 per cent of them, about 10,000 people, are currently working. Nixon said those who are on AISH will be placed in the program ""best suited to their unique situation."" Unlike AISH, those with disabilities under the new program will be able to earn more money without losing access to benefits. According to the province, ADAP was created to address concerns from Albertans who are on AISH but due to clawbacks from working, are unable to earn more than the specified limit without losing some of their income support. ""We are taking every step we can to make sure nobody falls through the cracks,"" Nixon said. The province said a person on AISH can earn up to $1,072 per month. The province will claw back 50 per cent of every additional dollar earned up to $2,009. Those earning more than $2,009 will have 100 per cent of income support clawed back. Families can earn up to $2,612 per month with no deductions, and $2,612 to $3,349 is 50 per cent exempt for families. Nixon said the new program will offer employment supports including career planning, resume assistance, simulated work sites and supportive job placements. ""We know there are qualified individuals who can do the job well that often just need a little bit of support. We know that employers in our province have responded to that well when we work with them and I fully anticipate that Alberta employers again will rise to that challenge when they see the opportunity that we're presenting and the fact that the government is dealing with some of the big hurdles, like health benefits."" Nixon said. Those who are currently on AISH will be receiving further details in March. Alberta NDP community and social services critic Marie Renaud said Tuesday the province's decision to reassess current AISH recipients is ""alarming"" and said the UCP is not interested in changing the ""overall picture of employment"" for those with disabilities. ""It's galling to hear the minister talk about how this program will be transparent when none of the other disability support programs have any degree of transparency,"" Renaud said. ""The UCP government has no plan to identify, remove and prevent barriers to employment for people with disabilities, all they have is a plan with no details to remove people from AISH."" The Alberta Union of Provincial Employees said the new program will only add more chaos to a system that is already in ""disarray."" AUPE vice-president Sandra Azocar voiced her concerns in a news release Tuesday over the announcement's lack of funding plans and how the new program will be resourced and staffed. ""People with disabilities are tired of waiting to be assessed and to get support. Some have been waiting for more than two years because the government has instituted a freeze on handling new applications. The government has axed the jobs of dozens of case workers and is refusing to fill vacant positions,"" Azocar said. ctran@postmedia.com X: @kccindytran","Calgary Herald; Calgary, Alta.","Calgary, Alta.","Tran, Cindy",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 5, 2025",Professionals; People with disabilities; Disability; Employment; Families & family life,Nom: United Conservative Party of Alberta; NAICS: 813940; Nom: Alberta Union of Provincial Employees; NAICS: 813930; Nom: New Democratic Party-Alberta Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-02-05,Calgary Herald

"NDP wants Canada-first procurement policies; Gretzky, Masse say country needs to go on the offensive after Trump's threats",2025,"With a potential trade war threatening to plunge the economy into chaos, federal and provincial NDP members in Windsor want Canada to immediately ban U.S. companies from government contracts. Windsor West MP Brian Masse and Windsor West MPP Lisa Gretzky, who is on the campaign trail, held a media conference on Monday calling for Canada ""to go on the ofef nsive"" with policies that favour domestic companies. Late Monday U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to pause his tariffs for 30 days. But before the reprieve, Masse said that even if tariffs are avoided this time, the long-standing dependency on American trade and goodwill will continue to make Canada vulnerable. ""We're going to continue to have Trump threaten these things,"" he said. ""So we're saying these are the types of things, the tools that we have access to right away, that we should be exercising."" ""And banning Americans from participating in the procurement should be the first thing, because they've actually done it to us with 'Buy American.'"" U.S. President Donald Trump declared a trade war on his closest allies over the weekend, signing his threats of 25 per cent tariffs against Canada and Mexico into reality. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately hit back, imposing similar tariffs on American products. The tariffs were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, though Trump agreed to hold off for at least 30 days after Canada and Mexico made several commitments to improve border security. MP Irek Kusmierczyk (L Windsor-Tecumseh) could not be reached for comment on Monday. But Gretzky and Masse said efforts to protect the Canadian economy must go beyond tit-fortat tariffs. They also want provincial and federal governments to favour Canadian companies in bid selection processes, increase Canadian content requirements in contracts and prioritize the use of Canadian materials such as steel and lumber. Gretzky said it's not feasible for Canada to eliminate all reliance on other countries, but increasing self-reliance is vital to be ready for turbulent times. Government procurement should be, ""first and foremost, made in Windsor, made Ontario, made in Canada,"" she said. ""You would have thought we would have learned that during the pandemic, but nothing has been done provincially to actively future proof our economy and protect jobs,"" she said. ""It shouldn't have taken the threat of the American president and the political whim of whoever happens to be in power over there. We should have already been future proofing. We should have made sure we were investing in local producers, local workers and local manufacturing to the maximum degree."" Premier Doug Ford did announce Monday in the midst of his election campaign that the Ontario government would ban U.S. companies from provincial contracts until the tariffs are removed. He also said Monday the province would rip up a $100-million contract with Starlink, the satellite internet company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is the head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Gretzky called Ford's announcements political opportunism. ""He has a history of subsidizing very wealthy companies, foreign companies, taking contracts away from Ontario or Canadian companies and giving them to American companies or to Austrian companies,"" she said. ""When there is a Canadian option or Ontario option that's what they should be doing. And he doesn't have a history of doing that."" If the tariffs materialize, Masse said there also needs to be more attention focused on helping border communities, ""which are going to have increasing complications more than anywhere else."" In Windsor, he said that could mean providing support to operate the Windsor-Detroit tunnel if revenues drop due to a prolonged trade war and declining Canadian dollar. ""There's where federal support would be appropriate to make sure that infrastructure is preserved for the long term and the city's residents aren't punished, making sure the infrastructure is at its highest level of accountability and continues to be the link that we need it for the future,"" said Masse.

JACK LAYTON ANNOUNCES HE HAS CANCER,2025,"Jack Layton’s aides were shaken. Their boss, the leader of the federal New Democrats and a man known for his commitment to physical fitness, was announcing he had prostate cancer. To some outsiders, the whole thing may have seemed overdramatic. Mr. Layton, who revealed his illness at a specially arranged news conference in Toronto, had been diagnosed months earlier. His father had been successfully treated for the same disease. And no, he wouldn’t be stepping down as party leader, just taking a little time off for treatment. It seemed obvious he would recover. And he did – rallying to lead his party to Official Opposition status a year later when Quebeckers embraced him en masse as “un bon Jack.” But less than four months after that election he was gone – taken by a different, undisclosed type of cancer.

Ontario NDP leader unveils $830-million plan to clear school repair backlog,2025,"Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles delivered a broad education platform on Feb. 4 that was long on criticism of Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford, but short on details about how she would fund her plan. If elected in the upcoming provincial election, the NDP would spend $830 million a year for 10 years to clear the repair backlog in schools, said Stiles, who unveiled her education platform at Maison de la Francophonie d'Ottawa. The NDP would also hire more teachers and other education workers, end the practice of streaming, invest in francophone education and French-immersion programming in the English system as well as fixing student transportation funding Ontario's schools have a massive repair backlog that has grown under Ford's government, Stiles said. ""Right now our schools are literally falling apart,"" she said, flanked by NDP candidates running in Ottawa ridings. ""We have a $22.3-billion repair backlog that was left behind by the Liberals and was allowed to grow and fester and grow again by Ford."" Stiles also promised a universal food program for schools. ""We can ensure that kids focus on their teachers, not their hunger. And, of course, we're going to use Ontario-grown food,"" she said. Much of Stiles' criticism about school underfunding has been underlined in recent reports. In December, the Financial Accountability Office of Ontario concluded that it will cost $21.7 billion over the next 10 years to clear the repair backlog and maintain schools in states of good repair, plus another $9.8 billion to build new schools. Meanwhile, many school boards are facing deficit budgets this year and are scrambling to cut costs by the end of the year. Trustees at the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board heard last week, that despite passing a balanced budget for this school year, the board was facing a deficit of $4.2 million and must find between $17 million and $20 million in savings to balance its 2025-26 budget. Provincial funding is not expected to increase and won't address inflationary, replacement or special education pressures, the trustees heard. ""The cost of education has gone up, but we have not actually increased education (funding) at the same rate,"" said Stiles, who was a Toronto District School Board trustee from 2014 until 2018. ""It's a giant hole in our education budget, and our children are seeing the impact of that every day. Fewer education assistants, bigger class sizes, fewer supports."" But Stiles offered no explanation as to where the NDP would find the money to fulfill the promises, except to say that, if she became premier, her government would review and revise the education funding formula used to calculate allocations to each school board based on the number of students as well as funding for specific needs. No government has addressed the funding formula in years, Stiles said. ""Our education is funded right now on a formula that (addresses) bums in seats as opposed to student needs,"" she said. ""That tells you a lot of what this government's priorities are. It's all about the numbers. It's not about the kids' needs."" NDP Leader Merit Stiles makes an education announcement in Ottawa on Tuesday. As for figuring out the priorities, that's a challenge because ""everything is on fire in our education system,"" said Chandra Pasma, the NDP's Ottawa West-Nepean candidate, who was the party's education critic for the past two and a half years. ""Certainly, we need to provide the supports that our kids need,"" she said. ""That starts with making sure there are education workers who are there every single day, bringing down class sizes, helping children who have disabilities or special needs, making sure that the needs of every child are met, making sure that schools are a safe place for kids to be every single day."" Stephen Skoutahan, president of the Ottawa Carleton unit of the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario, said much of the NDP platform aligned with his members' concerns, particularly around special education funding, which would help address violence in the classroom. ""When students and their needs aren't met, they become violent and dysregulated in the classroom,"" he said. ""A dollar spent in the classroom gets a $7 return. But we're not going to see that return in two, three or four-year terms of public office. We're going to see it in 20 years. We have to make that commitment."" Food insecurity in schools is a real problem, said Jennifer Duncan, the unit's third vice-president. ""Kids who are hungry are not focused and primed for learning,"" she said. ""We used to have breakfast programs in schools, but they are continually underfunded and fewer and fewer schools qualify to have these breakfast programs."" The province needs to take a serious look at funding for student needs, not numbers of students, Duncan said. ""I think (Stiles) had the right focus. There weren't a lot of details in the announcement,"" she said. ""I'd like to see more details.""

"Boycott anything made in the U.S., Jagmeet Singh says in Montreal",2025,"Ottawa should not accommodate U.S. President Donald Trump's ""bogus"" claims of a fentanyl crisis at the border, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters at a Verdun grocery store Tuesday. He encouraged shoppers to ""boycott anything that's made in the United States"" as he selected Quebec and other Canadian products off the shelves at Chez Robin. Singh's comments came after an 11th-hour deal reached Monday between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paused threatened tariffs for 30 days. The agreement will see Canada appoint a ""fentanyl czar,"" list cartels as terrorist organizations and launch a ""Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force"" against organized crime. It follows a previous federal commitment to spend $1.3 billion on border security. ""The crisis that was raised by Donald Trump is absolutely bogus,"" Singh said. ""There is no credible threat of illicit drugs flowing from Canada to the United States."" Less than one per cent of the fentanyl entering the United States comes from Canada. Still, the NDP leader said he supported beefing up border security - not to protect the U.S. from Canadian contraband, but to protect Canadians from firearms and drugs smuggled in from the United States. ""We should be protecting our borders from the illicit materials that come from the States to Canada,"" Singh said, rather than focusing on fentanyl crossing in the other direction. Singh was joined by independent Montreal councillor Craig Sauvé. Before speaking to reporters, the pair walked through the grocery store in front of the cameras, picking out Canadian cheese, maple syrup and kefir, among other products. ""Buying Canadian is a part of our fight back against these tariffs,"" Singh said. ""It's something we should always have been doing, but making that decision now in the face of tariffs will strengthen our local economies."" The buy Canadian approach should extend to government, the leader said, with federal public contracts awarded to ""Canadian companies that hire Canadian employees,"" especially unionized employees. Yielding to Trump is the wrong approach, Singh said. ""Donald Trump is a bully and the only thing that works against bullies is strength."" ""He is attacking our sovereignty,"" he added, referencing the U.S. president's repeated suggestion that Canada become the country's 51st state. With the tariff time bomb now reset to 30 days, Singh said Ottawa should use the time to craft a response designed to ""hurt"" the president. ""We need to target (Trump's) allies, like Elon Musk,"" he said, suggesting that Canada go after the Tesla billionaire by cutting off exports of the critical minerals needed for electric vehicles. Singh said he agreed with the retaliatory tariffs that would have kicked in Tuesday had Trump and Trudeau not come to an agreement. He reiterated his call for Parliament to return to legislate a tariff response. Trudeau asked the Governor General to prorogue Parliament at the beginning of January, when he announced his resignation. Sittings are only set to resume March 24, following the Liberal leadership race. Though the NDP, Conservatives and Bloc Québécois have all pledged to bring down the government when Parliament resumes, Singh has said that a tariff response package could take priority should MPs return to Ottawa sooner. ""We need to have a package in place for workers that might be impacted"" by the tariffs, he said, criticizing the government for having ""no real clear plan"" for those who might lose their jobs in a potential trade war.

Mulcair: Canada needs a Plan B to respond to Trump's wake-up call,2025,"Donald Trump may have done Canada a favour with his blustery pronouncements about us becoming the 51st state. Canadians reacted with uncharacteristic but understandable anger when he attacked us, as if we were players in his reality television show. While I'm not a big fan of booing the American national anthem at a Toronto Raptors game, I do understand the exceptional circumstances that led to it. Trump's bullying behaviour will have a lasting, negative effect on one of the world's most successful economic and security partnerships. The Canada-U.S. relationship has endured for more than 150 years, through thick and thin. In many ways, it's been a model for the world. Trump's destructive, self-gratifying bombast has done anything but push us into the waiting arms of the American empire. It has been a wake-up call for all Canadians. We need to begin the hard work of solidifying our economic and security links with other partners, Europe first among them. An independent Canadian foreign policy has become as essential for our sustained future as an independent environmental policy. Against the backdrop of the Trump tariffs show, the Wizard of Weird, Elon Musk, has been busy wreaking havoc on the entire U.S. administration. Canadians should be equally concerned about the implications of that. As bizarre as it sounds, Musk has sent in a brigade of unaccountable underlings to ransack the computer systems at the U.S. Treasury and access a trove of the most confidential information about Americans and U.S. businesses, many of which compete with Musk. This wanton spoliation of the data in the U.S. Treasury could have a catastrophic effect on both the economy and security of the United States. Trump, seemingly unable to recognize threats to democratic institutions, sees a billionaire doing whatever he wants and evidently agrees. While Trump has named highly capable secretaries to head the State and Commerce departments, Marco Rubio and Howard Lutnick are the exceptions that confirm the rule. And chaos and incompetence look to be the rule. The most shocking case in point, of course, is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's hard not to have some pity for him as he stumbles through his confirmation process, clearly illustrating that he has neither the expertise nor the experience for the job. He'd be in charge of health policy and research in the United States. It's terrifying to even think about, but on his watch, the world's most advanced work to find cures for rare diseases could come to a grinding halt. Trump's manoeuvres have had the positive effects of concentrating Canadians' attention on his potential next move - and we should begin to prepare a Plan B for life on this continent. Trump has sent clear signals, both during the campaign and since, that he wants access to Canada's water for the parched American South. Jean Chrétien wisely included in NAFTA the right to ban bulk water exports. Trump will be gunning for that as he begins to renegotiate our current trade deal. Trump also makes it clear that he would like to do away with Canada's supply management system for dairy, eggs and poultry. That system is integral to Canada's food supply. While it flies in the face of some economic theories, it actually works. Canadian farms tend to remain family-owned, resisting the trend to industrial agriculture. Trump says it's unfair and Canadians should prepare for another battle. The upheaval wrought by Trump's return has affected all aspects of Canada's political life. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre looks like he doesn't know which way to turn. His own brand of populist rhetoric seems to have lost its charms. In Quebec, Parti Québécois Leader Paul St.-Pierre Plamondon was roundly criticized on social media for seeming to side with Trump on border issues. It's been two weeks. Imagine four years!

'Banning Americans' - NDP wants Canada-first government contract policies,2025,"With a potential trade war threatening to plunge the economy into chaos, federal and provincial NDP members in Windsor want Canada to immediately ban U.S. companies from government contracts. Windsor West MP Brian Masse and Windsor West MPP Lisa Gretzky, who is on the campaign trail, held a media conference on Monday calling for Canada ""to go on the offensive"" with policies that favour domestic companies. News later broke Monday evening that U.S. President Donald Trump has agreed to pause his tariffs. But before the reprieve, Masse said that even if tariffs are avoided this time, the longstanding dependency on American trade and goodwill will continue to make Canada vulnerable. MP Brian Masse is shown at the downtown Windsor riverfront on Monday, February 3, 2025 where he held a press conference regarding proposed U.S. tariffs. ""We're going to continue to have Trump threaten these things,"" he said. ""So we're saying these are the types of things, the tools that we have access to right away, that we should be exercising."" ""And banning Americans from participating in the procurement should be the first thing, because they've actually done it to us with 'buy American.'"" U.S. President Donald Trump declared a trade war on his closest allies over the weekend, signing his threats of 25 per cent tariffs against Canada and Mexico into reality. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately hit back, imposing similar tariffs on American products. The tariffs were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, though Trump agreed to hold off for at least 30 days after Canada and Mexico made several commitments to improve border security. MP Irek Kusmierczyk (L - Windsor-Tecumseh) could not be reached for comment on Monday. But Gretzky and Masse said efforts to protect the Canadian economy must go beyond tit-for-tat tariffs. They also want provincial and federal governments to favour Canadian companies in bid selection processes, increase Canadian content requirements in contracts, and prioritize the use of Canadian materials such as steel and lumber. Gretzky said it's not feasible for Canada to eliminate all reliance on other countries, but increasing self-reliance is vital to be ready for turbulent times. Government procurement should be, ""first and foremost, made in Windsor, made Ontario, made in Canada,"" she said. ""You would have thought we would have learned that during the pandemic, but nothing has been done provincially to actively future proof our economy and protect jobs,"" she said. ""It shouldn't have taken the threat of the American president and the political whim of whoever happens to be in power over there. We should have already been future proofing.

The NDP used to be the party of labour. What happened?,2025,"Professor of history at Concordia University and author of the forthcoming book The Left in Power: Bob Rae’s NDP and the Working Class With the Ontario and federal elections on the way, we will soon see if working-class voters in Canada are turning to the populist right. That is certainly the case in other countries. The recent U.S. election saw a major class realignment as those without a college degree overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. So did union households. Will we see something similar play out here? Canadian politics of course differs from the U.S. in many respects. One obvious difference is that we have a social-democratic party that has been historically anchored in the working class in some regions of the country. Founded in 1961, the New Democratic Party brought together the remnants of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, an older socialist party born during the Great Depression, with its greatest strength in the Western provinces, and the Canadian Labour Congress. Modelled on the British Labour Party, the NDP had a formal link with organized labour, whereby trade unionists were represented at all levels of the party. Union locals could vote to formally affiliate, paying dues to the party, and in return send delegates to party conventions. It was once the party of “ordinary Canadians.” The alliance with organized labour was strongest in Ontario, where 200,000 of the 275,000 trade unionists affiliated with the party in 1992 lived and worked. Thus, when the Ontario NDP under Bob Rae unexpectedly won the provincial election in September, 1990, it was a government like no other. The new minister of labour, Bob Mackenzie, who represented the riding of Hamilton East, left school after Grade 7 to work in the merchant marine fleet. Next door, David Christopherson left school in Grade 9 to work at a local factory. Both men got their real education in the union movement. Then there was Toronto’s Frances Lankin, one of Mr. Rae’s strongest cabinet ministers, who had been a guard in a male prison. They were not alone. Fully 40 per cent of the governing NDP caucus were trade unionists. By contrast, there were only five lawyers in a caucus of 74. For Ontario’s political, business and media elites, however, the collective profile of the new government was unnatural, even laughable. As a result, soon after the election, media pundits and opposition members took to calling the ragtag NDP caucus the “Clampetts,” from The Beverly Hillbillies, a popular American sitcom from the 1960s about a poor extended family of uneducated dimwits who strike it rich and move into a mansion in California. It was an analogy dripping in class condescension. Those days now feel like a lifetime ago. There are few workingclass people in today’s NDP provincial and federal caucuses. You could say that the party has gentrified. Its connection to the labour movement is far more tenuous. You could also say that the Rae government was the beginning of the end of the NDP as a workingclass party. On the one hand, it saved Ontario manufacturing operations like Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie and the Spruce Falls paper mill in Kapuskasing – which continue to operate today. It also passed anti-scab legislation and bravely tried to soften the blow of the radical restructuring of Ontario’s economy after trade liberalization and free trade. On the other hand, the Rae government’s slide into austerity politics led it to abandon the promise of public auto insurance, which had considerable symbolic value, and forcibly reopened public-sector collective agreements in its so-called “Social Contract.” The move effectively shattered the government’s relationship with much of the labour movement and almost did the same with the party itself, prompting mass resignations and union disaffiliations. In fact, the party’s Ontario provincial membership collapsed from 31,791 members in 1992 to 14,674 in early 1994. It was a disillusioning experience for many. While some private-sector unions, like the Steelworkers, remained committed to the NDP, the Canadian Auto Workers, now Unifor, largely cut its ties to the party. Despite this, the Ontario NDP has remained relatively strong in its old union bastions of Windsor, Hamilton and Northern Ontario, but there are signs that this coming election may be different. One only needs to look to Northern B.C. to see how former NDP heartlands can be lost. Now more than ever, the NDP needs to reconnect with workingclass voters and repair its relationship to the trade-union movement. This means providing an economic alternative to the other parties.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","High, Steven",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 3, 2025",Primaries & caucuses; Provincial elections; Working class; Voters; Political parties,,2025-02-03,The Globe and Mail
"As NDP targets tolls, is war on cars over?",2025,"Before the Ontario election campaign had officially kicked off, NDP Leader Marit Stiles announced a big policy plank. This is usually when parties set out a defining message, the kind of thing they want voters to associate with them for the rest of the campaign. What would the NDP present as a signature issue? Health care? Housing? Education? Road tolls. Specifically, the removal of them. ""It's time we put some money back in the pockets of Ontarians, and got them home to their families faster,"" Stiles said in declaring that she would remove the tolls on Highway 407 as premier. Leaving aside the questionable feasibility and extraordinary cost of such a plan - the privately owned highway north of Toronto is by some estimates worth more than $30 billion - it is notable that the most progressive of the main parties at Queen's Park wants, as one its first acts, to eliminate road pricing. In the early days of Doug Ford's political rise, back when he was mostly a sidekick to his late brother, the pair used to make great hay out of the ""war on cars."" They opposed surface-level transit, bike lanes, road tolls, anything that would be perceived as an inconvenience to drivers. Non-drivers be damned. The NDP's anti-toll position is the end of that fight. The war on cars is over. The cars won. To be fair to Stiles, she's not the first NDP leader to recoil at tolls, even though the idea behind them, to encourage the use of public transit and other more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, are the kinds of things that are normally championed by progressives. Andrea Horwath, her predecessor at Queen's Park, complained about even the smallest of toll projects, such as the brief stretches of highway in Toronto's west end that are free to high-occupancy vehicles but tolled for single drivers. Horwath decried them as ""Lexus lanes,"" never seeming to quite get the point that allowing willing drivers to pay to use those lanes benefited the drivers on the rest of the road. Horwath's rival at the time, then-premier Kathleen Wynne, was all over the public record as supporting road pricing as a way to ease gridlock and fund transit. But she repeatedly bailed on the idea, first by rejecting the advice of expert panels on traffic and transit that she convened, and later by blocking the request of Toronto city council to put tolls on the Don Valley Parkway and Gardiner Expressway. (Her first slip into Fordian car-first politics came years earlier, when she backed the wildly expensive Scarborough subway extension to save a byelection campaign.) Over more than a decade when the Ontario Liberals were in power, the same Liberals that got rid of coal-fired power plants and protected the Greenbelt for environmental reasons, only former mayor John Tory, a conservative, truly supported road tolls. Which is the funny thing about tolls. They can be supported by parties of the right, because they are market-based and impose costs only on users, or by parties of the left, because they discourage pollution. The Liberals, as business-friendly environmentalists, ought to love them. But, no. Given many chances, the Liberals have veered away from tolls. And when the NDP begins its campaign by essentially waving a More Free Roads banner, that battle is lost. Premier Ford would sooner wear a ""Canada Is For Sale, Actually"" hat than put a toll on a highway, so committed is he to the pro-car bit. Even in his fever dream of a 50-kilometre tunnel under Highway 401, he's firmly opposed to the idea that the road's users pay a fee for the privilege. Tolls are an impediment to drivers, like bikes and pedestrians, and Ford won't have that. He is, at least, consistent. It's just a surprise that the party on the opposite side of the political spectrum has so fully embraced his way of thinking. Scott Stinson is a journalist based in suburban Toronto.

"Sask. NDP must change narrative on health; If party can't offer better alternatives, it must accept its lack of rural MLAs",2025,"It's been more than 30 years since the NDP last elected an MLA from west central Saskatchewan. It's been 18 years since the party elected an MLA anywhere in rural Saskatchewan. Chalk it up to the massive shift in the politics of rural voters. But also chalk it up to long memories about the critical issue of rural healthcare delivery. For the umpteenth time, the Sask. NDP this week raised a serious problem in rural health delivery - based on real-life tragedy and tangible evidence demonstrating rural communities are being shortchanged on services. ""As resources are being pulled from Kindersley, Unity and even Alberta, wait times are rising, putting patient lives at risk,"" said NDP health critic Vicki Mowat, citing recent closures in Wilkie and problems with ambulance services in Kerrobert. ""What we're seeing consistently is closures across the west-central area. We see a pattern of this government not providing recruiting and retention of health care workers."" Even the most strident rural Sask. Party supporter would acknowledge health care is a problem. It was evident three years ago when angry Kamsack residents confronted then rural and remote health minister Everett Hindley and former MLA Terry Dennis over declining health-care services. The numbers further suggest that the Opposition's concerns are real. Over a four-year period, 789 days of ""service disruptions"" were recorded, involving temporary closures of emergency care or diagnostic laboratory or radiography, according to data the NDP obtained through the freedom of information process. This is a reality in rural Saskatchewan, reinforced most every day - either by those involved in health-care delivery or through anecdotal stories from people with the misfortune of enduring a serious health crisis and encountering a health system that's falling short. The NDP's latest concerns came after last week's CTV Saskatoon story by Laura Woodward over a family's concerns following the November death of 71-year-old Roger Ogram. After a serious accident near Alcurve, Ogram died in an ambulance when it was rerouted to North Battleford because closer Lloydminster did not have weekend staff to operate its CT scan. ""Health care in Lloydminster is encountering considerable difficulties stemming from resource shortages across various sectors, most notably insufficient staffing,"" wrote Kristine Weisbeck, a Lloydminster-area patient advocate and first responder, in a letter read by NDP rural and remote health critic Meara Conway on Wednesday. Conway then took square aim at local west-central MLAs Kim Gartner (Kindersley-Biggar), James Thorsteinson (Cut Knife-Turtleford) and Colleen Young (Lloydminster) for not uttering a ""peep"" about the area's problems in health care. It seemed a gratuitous political cheap shot that underscores how the NDP still isn't being heard anywhere in rural Saskatchewan - partly because of the history of rural health care delivery. If this is about politics, it's worth noting that the three Sask. Party MLAs Conway cited won their seats by an average 3,785 votes last October, and that the closest the NDP came to any rural seat was Yorkton, which it still lost by 1,239 votes. Obviously, the very real concerns about rural health care haven't made a dent. Why? It all goes back to what happened more than 30 years ago when the former NDP government in 1993 ""converted"" 52 rural hospitals to health-care centres. Of course, NDP partisans will be quick to call this ancient history. But Saskatchewan rural folks have very long memories. And 789 days of closures at specific ""health centres"" don't seem to resonate as much with rural voters as permanent closures of 52 hospitals 30 years ago. The lore of 1993 rural hospital closures is right up there with disdain for the name ""Trudeau."" And nothing in the NDP's 2024 platform convinced rural voters that a Carla Beck government would offer anything better. This larger NDP caucus has to start doing something to change the narrative. It needs a better rural healthcare plan and it need to sell it in individual rural communities.

"Sask. NDP must change narrative on health; If party can't offer better alternatives, it must accept its lack of rural MLAs",2025,"It's been more than 30 years since the NDP last elected an MLA from west central Saskatchewan. It's been 18 years since the party elected an MLA anywhere in rural Saskatchewan. Chalk it up to the massive shift in the politics of rural voters. But also chalk it up to long memories about the critical issue of rural healthcare delivery. For the umpteenth time, the Sask. NDP this week raised a serious problem in rural health delivery - based on real-life tragedy and tangible evidence demonstrating rural communities are being shortchanged on services. ""As resources are being pulled from Kindersley, Unity and even Alberta, wait times are rising, putting patient lives at risk,"" said NDP health critic Vicki Mowat, citing recent closures in Wilkie and problems with ambulance services in Kerrobert. ""What we're seeing consistently is closures across the west-central area. We see a pattern of this government not providing recruiting and retention of health care workers.""

"'We are going to fight like hell'; NDP Leader chastises Ford, vows to stand up to U.S. over tariffs",2025,"Provincial NDP Leader Marit Stiles stopped by a Windsor union hall Friday to promise that her government would ensure income protection for Ontario workers if U.S. President Donald Trump makes good on his tariff threats. Stiles did not get into specifics about her plan to protect workers if Trump imposes a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods - possibly on Saturday - but she said ""you must never, ever back down from bullies."" ""I'm going to make sure that protections are in place,"" said Stiles. ""I'm not giving up yet. We are going to fight like hell for every single job and every single sector in this province. I'm reminded when I'm here in Windsor that we rely on the United States. Yes, our economy is reliant on that, but they rely on us too, and we're going to fight back hard in a strong, unified way with all levels of government."" The Unifor union hall on Turner Road, where PC Leader Doug Ford made a visit earlier in the week, was Stiles' second stop on her campaign tour of Windsor-Essex. She was joined by Windsor West incumbent Lisa Gretzky, Windsor-Tecumseh candidate Gemma Grey-Hall, Essex candidate Rachael Mills, and a crowd of union members cheering behind her. Stiles said an NDP government would also protect and support the EV industry, including the large sector gaining steam in Windsor-Essex. ""I am 100 per cent behind the EV strategy and the sector,"" she told reporters. ""That was a strategy that was built by the working people here in Windsor and across this province. We don't want to negatively impact that at all. We will continue to stand strong and protect that sector."" She was also scheduled to make a stop in Windsor West on Friday before heading to Sarnia. Stiles started out her Windsor-Essex visit Thursday night in Harrow, where she painted a picture of a province where people are struggling with the rising cost of living and cuts to services. ""After seven long years of Doug Ford, life is harder than it's ever been. The cost of everything - housing, groceries - is through the roof,"" Stiles said at the Beerded Dog pub to a room full of boisterous supporters that included Essex candidate Mills. ""Our kids are struggling. Our education workers are struggling in schools and nobody can find a family doctor. ""Our emergency rooms are shut, our hallways and our hospitals are full of patients. This is life in Doug Ford Ontario."" When it comes to fighting new U.S. trade tariffs threatened by Trump - the reason Ford gave for calling an early election - Stiles said the Tory leader isn't up to the task. ""I don't think Doug Ford could negotiate his way out of a paper bag,"" she said, citing her own labour background as providing her with the readiness to face down Trump. ""I have a history bargaining, negotiating big national collective agreements where I negotiated higher wages, better working conditions, good jobs for so many workers up against big American multinational corporations. ""What we need right now is a strong united plan, a strong united team, and what we're getting is Doug Ford and a whole bunch of plans on the back of a napkin."" Later, in an interview with the Star, she questioned Ford's ideas, including his suggestion that Canada negotiate a new trade deal with the U.S., separate from Mexico, rather than renegotiate the existing continent-wide CUSMA agreement. ""I'm really concerned a lot of the ideas that he's thrown out there, cutting out Mexico."" Asked if she agreed with Ford's suggestion of retaliatory measures that could include cutting electricity exports to the U.S., Stiles said retaliatory tariffs may be necessary. ""We'd be working with all levels of government to come in (with) a unified approach, with possibly retaliatory tariffs,"" she said. ""But I'm really concerned right now that what Doug Ford will do is, he will pit sector against sector. Here in Windsor-Essex ... you've got the auto industry, you got agriculture. I haven't heard him talk one bit about the agriculture sector yet."" Stiles did not explain how an NDP government would protect agricultural jobs. On Wednesday, the first day of campaigning, she promised a program to protect the incomes of people affected by the tariffs. In attacking the Tory government's record, Stiles also cited Ford's Greenbelt plan in which developers purchased protected lands ahead of the province opening them for development, greatly increasing their value. That decision, now subject to an RCMP investigation, was reversed after a public outcry. Stiles also criticized the Ford government's decision to lease part of publicly owned Ontario Place waterfront lands to an Austrian firm to build a huge spa. The lease runs for 75 years with an option to extend it another 20 years. After strongly criticizing Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie on the first day of the campaign, Stiles didn't mention her in public comments at her Harrow stop. She urged campaign supporters to get out the vote and ""flip Essex back from blue to orange."" Currently held by Progressive Conservative Anthony Leardi, who took 51 per cent of the vote in the 2022 election, the Essex riding was held by the NDP's Taras Natyshak for three terms, from 2011-2022, and before that by Liberal Bruce Crozier from 1999-2011. Mills, a talent acquisition consultant, environmental advocate and a member of the Essex affordable housing task force, said she liked what she heard from Stiles at the Campaign stop. ""I believe that her vision for this province is what we need, affordability, health care, education, environmental aspect is extremely important to me as well,"" she said.

"Tories set record in 2024:   Party's $41.8M nearly doubles Liberal, NDP total",2025,"The federal Conservative party had a banner fundraising year in 2024, when it nearly doubled the combined total collected by the Liberals and NDP by raising almost $41.8 million. The Conservatives brought in nearly $12.8 million in the final quarter of 2024, according to filings with Elections Canada. The party said that $7.6 million of that sum was raised in December alone. In all of 2024, the Liberals raised about $15.2 million and the NDP took in close to $6.3 million in donations. Average individual donations for all three parties were less than $200. The Conservatives recorded 211,000 donors, with an average contribution of around $198. The Liberals received donations from more than 118,000 people who gave $128 on average and the NDP saw almost 60,000 donors chip in an average of $105 each. The fourth quarter of 2024 was the most successful fundraising quarter for all three major national parties, with the Liberals and NDP both seeing about one third of their annual donations coming in during this period. In an emailed response, Liberal party spokesperson Parker Lund said the party is off to a strong start in 2025, having already achieved its ""best-ever"" January for grassroots fundraising. The party was asked what that total was but has not yet replied. Lund added that more than 400,000 Liberals have registered to take part in the leadership vote on Mar. 9, and more than 100 people reached out this month to run in the next election. The Conservatives say they broke all fundraising records with their 2024 haul, including the record for most successful quarter with the $12.8 million raised in the fourth quarter of last year. The Conservatives said the ""incredible generosity"" of Canadians shows leader Pierre Poilievre's message is resonating and that people want an election now. The NDP's national director Lucy Watson said in an emailed reply their donations are driven by people ""giving what they can"" and the party saw its ""strongest"" digital fundraising day in party history on Dec. 31, 2024. She added the NDP is ready to run a ""strong election campaign."" The House of Commons reconvenes on March 24 and the governing Liberals will quickly face a confidence vote with their throne speech.

NDP government gets failing grade on teachers,2025,"Chesterton’s Fence principle warns against destroying a fence before examining why it was built in the first place. In October, the Manitoba government disregarded this principle by eliminating all core subject requirements for teacher certification without proper consideration. Pre-service K-8 teachers were required to take two courses each of English/French, math, science and history/geography and all teachers were required to have a teachable major from a list of subjects taught in schools. The Kinew government’s stealthy change demolished these requirements, ushering in the most sweeping changes to teacher certification since the late ’90s. Throughout the process, the narrative pushed by the government and outspoken proponents has proven to be false, self-serving, misleading and lacking crucial details. Internal documents obtained by Free Press reporter Maggie Macintosh reveal serious flaws with the process. Only a small group of insiders was consulted and the slides shared with them contain inaccuracies and a biased narrative. For example, assertions that Nova Scotia will eliminate subject requirements for teacher certification are false. Quebec, Canada’s top-performing province, with the strictest requirements, is conspicuously absent from the analysis, as is Ontario’s math certification test for teachers. Despite the flawed process, the documents show there was not broad support for the sweeping changes. Rather, some of those consulted preferred to maintain the status quo and others advocated for increasing subject requirements. In June, the education department’s recommendation was to reduce, not eliminate, subject requirements and to maintain teachable majors for high school teachers. Mysteriously, by October, the proposed moderate model was abandoned. The government ignored the recommendation, took the approach of “how low can we go,” and made the radical decision to eliminate all teacher subject requirements. This is an egregious way to make policy decisions. Playing limbo with standards for teachers is no way to run an education system. The backlash was swift. Subject-area experts, parents and concerned citizens signed petitions and criticized the government’s decision. Some education professors defended the decision in the Free Press , claiming it was research-based. Tracy Schmidt, then acting minister of education, parroted these claims. Alongside six colleagues, with expertise in math, research methods and education, we fact-checked the claims against research articles provided by one education professor and found none supported them — some even contradicted them. We sent our publicly available report to all provincial MLAs. The government has yet to respond. Further attempts to reassure the public ensued, with proponents spreading the false narrative that K-8 pre-service teachers are being forced to take advanced courses like calculus. This ignores the specialized math courses thoughtfully developed by math departments for them. Additionally, the public was misinformed that education faculties will teach prospective teachers core subjects. Pedagogy courses are not substitutes for math, English, history or science courses and it is unreasonable to assume that education professors are qualified to teach those subjects in depth. If you wanted to understand how the periodic table works, would you ask a chemistry professor or an education professor? Instead of dismissing subject-area experts, the government and education faculties should value their expertise to teach those disciplines. The claim that the changes align Manitoba with other provinces is also false. Manitoba now has the weakest teacher preparation requirements in Canada. Some have argued that the certification requirements failed to produce higher student scores, so they should be removed. By that logic, we may as well eliminate seatbelt laws because accidents still happen. If anything, this underscores the need to strengthen subject requirements. After all, you can’t teach what you don’t know. Obviously, a minimum requirement for effective teaching is having a solid understanding of the subjects you teach. The government claims it wants to remove barriers to enter the teaching profession, but lowering standards comes at a dreadful cost to Manitoba students. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds, whose parents cannot afford tutoring to compensate for teachers with limited subject knowledge, will be most affected. Returning to Chesterton’s Fence: why were subject requirements introduced? Unlike the Kinew government’s approach, they stemmed from extensive consultation and a 1996 government-commissioned report by Bernard Shapiro, who stressed the importance of content knowledge. He recommended certifying teachers based on their subject expertise, calling it “unconscionable” and “an affront to the professionalism of teachers” that school boards can appoint a teacher to any position without regard for their area of expertise. The subject requirements were a good-faith compromise to address his recommendations and our government has made a grave error in dismantling them. The process was dishonest and irresponsible. Kinew’s policy will put undertrained teachers in the classroom and leave them to flounder. He must reverse this. Restore core subject requirements and give our teachers and students the support they need.

In attacking the Tory government's record, Stiles also cited Ford's Greenbelt plan in which developers purchased protected lands ahead of the province opening them for development, greatly increasing their value. That decision, now subject to an RCMP investigation, was reversed after a public outcry. Stiles also criticized the Ford government's decision to lease part of publicly owned Ontario Place waterfront lands to an Austrian firm to build a huge spa. The lease runs for 75 years with an option to extend it another 20 years. After strongly criticizing Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie on the first day of the campaign, Stiles didn't mention her in public comments at her Harrow stop. She urged campaign supporters to get out the vote and ""flip Essex back from blue to orange.""

Mills, a talent acquisition consultant, environmental advocate and a member of the Essex affordable housing task force, said she liked what she heard from Stiles at the Campaign stop. ""I believe that her vision for this province is what we need, affordability, health care, education, environmental aspect is extremely important to me as well,"" she said.

Mandryk: Sask. NDP need to offer better rural health-care alternative,2025,"It's been more than 30 years since the NDP last elected an MLA from west central Saskatchewan. It's been 18 years since the party elected an MLA anywhere in rural Saskatchewan. Chalk it up to the massive shift in the politics of rural voters. But also chalk it up to long memories about the critical issue of rural health-care delivery. For the umpteenth time, the Saskatchewan NDP this week raised a serious problem in rural health delivery - based on real-life tragedy and tangible evidence demonstrating rural communities are being short-changed on services. ""As resources are being pulled from Kindersley, Unity and even Alberta, wait times are rising, putting patient lives at risk,"" said NDP health critic Vicki Mowat, citing recent closures in Wilkie and problems with ambulance services in Kerrobert. ""What we're seeing consistently is closures across the west-central area. We see a pattern of this government not providing recruiting and retention of health care workers."" Even the most strident rural Sask. Party supporter would acknowledge health care is a problem. It was evident three years ago when angry Kamsack residents confronted then-rural and remote health minister Everett Hindley and former MLA Terry Dennis over declining health-care services. The numbers further suggest that the Opposition's concerns are real. Over a four-year period, 789 days of ""service disruptions"" were recorded, involving temporary closures of emergency care or diagnostic laboratory or radiography, according to data the NDP obtained obtained through the freedom of information process. This is a reality in rural Saskatchewan, reinforced most every day - either by those involved in health-care delivery or through anecdotal stories from people with the misfortune of enduring a serious health crisis and encountering a health system that's falling short. The NDP's latest concerns came after last week's CTV Saskatoon story by Laura Woodward over a family's concerns following the November death of 71-year-old Roger Ogram. After a serious accident near Alcurve, Ogram died in an ambulance when it was rerouted to North Battleford because closer Lloydminster did not have weekend staff to operate its CT scan. ""Health care in Lloydminster is encountering considerable difficulties stemming from resource shortages across various sectors, most notably insufficient staffing,"" wrote Kristine Weisbeck, a Lloydminster-area patient advocate and first responder, in a letter read by NDP rural and remote health critic Meara Conway on Wednesday. Conway then took square aim at local west-central MLAs Kim Gartner (Kindersley-Biggar), James Thorsteinson (Cut Knife-Turtleford) and Colleen Young (Lloydminster) for not uttering a ""peep"" about the area's problems in health care. It seemed a gratuitous political cheap shot that underscores how the NDP still isn't being heard anywhere in rural Saskatchewan - partly because of the history of rural health care delivery. If this is about politics, it's worth noting that the three Sask. Party MLAs Conway cited won their seats by an average 3,785 votes last October, and that the closest the NDP came to any rural seat was Yorkton, which it still lost by 1,239 votes. Obviously, the very real concerns about rural health care haven't made a dent. Why? It all goes back to what happened more than 30 years ago when the former NDP government in 1993 ""converted"" 52 rural hospitals to health-care centres. Of course, NDP partisans will be quick to call this ancient history. But Saskatchewan rural folks have very long memories. And 789 days of closures at specific ""health centres"" don't seem to resonate as much with rural voters as permanent closures of 52 hospitals 30 years ago. The lore of 1993 rural hospital closures is right up there with disdain for the name ""Trudeau."" And nothing in the NDP's 2024 platform convinced rural voters that a Carla Beck government would offer anything better. This larger NDP caucus has to start doing something to change the narrative. It needs a better rural health-care plan and it need to sell it in individual rural communities. If they can't do this, perhaps the NDP should accept that we won't see a rural NDP MLA for quite a while. Mandryk is the political columnist for the Regina Leader-Post and the Saskatoon StarPhoenix.

"Parliament needs to resume: Singh; NDP leader echoes tories' calls to get back to work, but still plans to help topple liberals",2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is calling on the Liberals to recall Parliament and work with opposition leaders on a potential support package for workers who could be hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs as early as Saturday. Singh, who on Thursday spoke at an event with union leaders in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., said he wanted to be ""really clear"" that his intention to vote non-confidence in the minority Liberals when Parliament resumes at the end of March remains the same. He said that date is still weeks away but in the meantime if there are ways to fight back against Trump's threat of tariffs and deliver support to affected Canadians, ""let's do it."" ""We need to let these workers know 'we got your back,' and so I'm calling on Parliament to be recalled so that we can put in place those protections,"" Singh said. ""If there's any legislation required to actually put in place supports for workers, let's get that done."" Gov. Gen. Mary Simon granted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's request to sus - pend Parliament until March 24, which he did to give the Liberal party room to hold a leadership contest to replace him, after announcing on Jan. 6 he would step down as both party leader and prime minister. The Liberals will name their new leader on March 9. On Wednesday, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson confirmed the government was looking at how it might be able to support people hit by Trump's potential tariffs. If it needs legislation to do it and the opposition parties are willing to work with them, the Liberals would consider recalling Parliament, the minister said, adding he believes those conversations are premature. Singh on Thursday pointed out that Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also called on Parliament to be recalled. ""Let's call it back and get something done to support these workers,"" Singh said. The federal Conservatives have not said whether they would support the government in passing any new legislation designed to deliver tariff-related financial support, as the party did when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March 2020. That legislation saw the Liberals send tens of billions over two years to businesses shuttered by lockdowns and individuals who had lost their jobs. Both Singh and Poilievre have said the Liberals must be willing to retaliate should Trump make good on his threat of slapping 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, who is in Washington meeting with Republican lawmakers and Trump officials, said she conveyed during a meeting on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that should Trump proceed, Canada would retaliate and ""everything was on the table."" She was set to be joined in Washington on Thursday by Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who is trying to sell Trump officials on Canada's new plan to beef up border security, including by targeting the flow of the deadly drug fentanyl. Trump has demanded Canada take action against fentanyl making its ways into the United States through the Canada-U.S. boundary and against migrants who cross illegally, under threat of having 25 per cent tariffs slapped on Canadian goods. Trump has made a similar threat to Mexico. Canadian officials have said the U.S.'s border with Mexico is the main problem and that less than one per cent of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes from Canada. Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Commerce Department, said during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday that the threat of tariffs is directly tied to concerns about fentanyl and immigration, saying the countries could avoid them if the U.S sees them taking action. ""As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff. And if they don't, then there will be,"" Lutnick said.

Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives raised record-setting $41.7-million in a year:   The party has long outpaced the Liberals and NDP in fundraising as they gear up for a looming federal election,2025,"Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party raised a record-setting amount of money in 2024, newly-released financial records show. The party brought in $41.7-million in 2024, the most they have ever raised, according to Elections Canada. Of that, $12.8-million came in the final four months of the year, a period marked by major upheaval in federal politics. During that time, the NDP ended their supply-and-confidence agreement with the Liberals, placing the minority government back in a precarious state. Behind the scenes, Liberal MPs began agitating for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quit, the Bloc Québécois also pulled their support of the government and Parliament itself was paralyzed by a procedural fight. Then, in mid-December, Mr. Trudeau suffered a major blow when his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, quit on the day she was to deliver the fall economic statement. That month, the Conservatives say they raised $7.6-million – even with the Canada Post strike hindering the fundraising efforts of all non-profits. ""The incredible generosity of hard-working Canadians to the Conservative Party of Canada is directly correlated to the growing movement and resonance of Pierre Poilievre’s common sense message and promise to put Canada first,"" the party said in a statement accompanying the release of fundraising numbers Friday. The Conservatives have long outpaced their rival parties in fundraising. The Elections Canada filings show the Liberals as raising $5-million in the final four months of 2024, for a year-end total of $15.2-million. The NDP’s totals were not yet public on Friday morning. The Liberals are now in the midst of a leadership race. In a press release late Thursday night announcing their membership totals, the party said this past month has been their best-ever January for fundraising. Those figures won’t be available until the end of the first quarter of 2025.

"'There will be an election in the spring,' Singh says:   NDP leader renews vow to topple Liberals",2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh vowed Thursday to force a spring election at the end of March, when Parliament is scheduled to return. But even as he doubled down on his pledge to help topple the Liberal government, Singh called on that government to recall Parliament early to work on legislation to prepare for a possible tariff war with the United States. ""We will be voting against the government at the end of March,"" Singh said at a news conference in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. He repeated that line several times when pressed by journalists on the tight timeline. Singh has been calling for Parliament to reconvene early to rush through supports for workers who would be affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened 25 per cent tariffs. ""We will be voting against the government and there will be an election in the spring,"" he said. ""But before that time, there will be two months. Is the Liberal government proposing that we do nothing for two months?"" All three main opposition parties have said they intend to bring down the government in a confidence vote at the earliest opportunity. Parliament is currently prorogued until March 24 as the Liberals choose a new leader to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party continues to lead in national polls, has also demanded that Parliament return immediately as Canada faces down Trump's threats. Singh stood with union leaders and unionized steelworkers Thursday morning to announce an NDP ""Buy Canadian"" policy to respond to Trump's threat of economically damaging tariffs. Singh said Canada should overhaul its procurement rules and bar American companies from all federal government procurement contracts if Trump follows through on his tariff threat. ""We need to make sure that we're favouring Canadian companies that produce the things that we need in our own country,"" Singh said. Just before the 2019 election, Singh called for changes to federal procurement rules to force the government to buy more of what it needs from Canadian firms. Liberal leadership candidate Chrystia Freeland also pitched a ""Buy Canadian"" plan earlier this week. She said Ottawa should bar Americans from nondefence-related government procurement contracts in response to Trump's tariffs.

NDP commits to defeating Liberals,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has again pledged to defeat the government by the end of March, as the Liberals tried to make the case for the New Democrats to give them a lifeline through to the fall to strike pharmacare agreements and deal with the U.S. tariff threat. At a press conference in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., on Thursday, Mr. Singh walked back comments he made earlier this week when he opened the door to the NDP once again supporting the Liberals in the minority Parliament. “We will be voting against the government at the end of March,” Mr. Singh said repeatedly in response to several questions about his evolving position. “We will be voting against the government at the end of March. Please ask me again, because I’ll repeat that again.” He argued that before then the New Democrats could work with the Liberals to create a tariff relief package. He did not explain, however, how legislation could be finalized before the U.S. clarifies what its tariffs against Canada will cover – or when the tariffs will be put in place. “I’m demanding that the Liberal government call back Parliament. Let’s put before Parliament a package to protect workers, support workers that are impacted by these tariffs,” Mr. Singh said. The Conservatives have also requested a return of the House before prorogation ends on March 24. A government official said Thursday there is no plan to recall the House earlier. The Globe and Mail is not identifying the official who was not permitted to disclose the plans. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump repeated his pledge to levy 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian goods beginning on Saturday. On Wednesday, his Commerce Secretary nominee suggested they could be avoided, while another phase of tariffs could still come after April 1. In an interview prior to Mr. Singh’s press conference, Health Minister Mark Holland argued against a spring election, citing the looming trade war. He also said the government needs more time to finalize its bilateral pharmacare agreements with provinces and territories. The country’s pharmacare law is the product of a now-defunct agreement between the Liberals and New Democrats that saw the NDP prop up the minority government in exchange for policy concessions. Mr. Holland said Ottawa is now “very close” to striking the deals but needs more time. “If we have until October, then we can get every deal done,” he said. “To me, it makes no sense to, for the sake of a few months, throw away the opportunity to get these pharmacare deals done.” Last June, however, Mr. Holland said his objective was for the drugs to be covered and available to Canadians by April 1 of this year. Bill C-64, the legislation allowing the government to strike the pharmacare deals, received royal assent on Oct. 10. Asked Thursday about the April goal to see contraceptives and diabetes medication available to Canadians, Mr. Holland said the government is “moving as fast as we possibly can.” “There’s a lot of things happening in the world right now, that are trying to pull our attention in lots of places,” he said. “But people’s health is too important to lose sight of.” A memorandum of understanding is already in place between Ottawa and British Columbia. B.C. agreed to enter formal discussions with the federal government to publicly fund the medications and treatments, once Bill C-64 received royal assent. In a letter sent to Mr. Holland on Wednesday, Mr. Singh and NDP health critic Peter Julian called on the minister to finalize the pharmacare agreements, along with the expansion of a separate dental care program. “Your government has all the legislation, and the funding needed to keep its promises on dental care and pharmacare now,” the letter said. “There will be no more time to get this done.” In a statement Thursday, Mr. Julian called Mr. Holland’s new comments a “Liberal ploy.” “They are willing to withhold birth control and insulin to buy more time for their new leader. It’s cynical,” he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Jan. 6 he would resign after the Liberals elect a new leader. That vote will take place on March 9 and the winner will also become prime minister. All the major opposition parties have pledged to defeat the Liberals when the House returns on March 24. Joss Reimer, the president of the Canadian Medical Association, said every physician knows of patients who cannot afford their medications, which means they may opt to take half doses or not take those medications at all. “The sooner we can get these agreements signed, the better chance they have at surviving whatever the political winds may bring,” Dr. Reimer said. Conservatives did not support the Liberal government’s legislation on pharmacare. During a debate in the House of Commons last fall, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said he rejected a single-payer drug plan, calling it “radical.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Walsh, Marieke; Kirkup, Kristy",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 31, 2025",Press conferences; Agreements; Legislation; Dental care; Prime ministers; Tariffs; Political parties; Federal elections-Canada; Health insurance,Nom: Liberal Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940; Nom: New Democratic Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-01-31,The Globe and Mail

Trudeau named MacKinnon as government house leader after Karina Gould left the role to campaign in the Liberal leadership race. His office has not yet said whether it has reached out to any opposition leaders. At a campaign stop in Ottawa, Gould said she would ""absolutely"" support reconvening Parliament to deal with the threat of tariffs if the need emerges. ""We have to make decisions based on the needs of the country at the time."" A spokeswoman for former finance minister and deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, another contender in the race, said that ""as a sitting Member of Parliament,"" the Toronto MP is ""ready to work with Parliament and all political parties to fight Donald Trump and to fight for Canada."" A response has not yet been returned from Mark Carney, the perceived front-runner in the race who does not hold a seat. Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, who is member of Trudeau's cabinet team assigned to Canada-U.S. relations, confirmed the government was looking at how it might be able to support people hit by Trump's potential tariffs through existing programs and resources.

"Terry Newman: Ontario Liberals, NDP try to make it a health-care election",2025,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford officially launched his re-election campaign in Windsor, Wednesday in front of the Ambassador Bridge. Standing at the podium in front of a ""Protect Ontario"" sign, he told the crowd that he couldn't imagine a better place to start his campaign than the manufacturing city. He asked the people of Ontario for ""their trust"" and for a ""strong stable four-year mandate to do whatever it takes"" to protect the province. The entire campaign kick-off was focused on Trump's potential tariffs. Ford also mentioned priorities such as cutting red tape and streamlining approvals to ""get big things built fast"" and ""fighting the job-killing Liberal carbon tax."" At no point in his campaign launch speech did Ford mention Ontario's crisis in health care. Ford did, however, respond to a reporter's question about his progress on health care. The Progressive Conservative leader described a $1.8 billion plan to connect every person to a family doctor. He added that when he took office, ""health care was an absolute disaster,"" and that since his government has added more medical schools and seats, registered more than 15,000 doctors, added 100,000 more nurses, and he pointed out that 30,000 more students get their education paid for if they practice in needed areas. He told the crowd that his party is spending $50 billion on hospital sites across the province and putting $33 billion more in health-care funding than any other government in the history of Ontario. However, critics complain it still hasn't been enough. The Ontario Medical Association issued a statement Wednesday stating ""the shortage of doctors in Ontario has shown no improvement in the past year,"" urged action, and provided an alarming list of 2,600 physician vacancies across the province. While Ford is keen to play to his strengths and campaign on fighting the tariff threat from the U.S., recent public opinion polls suggest he could be underestimating the importance of health care to voters. An Abacus survey released Wednesday showed that directly below the top concern for Ontarians - cost of living at 60 per cent - is improving the health-care system overall at 40 per cent. Ford may need to be clearer and more ambitious about his plans to fend off the opposition, who are eager to make the campaign more about health care, over pushing back against the threat of tariffs. Right out of the gate, Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie launched her campaign in Barrie on Wednesday, centring her speech around health care. She approached the podium which read, ""More doctors for you. Team Bonnie."" She wore a white hat with the slogan ""Real leaders fix healthcare."" She was accompanied by Dr. Rose Zacharias, a family doctor who will be running in Barrie where 55,000 people do not have a family doctor. Zacharias told the audience that nearly three million Ontarians do not have family doctor. Crombie told the crowd that her party has a four-year plan aimed at creating 3,100 doctors in family medicine and team care that will cost as much as the $200 pre-election cheques, referring to Ford's taxpayer rebates. Crombie's plan sounds ambitious, but it lacks the specificity required to convince Ontarians she isn't just making more empty political promises. NDP Leader Marit Stiles' podium simply read, ""Marit Stiles for premier."" Her speech was vague when it came to policies. Stiles suggested that a vote for her was a vote to ""protect working families against the threat of tariffs,"" to ""hire more doctors"" to ""build more homes,"" to ""fix schools"" to ""make life more affordable."" She promised the crowd a strong income protection program to take care of them if Trump's tariffs go through. She told the crowd that health care would be a focus of her campaign, but didn't provide details in her speech. And when pressed by a reporter, Stiles responded with a vague, ""We're going to be focused on making life better... hiring doctors... building homes... fixing schools and making life more affordable for Ontarians."" Crombie's Liberals currently sit at 24 per cent while Stiles' NDP are hovering at 19 per cent according to a recent Abacus poll, both trailing well behind Ford's PC's at 47 per cent. While the Ontario election has been called under unique circumstances, the outcomes of two other provincial elections show just how important health care can be once a campaign is underway. Ambitious clear plans that and strong rhetoric that focused on improving provincial health care no doubt tipped the scales in favour of both Tim Houston's Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives and Susan Holt's New Brunswick Liberals' campaigns last year. Promises to ""Go like hell,"" to get health care fixed were part of Tim Houston's approach in Nova Scotia. And it paid off. He told his team: ""Go as fast as you can to get this fixed. If there's any hurdles in your way, let me know. If it requires legislation, let me know."" Houston was very specific. He met with colleges, universities, associations and the health leadership across the province. When pressed for details, Houston told CBC's Katie Simpson that his plans were to make sure pharmacists can do more in terms of scope, to stop turf wars in the system, to improve emergency room services, patient care, training, retention, recruitment, and to do it, he brought all stakeholders together for their input. His incumbent government wasn't only re-elected, but gained popularity, jumping nine seats from 34 to 43. Likewise, a complete health-care system overhaul was a major part of Susan Holt's winning approach in New Brunswick. She promised to establish and support 30 community care clinics, increase the time emergency rooms are open, invest in modern technology, improve the compensation model for physicians, and offered retention bonuses for nurses. Again, specific and ambitious. Her party jumped 15 seats from 16 to 31. Neither Crombie nor Stiles's plans are quite as ambitious or specific as Houston's and Holt's were, but it's still early. And, they have the added benefit of not already being the incumbent whose governed over a health-care system on life support for nearly seven years. Ford has come out with guns blazing ready to fight tariffs with his ""Canada is not for sale"" cap, and he is riding high on goodwill generated from the leadership role he has played in recent months, advocating for Canada against the Americans. But Ford didn't have to call this election only two-and-a-half years into his term, and doing so may annoy those who support him, but his support may persist, largely because the two opposition leaders leave much to be desired. If Ford ignores health care, in favour of positioning himself as negotiator of Trump's tariffs, he may do so at his peril.

Ontario election 2025: What you need to know to vote; The Sudbury and Nickel Belt ridings are now held by the NDP,2025,"After several weeks of hints, allegations and things left unsaid, Ontario PC Leader Doug Ford finally made it official Tuesday afternoon, kick-starting the official process for a Feb. 27 election. For those into ceremony, Ford asked Lt.-Gov. Edith Dumont to agree to the election call. That set off the Writs of Election, the formal documents governing Ontario's 124 ridings. Elections Ontario is the unaffiliated board that oversees all elements of the campaign. Greg Essensa has served as Chief Electoral Officer since 2008. While the official news arrived Tuesday, the parties have been running campaign-like TV and radio ads for months, trumpeting themselves and bad-mouthing their rivals. WHY CALL AN ELECTION NOW? After winning a majority in the previous election on June 2, 2022, Ford and the ruling Progressive Conservatives weren't required to return to the polls until 2026. Ford, however, says he needs a new mandate ""a strong, stable, four-year mandate -to outlive the risksposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his threat to impose 25-per-cent tariffs on all Canadian goods. To maintain a majority, the Conservatives need to win at least 63 seats. Liberal leader Bonnie Crombie, NDP leader Marit Stiles and Green leader Mike Schreiner have all said an election now is an unnecessary waste of money. On Wednesday, Essensa said the election would cost approximately $189 million. A voting guide will be mailed to every household in the province between Feb. 6-12. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2022 ELECTION? The PC's won a resounding 83 of 124 seats, with a popular vote of 40.8 per cent. The NDP claimed 31 seats and 23.7 per cent of the voting share. Interestingly, while the Liberals claimed a higher popular vote than the NDP (23.8 per cent), they won only eight seats. That election hardly excited the masses. The biggest disappointment of all was the fact that only 44.06 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots - the lowest turnout in Ontario election history. In 2018, when Ford won his first Ontario election, 57 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots. The vote count will be intriguing, considering that the federal Liberals are currently undergoing their own leadership campaign, which will then be followed be a national election. WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS IN THE ONTARIO LEGISLATURE NOW? The PC's currently have 79 members in the provincial parliament, followed by the NDP at 28 and the Liberals at nine. There are six Independents and two Green party members. WHEN DID THE OPP OSITION PARTIES CHANGE THEIR LEADERS? The huge PC victory in 2022 spurred changes in the opposition ranks. Stephen Del Duca, who headed the Liberals in that election, has since been replaced by Crombie, a former Mississauga mayor who won the leadership in December 2023. Marit Stiles took over as NDP leader in February 2023, succeeding Andrea Horwath, who headed the party during the 2022 election. WHAT ARE THE RIDINGS IN THE SUDBURY AREA AND WHO CURRENTLY HOLDS THE SEATS? Algoma Manitoulin - Michael Mantha, a former NDP MPP now running as an Independent Nickel Belt - France Gelinas, NDP Sudbury - Jamie West, NDP WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST THE SUDBURY AREA'S INCUMBENT MPPS? Algoma Manitoulin - Bill Rosen- berg for the PCs, Reg Niganobe for the Liberals. Nickel Belt - Randy Hazlett for the PCs. The Liberals and Greens do not yet have a candidate. Sudbury - Max Massimiliano for the PCs and Dave Sylvestre for the None of the Above Party. The Liberals and Greens do not yet have a candidate. WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE? Everyone who is 18 years old, lives in Ontario and holds Canadian citizenship. Most eligible voters will receive voter information cards (VIC) in the mail. They are expected to arrive in mailboxes between Feb. 17-22. The VIC includes details about what district to vote in and the site of the local election office. In order to vote, one piece of valid ID is necessary. The Elections Ontario website, www.elections.on.ca, includes information of what ID is acceptable and how to update change of address and other information. How do I find out where my riding is? To find your electoral district, enter your postal code in the Elections Ontario Voter Information Service online tool. This handy tool will show you your electoral district name, electoral district number, who the current MPP is, plus maps and more general information. CAN YOU VOTE WITHOUT A VOTER INFORMATION CARD? Yes, providing you have proof of residence and have valid ID and show that information to election officials on voting day. Can you vote by mail? Yes, but in order to accomplish this, you must submit a vote-bymail application before Feb. 21 - available online - and provide ID with home address information. But no, you can't vote online. HOW SOON CAN SOMEONE VOTE IN ADVANCE? Residents are eligible to vote in advance at the local election office in their riding until 6 p.m. on Feb. 26. To do so, voters must present ID and fill out special ballot applications at local election offices. Voters can also go to the advance polling station in their riding between Feb. 20-22. Is it possible to vote at home? Yes, in rare circumstances involving medical necessities. Voters must contact local election offices to explain the circumstances.

Health-care staff retention alarms NDP; Province urged to recruit workers to west-central area after clinic closures,2025,"The Saskatchewan NDP is again taking aim at the provincial government's policies to recruit and retain health-care workers, with a particular eye to west-central Saskatchewan. Speaking Wednesday at the Legislative Building, health critic Vicki Mowat said health-care centre closures have been an ongoing issue over the past four years, highlighting closures in Wilkie as well as spotty ambulance services in Kerrobert. ""As resources are being pulled from Kindersley, Unity and even Alberta, wait times are rising, putting patient lives at risk,"" Mowat said. Information obtained via a freedom of information request by the NDP covering a four-year period regarding rural and remote closures shows 789 days collectively of disrupted services over that period. ""What we're seeing consistently is closures across the west-central area. We see a pattern of this government not providing recruiting and retention of health care workers,"" Mowat said. In an email response, the province said it was ""committed to strengthening and stabilizing health care services across the province, including in Lloydminster and the surrounding area."" The province again referenced the possibility of creating a nursing task force, which it sought to do on the eve of the provincial election, saying it has recently met with the unions representing nurses in Saskatchewan. The closures range from emergency rooms to laboratory services, radiography to obstetric services. Mowat said the closures are directly tied to staff shortages that she and the NDP say fall at the feet of the government. ""Simply put, though, the recruiting and retention strategy has failed, it is failing right now. We have health care workers leaving in droves. We have record numbers of folks that are leaving,"" Mowat said. The province has presented the Health Human Resource Action Plan as a means to address some of these issues, having first launched in 2022. Numbers provided in September 2024 by the Ministry of Health do not track how many doctors and nurses are leaving the profession, opting instead to tally the total numbers. From 2019 to 2023, family physicians in Saskatchewan increased from 1,340 to 1,466 and specialists increased from 1,260 to 1,441. In 2019, there were 11,685 RNs and 273 NPs, compared to 13,605 RNs and 360 NPs in 2023, according to the ministry. At the same time, the NDP cited a December 2024 report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) that indicated there were 526 fewer registered nurses in rural Saskatchewan from 2018 to 2023 and the second-worst patient-to-physician ratio at 221 physicians per 100,000 citizens. Rural and remote health critic Meara Conway called out three specific Saskatchewan Party MLAs from west-central constituencies: Kim Gartner, James Thorsteinson and Colleen Young. ""We haven't heard a peep from these MLAs. We know that the government touts a recruitment and retention plan that is not worth the paper that it's printed on,"" Conway said.

"NDP again pledges to defeat the government in March, as Liberals ask for lifeline to strike pharmacare deals:   Leader Jagmeet Singh walked back comments he made earlier this week",2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh again pledged to defeat the government by the end of March, as the minority Liberals tried to make the case for the New Democrats to give them a lifeline through to the fall to strike pharmacare deals and deal with the tariff threat. At a press conference in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. on Thursday, Mr. Singh walked back comments he made earlier this week when he opened the door to the NDP once again supporting the Liberals in the minority Parliament. ""We will be voting against the government at the end of March,"" Mr. Singh said repeatedly in response to several questions about his evolving position. ""We will be voting against the government at the end of March. Please ask me again, because I’ll repeat that again."" He argued that before then though, the New Democrats could work with the Liberals to create a tariff relief package. He did not explain, however, how legislation could be finalized before the U.S. clarifies what its tariffs against Canada will cover — or when the tariffs will be put in place. ""I’m demanding that the Liberal government call back Parliament. Let’s put before Parliament a package to protect workers, support workers that are impacted by these tariffs,"" Mr. Singh said. The government did not immediately provide a response to the NDP request to recall Parliament. The Conservatives have also requested a return of the House before prorogation ends on March 24. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has threatened to level 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian goods effective Feb. 1. But U.S. commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick suggested this week those tariffs could be avoided if the Trump administration is satisfied that Canada has tightened its border controls. However, Mr. Lutnick said another phase of tariffs could still come after April 1, once the administration has seen an internal report on the trade deficit between Canada and the U.S. Canadian officials have said they don’t know precisely what the White House is planning. In an interview prior to Mr. Singh’s press conference, Health Minister Mark Holland said that given the trade war, now is not a good time for an election. He also said the government needs more time to complete its negotiations for bilateral pharmacare agreements with provinces and territories. The country’s pharmacare law is the product of a now-defunct agreement that was in place between the Liberals and the New Democrats that saw the NDP prop up the minority government in exchange for policy concessions, such as pharmacare. Mr. Holland said Ottawa is now ""very close"" to striking the deals, but needs more time. ""If we have until October, then we can get every deal done,"" he said. ""To me, it makes no sense to, for the sake of a few months, throw away the opportunity to get these pharmacare deals done."" Last June, however, Mr. Holland said his objective was to see the drugs covered by April 1 of this year. He did not explain why a longer runway is now needed to implement the program. Bill C-64, the legislation allowing the government to strike the pharmacare deals, received royal assent on Oct. 10. A memorandum of understanding is already in place between the federal government and British Columbia. The MOU said that after Bill C-64 received royal assent, B.C. would enter formal discussions with the federal government to implement coverage for select contraception and diabetes medications. In a letter sent to Mr. Holland on Wednesday, Mr. Singh and NDP health critic Peter Julian called on the minister to finalize the pharmacare agreements to ensure access to contraceptives and diabetes medications, along with the expansion of a separate dental care program. ""Your government has all the legislation, and the funding needed to keep its promises on dental care and pharmacare now,"" the letter said. ""There will be no more time to get this done."" In a statement Thursday, Mr. Julian called Mr. Holland’s comments a ""Liberal ploy to buy time at the expense of Canadians."" ""They are willing to withhold birth control and insulin to buy more time for their new leader. It’s cynical,"" he said. Mr. Trudeau announced on Jan. 6 he would resign at the conclusion of a leadership race. The Liberals will elect a new leader on March 9 and the winner will also become prime minister. All the major opposition parties have pledged to defeat the Liberals when the House returns on March 24. Dr. Joss Reimer, the president of the Canadian Medical Association, said every physician knows of patients who cannot afford their medications, which means they may opt to take half doses or not take those medications at all. ""The sooner we can get these agreements signed, the better chance they have at surviving whatever the political winds may bring,"" she said. Conservatives did not support the Liberal government’s legislation on pharmacare that received royal assent in October. During a debate in the House of Commons last fall, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said he rejected a single-payer drug plan, calling it ""radical.""

Health workers' strike vote shows 'profound level of disappointment' with NDP,2025,"HEALTH support workers are upset they’ve had to vote overwhelmingly to go on strike under an NDP government, little more than a year and a half after doing so under the Tories. Allied health workers represented by the Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals have voted 96 per cent in favour of a strike mandate. They voted 99 per cent in favour of a strike mandate in 2023, after working five years without a contract. No strike date has been set. The union says retention, understaffing, increasing workloads and the lack of competitive wages are some of the main issues in both the current labour negotiations and the earlier ones. “I think that 96 per cent shows that profound level of disappointment,” said union president Jason Linklater on Wednesday. “I think what sticks out the most to me is it indicates a profound lack of trust. The health minister has publicly stated that retention is the most important step in fixing allied health. A vote like this indicates that there is not a belief that there’s an intention here.” Linklater said the negotiations which have led up to the strike vote are particularly upsetting because they were hoping the government of Wab Kinew would be different than the Brian Pallister and Heather Stefanson governments. “This is probably the most disappointing part for everyone,” he said. “This is the identical situation we were in with the previous government, in that Shared Health has a complete inability to fix anything if resources are not made available by government. “Manitobans deserve better, they were promised better, and I think our message here is that it is not too late to turn the bus around and start making right decisions and start caring for the people who care for Manitobans.” The union represents more than 7,000 workers in more than 50 professions including rural paramedics, respiratory therapists, mental health clinicians and lab and imaging technologists. It took 15 months of negotiations and a strike deadline before a six-year agreement was reached in 2023, after five years of working without a contract. That contract, settled just weeks before a provincial election, included a general wage increase of 8.35 per cent and other improvements. Kathleen Cook, the Progressive Conservative health critic, said the 96 per cent strike mandate “is a clear reflection of this government’s failure to deliver the relief and respect they promised to health-care workers. “The reality is simple: the NDP has no credible plan to fix the staffing crisis in health care. Front-line workers are burning out, and instead of real solutions, this government offers empty promises and delay tactics. “The NDP needs to stop making excuses and start fixing the crisis they claimed they could solve.” When asked about the strike vote, Kinew said he’s hoping for a deal. “We’ve been staffing up, I think everyone who has been working in health care sees that and that’s the first step to fixing health care,” he said. “Allied health workers are super valuable. I hope they notice that I try to say allied health all the time, when we’re talking about health care staffing, and that’s just one small example of the emphasis and the respect that we put in for the work that they do.” A Shared Health spokesman said it “is committed to the successful negotiation of a new and fair collective agreement for our province’s professional technical/paramedical sector employees.” The spokesman wouldn’t comment publicly about negotiations. “We remain at the bargaining table and continue to work towards a new collective agreement for all of these valued staff.” kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Kevin Rollason","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Rollason, Kevin",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 30, 2025",Workforce planning; Strikes; Contract negotiations,Nom: Shared Health; NAICS: 516210,2025-01-30,Winnipeg Free Press
Health advocate to run for NDP in Liberal stronghold,2025,"Health-care advocate Thomas Linner is seeking to become the first NDP MP in the St. Boniface-St. Vital seat, which is soon to be vacated by Liberal MP Dan Vandal. The 47-year-old Linner, who is married to NDP advanced education and training minister Renée Cable and is the father of two children, was acclaimed as the federal candidate at a recent meeting. Linner, who lives in Windsor Park, is currently the interim executive director of the Manitoba Federation of Labour’s Occupational Health Centre and the former director of the Manitoba Health Coalition. He sits on the board of directors of the Heartwood Healing Centre, a non-profit group that helps adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. “Public health care is critically important to me,” said Linner on Wednesday. “Canadians want to see public health care protected and they also want to see these services improved… a lot of the problems in health care came from cuts made by (Prime Minister) Stephen Harper and the Liberal government under Justin Trudeau has followed in this path.” In a statement, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he is proud that Linner, a longtime defender of the country’s universal health care system, is running as a candidate for his party. “He’s beaten Conservative plans to privatize health care for profit in Manitoba before, and he will bring that fight to Ottawa to ensure everyone can access health care when and where they need it with their health card, not their credit card,” said Singh. Vandal was elected to the House of Commons in late 2015. He announced in October that he would not seek re-election and was shuffled out of cabinet in December. Both the Liberals and Conservative parties have not announced candidates yet. Linner was born and raised in Saskatchewan and came here to work in the governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger. He has also worked for the leader of the NDP opposition in Saskatchewan. Linner said until now he never considered taking a shot at politics himself. He said he realizes he is in for a tough battle. In the last nine elections, the NDP has come in third in the riding, with the 1997 election being the lone time it came in second, squeaking just five votes ahead of the Reform Party candidate. The riding itself is, for the most part, a Liberal stronghold with the party losing to the Tories only five times in 29 previous elections. “It is going to be an uphill battle,” said Linner on Wednesday. “I know that and I am ready for the work. “But, if you look, all of the provincial ridings in St. Boniface and St. Vital are held by the NDP provincially. And the Probe polls in the last year show the NDP are leading the Liberals in Winnipeg.” kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Kevin Rollason","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Rollason, Kevin",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 30, 2025",Public health; Elections,,2025-01-30,Winnipeg Free Press

Tory MLA blames NDP for empty beds at Emerson care home,2025,"A staff shortage at a southern Manitoba care home has led to beds being empty even as people are in desperate need of a placement. Tory MLA Josh Guenter said the Emerson Health Centre, a care home in his Borderland constituency, has eight beds that can’t be filled owing to a lack of staff. “We’ve got families who are trying to get their loved ones into the Emerson personal care home. We’ve been advocating for them for quite some time now, and there’s just been no movement,” Guenter said Tuesday. The facility has openings for six care aides and five registered nurses, as per the job site for Southern Health, which oversees operation of the public care home. It has 20 beds, which means the home has a near-50 per cent vacancy rate. “You’ve got some of these individuals or people who have donated and contributed towards the care home over the years, and now they’re at the point where they’re ready to move in and they’re being told they can’t come in because of the vacancies,” Guenter said. Southern Health issued an email statement Tuesday that failed to answer questions about the staffing shortage in Emerson. In December, the Free Press investigated widespread staffing deficiencies that result in care home beds being unused. For example, two sections of Boyne Lodge Personal Care Home in Carman were closed due to the lack of staff, Southern Health told the Free Press at the time. It didn’t specify how many beds were empty. The Carman home has 105 beds — 79 in a new, main facility, and 26 in older and renovated units. Applicants waiting for a bed in Emerson are being staged in hospitals in Altona and Morris, forcing loved ones to make the lengthy drive to visit, Guenter said. “The NDP is allowing this issue to go on and is allowing this Emerson personal care home to die of neglect, which is absolutely wrong,” he said. Guenter accused the NDP of axing programs instituted by the former Progressive Conservative government to prop up staffing levels, including a recruitment drive in the Philippines. Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara shot back Tuesday, by saying the PC MLA was silent while his former colleagues cut care home staff and beds. “He sat in that caucus for years beside health ministers who cut health care in his own community, closed personal care home beds, fired nurses, froze the wages of health-care aids in rural Manitoba, and he’s never apologized for that. Now all he’s trying to do is deflect and still not take responsibility for the damage,” the health minister said. Rural and northern communities have higher vacancy rates due to the smaller pool of trained professionals, said Sue Vovchuk, the executive director of the Long Term and Continuing Care Association of Manitoba. The population is getting older and the government must continue to work with internationally educated nurses to fast-track their credentials as well as provide incentives to nurses to work in smaller communities, Vovchuk said, “We are trying to get a proactive look on that, a proactive approach, but it’s a slow burn,” she said. Statistics Canada has reported that in the third quarter of 2023, there were nearly 34,000 staffing vacancies in long-term care homes and residential care facilities across Canada. Manitoba issued a request for proposals for nursing agencies, which closed on Monday. The province will soon begin working with the private sector to regulate agency nurses while fulfilling the election promise to hire 1,000 health-care workers, Asagwara said. As of September, the NDP government hired 873 net new health workers, including many personal care home staff. The health minister did not have updated figures Tuesday but said the government would soon share news about recruitment and retention efforts. Southern Health’s recruitment work has included relocation and return of service incentives, paid education for uncertified workers and the offering of courses in the community, an unnamed spokesperson said Tuesday. The region is advertising on local and regional job sites, recruiting at career fairs, colleges, universities, and high schools and has had success through student placements from Indigenous Health Internship programs, the emailed statement said. nicole.buffie@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Nicole Buffie","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Buffie, Nicole",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 29, 2025",Workforce planning; Recruitment; Nurses; Labor shortages; Northern communities,,2025-01-29,Winnipeg Free Press
Singh may back Liberal tariff package:   But NDP leader planning to topple federal government as soon as possible,2025,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is not ruling out helping the Liberals pass a potential relief package for workers if Canada enters a trade war with the United States. But the New Democrat leader stressed there have been no discussions about such a package, and that his party still intends to try and topple the Liberals' minority government and trigger an election as soon as possible. ""I've maintained my position that I'll be voting against the government at the earliest opportunity,"" Singh said Tuesday. ""If the Liberals are serious though, about something, a plan that should be put in place to support workers, call the opposition leaders together. If they're serious about it, discuss that plan with us the way we did during the (COVID-19) pandemic. I've not seen any of that initiative."" A spokesperson from the Prime Minister's Office did not respond Tuesday when asked if the government planned to discuss any relief proposals with opposition parties. Having shut down Parliament when he announced his intention to resign once a new Liberal leader is chosen, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his minority government are grappling with U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on all Canadian goods. On Tuesday, a spokesperson from the White House reiterated that Trump intends to implement those 25 per cent tariffs on Saturday. In the meantime, the federal government has been preparing a potential response - including a possible relief package for workers and businesses affected by a trade war with the country's vital trading partner. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said last week that it's best not to compare any possible relief package to the massive government aid that flowed to individuals and businesses during the pandemic. But he did say the government would support workers, businesses, economic sectors and specific regions of the country in the event of a ""sustained"" response to American tariffs. LeBlanc added that he has had reassuring conversations about potential supports with provincial governments, including in Ontario, and that Ottawa is planning to use revenues collected from counter-tariffs on American imports to support sectors and workers impacted by a trade war. ""If we get into that scenario, people should be very reassured that in the case of Ontario, both (the federal and provincial) governments will very quickly work together to put in place the supports necessary,"" LeBlanc told the Star. Parliament is suspended until March 27, with the governing Liberals set to elect Trudeau's replacement as prime minister on March 9. But a senior government official told the Star on Tuesday that some supports for trade war relief would not require legislation to move forward, such as changes to more quickly provide employment insurance to workers who might lose their jobs. Speaking Tuesday from his home riding in Burnaby, B.C., Singh called on the Liberals to speak with opposition leaders about bringing forward a plan to support workers. He said there has been no outreach so far, and that any relief plan should target affected sectors and be tied to employment levels and keep wages and jobs in place. ""There needs to be strict rules in place that if any business is going to get support, that it has to be tied to workers,"" Singh said. On Parliament Hill, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet dismissed talk of a relief package as a gimmick to extend the life of the Liberal government. He said the Liberals should call an election sooner - perhaps after a new Liberal leader is chosen on March 9 - if they want to help people impacted by any tariff spat with the U.S. ""I believe that the intention would be to create a context in which the government would get one week - oh, two weeks - oh, three weeks - and then they remain there longer than supposed,"" Blanchet said. ""I'm not getting into any tricks."" The Conservatives, under Pierre Poilievre, have been demanding an election for months, and have tabled several failed confidence motions to try and defeat the Liberal government. Poilievre has also called on the Liberal government to reopen Parliament so the legislature can pass new border measures, discuss tariff retaliation, and prepare a plan to boost the economy. ""Had the Liberals not put their party ahead of their country, we could be debating and considering options to deal with this critical issue right now. Instead, they suspended Parliament to save their political skins, putting the livelihoods of Canadians at risk in face of this unjustified threat,"" said Conservative Deputy Leader Melissa Lantsman, in an emailed statement to the Star.

Hit man given life sentence for murder:   Ripudaman Singh Malik's family still wants to know who hired pair for 2022 Surrey shooting,2025,"One of the two hit men who shot Ripudaman Singh Malik to death in Surrey, B.C., in 2022 has been handed a life sentence without parole for 20 years - but the victim's family still wants to know who hired the pair of young killers. Tanner Fox, 24, told the B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster on Tuesday that he was sorry, and was ""young and dumb"" when he killed Malik, a former suspect in the 1985 Air India bombings. ""I know nothing I say will bring him back and I'm sorry for the role I played in this crime. Not a day goes by that I don't feel remorse for my actions,"" said Fox, dressed in an off-white suit, his hair slicked back. ""I've grown to see the error of my ways, and I'm sorry for all the hurt and pain I've caused."" The sentence is in line with a joint recommendation from defence and Crown lawyers. Malik was shot dead outside his business in July 2022, and while Fox and accomplice Jose Lopez pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last October, the identity of whoever ordered the hit has never been publicly revealed. Lopez is due back in court on Feb. 6. Malik was acquitted of charges related to the Air India bombings, which a Canadian government report says was the work of Sikh separatists, and his son said his father's legacy has been unfairly tarnished ever since. Jaspreet Singh Malik said outside the courthouse after the hearing that Fox's sentence gives a ""small sense of relief,"" but those who hired his father's killers remain at large. ""The only question that remains now is who hired Mr. Fox and Mr. Lopez,"" he said. ""I'm asking both Mr. Fox and Mr. Lopez to do the right thing. Tell the RCMP who hired you. Let those people be brought to justice."" Last October, RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the force had launched a special unit to investigate multiple cases of extortion, coercion and violence, including murders, linked to agents of the Indian government. Jaspreet Malik was surrounded by family and supporters outside court and he said his father's legacy shouldn't include Air India, but rather his commitment to his family, to education, as well as his work with the Sikh community. ""He was a devoted and loving grandfather. Being the founder of Khalsa Credit Union, being the founder of Khalsa School, and being a family man is what my father should be remembered for,"" he said. Fox and Lopez shot Malik seven times, including six times in the head and neck. Photographic exhibits show Malik's red Tesla with its windows shattered. The court heard victim impact statements from Malik's daughter, Kirat Kaur Malik, and daughter-in-law Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, who described him as a loving and dedicated father who valued education and family. Malik said her father loved his family ""unconditionally"" and was a ""pillar"" of the Sikh community, while Dhaliwal addressed Fox directly and urged him to reveal who hired him to ""erase"" Malik's legacy. ""Mr. Fox, our father was kind, and you took that kindness out of our life,"" she said. Justice Terence Schultes outlined Fox's criminal record including robbery, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, obstruction of a peace officer and probation-breach offences. ""Clearly he had fallen into some type of criminal lifestyle,"" Schultes said. ""There was nothing in his upbringing that would've predicted his involvement in such a serious offence as this one."" Fox's ineligibility for parole until July 2042 corresponds with a 20-year period from the date of his arrest.

Anthony Furey: Doug Ford readies to bulldoze NDP and Liberals,2025,"The Ontario provincial election that was triggered on Tuesday could unfold with a bang or with a whimper. Will the short campaign be full of unexpected twists and turns or will it be a sleepy affair where little changes? It's too soon to say which direction the early Feb. 27 vote that's been called by Premier Doug Ford will head in. The purpose of asking the electorate to go to the polls more than a year earlier than scheduled, according to Ford, is so he can get a clear mandate on how to respond to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on Canada and, therefore, on the Ontario economy. ""The kind of action required to respond to President Trump's threats will impact the province's fiscal plan and our path to balance,"" Ford explained in a guest op-ed in the Post. Ford says his Ontario PC government is planning to spend tens of billions of dollars in response to tariffs and to cut red tape and streamline approvals to spur economic activity. ""As taxpayers, this is your money. Ontario is your province and this is your future. Your voice should be heard,"" the premier added. That's the policy rationale. The political strategy though is believed to be that Ford wants to face his election before and not after a federal election - the idea being that if Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre becomes prime minister the voters may decide they have had their fill of conservatives and therefore be less inclined to re-elect Ford. If the election stays focused on the response to tariffs, then there should be no reason that Ford won't cruise to an easy re-election with the strong majority mandate he seeks. In this scenario, there is little room for NDP Leader Marit Stiles and Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie to make a meaningful mark or take the reins in the conversation. They have spent the months leading up to the election drawing attention to completely different domestic policy matters in the Ontario legislature. Ford will be looking beyond the Ontario legislature and speaking over the opposition leaders, as he discusses Trump's policies as well as the tariff responses from the federal government and other Canadian premiers. There will be little need for him to even mention his opponents, which will be maddening for them as it will turn them into supporting characters in a show where they were expecting to be featured centre stage. Besides, Ford has spent the bulk of his time as premier focused on economic growth and competitiveness. Responding to tariffs fits in just fine with his skillset to date. The same can't be said for the opposition parties. Giving the keys to the province to the NDP when the economy is in a precarious position is the last thing you'd want to do. If this is how the election plays out, expect an uneventful campaign where the opposition fails to gain traction and the results closely match those of the 2022 provincial vote. These are all big ""ifs"" on hand though. Donald Trump could turn on a dime. Tariffs could be punitive and enacted swiftly. Or they could be dropped in an instant and the conversation abruptly ends. The American president could propose something entirely new and unexpected that sends Canadian politicians' best laid plans out the window. A campaign strategy that relies heavily on deftly navigating the whims and fancies of Donald Trump is risky business. This year has already proven to be a wild ride politically. Twelve months ago it was difficult to imagine Justin Trudeau announcing his resignation and Canadians earnestly discussing whether or not they wish to become the 51st state and yet here we are - and it's only January. Whatever the focus of the Ontario election on day one, it's unlikely that it will hold until the end of the campaign, if only because of the current pace of the news cycle. Unexpected events could derail Ford's campaign strategy. That said, the basic math within the legislature's seating chart will be hard for the opposition to overcome. The Progressive Conservatives hold a commanding majority with 79 seats, compared to 28 for the NDP and 9 for the Liberals. Even if the issues up for debate change, don't expect a big swing in the seat count. anthony@furey.ca( mailto:anthony@furey.ca ) Randall Denley: Just attacking Doug Ford won't bring the victory Ontario Liberals think it will Doug Ford: A strong mandate needed to protect Ontario",National Post (Online); Toronto,Toronto,Carson Jerema,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 28, 2025",Provincial elections; Political campaigns; Election results; Legislatures; Tariffs,,2025-01-28,National Post
Young hitman who killed Surrey businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik sentenced to life,2025,"The young hitman who killed Surrey businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in 2022 apologized to his family Tuesday before being sentenced to life without any chance of parole for 20 years. While Tanner Fox, now 24, expressed remorse for his role in the targeted execution of the 75-year-old, he would not tell the court who hired him, despite a plea from Malik's daughter-in-law. B.C. Supreme Court Justice Terence Schultes accepted a joint sentencing submission for the 20-year minimum term made by prosecutor Matthew Stacey and defence lawyer Richard Fowler. ""The degree of moral blameworthiness demonstrated by the extensive steps to prepare for - and then escape - what was in fact, an execution of Mr. Malik, as well as the disturbing nature of that execution itself amply support the period of parole ineligibility that has been recommended,"" he said. Earlier Tuesday, Sundeep Kaur Dhaliwal, who is married to Malik's eldest son Jaspreet, begged Fox to name those who hired him and co-accused Jose Lopez to ""assassinate"" Malik outside his business at 8236 128th St. just before 9:30 a.m. on July 14, 2022. ""We plead with you to reveal the names of the people who hired you. This is the right thing to do,"" she said in her statement to the judge, while also lamenting the loss of her beloved ""Daddy Ji."" Ripudaman Singh Malik in court in 2003. Sketch by Felicity Don She turned several times to the prisoner's box to speak directly to the killer, who was dressed in a light-coloured suit with his hair slicked back. ""Mr. Fox, you allowed someone to hire you to take away this positive powerhouse from our lives."" She also said the Malik family struggles with fear. ""We have been anxious and sometimes even scared. This fear and anxiety comes from not knowing who hired you,"" she said. Fox asked to address the court later in the morning, but did not answer Dhaliwal's question. Jaspreet Malik, son of slain Surrey businessman Ripuadaman Singh Malik, speaks to the media following the sentencing hearing for his father's killer, Tanner Fox, at New Westminster Courthouse Tuesday, January 28, 2025. ""I know nothing I say will bring him back. I'm sorry for the role I played in this crime,"" Fox said, reading from a piece of paper. ""Not a day goes by that I don't feel remorse for my actions. Three years ago, I was young, and I've grown to see the error of my ways."" The courtroom was packed with relatives and supporters of Malik, a controversial figure who was acquitted 20 years ago in the 1985 Air India bombing case. He was one of the founders of Khalsa School and Khalsa Credit Union, just some of the charitable work he did for the community, Dhaliwal noted. Fowler told Schultes his client was adopted from Thailand by an Abbotsford couple and was a good student before slipping into a life of crime. He said Fox's decision to plead guilty to second-degree murder in October was a sign of the strength of the prosecution case, but also a sign that his client wanted to take responsibility. Fox was originally charged with first-degree murder. Schultes summed up details from the agreed statement of facts entered at the October hearing and cited again by Stacey Tuesday. Schultes said Fox and Lopez, who also pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing, ""were hired and paid to commit the murder using a stolen vehicle that had had its licence plates changed."" ""He drove to Mr. Malik's business on 128th Street in Surrey on the morning of the offence and waited for him to arrive for work,"" Schultes said. ""When he did so, they approached his vehicle and fired a total of seven shots at him at close range, causing his death. There were employees of Mr. Malik's business and of other businesses in the same complex outside at the time, and they fled in response to the shooting."" Various police agencies investigate the shooting death of Ripudaman Singh Malik at 8236 128th Street in Surrey in 2022. The two men escaped in a Honda CRV they had been driving, then burned the vehicle in a nearby laneway and drove off in an Infiniti they had left parked in the area. Police later searched residences linked to the two men and recovered a Puma backpack that contained masks and gloves with the DNA of both men on them, the two firearms used in the murder, plus ammunition magazines. At Lopez's New Westminster apartment, police found $16,485 in cash and his cellphone on which there was ""a video from July 16, 2022, that depicted a hand fanning out $100 bills onto a carpet,"" Stacey said. Fox's cellphone, seized at his Abbotsford home, also had a photograph taken the same day ""of a large amount of $100 bills."" Schultes also said the victim impact statements read by Dhaliwal and Malik's daughter Kirat showed how much those close to Malik continue to suffer. ""They each movingly described Mr. Malik's integral role in their family unit, his significant contributions to his greater community, and the irreplaceable loss that his murder has caused in their family,"" Schultes said. ""It is still clear that the impact of this offence on those left behind has been very severe."" Lopez had been scheduled to be sentenced Friday, but the date has been postponed. The absence of information about who hired the hitmen reflects a trend in B.C. where shooters in contract killings have been pleading guilty to lesser charges without providing any details about who hired them. Malik, a one-time supporter of the separatist Khalistan movement, was acquitted of murder in the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people, as well as a second bombing that left two Japanese baggage handlers dead.

NDP urges Moe to recall legislature; Leader Beck says MLAs need to discuss response to any tariffs imposed by Trump,2025,"With U.S. President Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs still looming, Saskatchewan's Opposition says an emergency legislative session may be necessary as the Feb. 1 target approaches. Speaking Monday at the Legislative Building, NDP Leader Carla Beck stressed that if the ""extraordinary threat"" of tariffs comes into force, then the Saskatchewan legislature should be recalled for an emergency session to address the challenge. Beck sent a letter directly to Premier Scott Moe on Monday outlining the proposal. The Government of Saskatchewan did not respond to a request for comment by press deadline. Trump has threatened Canada and Mexico with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. His rationale ranges from concerns over border security to a perceived trade deficit between the countries. ""We're thinking in terms of 25 per cent on Mexico and Canada because they're allowing vast numbers of people - Canada's a very bad abuser also - vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in,"" Trump said on Jan. 20. Moe has pushed for ""de-escalation"" between the countries as Canada's federal government presents a ""nothing off the table"" approach to trade talks. In terms of responding to the proposed tariffs, Moe has not gone as far as some premiers who've threatened to take American liquor off store shelves or discouraged citizens from spending tourists dollars in the U.S. Instead, the Saskatchewan premier has said he favours limited and specifically targeted tariffs against the United States, with an aim to remove the new taxes as soon as possible if they come into force. Two days notice would be required to recall MLAs to the legislature. Based on Trump's stated target of Feb. 1 to impose tariffs, that means Monday, Feb. 3, would be the date tentatively set by the NDP. However, it's ultimately up to the Speaker to decide when MLAs return to session. At this point, Beck said there are no concrete answers for the broad yet consistent threat of tariffs that loom over Saskatchewan. She suggested an eye toward aid packages for particularly affected industries but, without specifics regarding the tariffs, Beck said she was not able to discuss details about possible aid. ""This is going to threaten the livelihoods of entire industries, generational farms. This would be devastating,"" said Beck. ""People in this province expect us to be ready."" Beck also took a shot at the last time an emergency session was called - for a debate in 2023 on the Parents'Bill of Rights (Bill 137). ""This meets the true measure of an emergency session,"" she said of the tariff threat, noting that it could mean billions in lost revenue for Saskatchewan.

"Fifteen months in, no sign NDP improving health care",2025,"Manitoba’s NDP government could be forgiven if it still hasn’t “fixed” health care — as it promised to do during the 2023 election — after only 15 months in office. After all, it takes time to bring down wait lists and improve the quality of health care — it can’t be done overnight. Still, after 15 months, the public is looking for signs of any kind that improvements are on the way. So far, there appear to be few, if any. Even the people who work on the front lines of health care are not seeing improvements. In fact, some of them say the system has worsened. “There’s a true disconnect between what government is saying in news conferences and campaigns, and what people in health care on the front lines see every single day,” said Jason Linklater, president of the Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals, whose organization recently commissioned a survey of its members. The verdict: close to half (48 per cent) said their workplace lost staff last year and 62 per cent said their workload got worse in 2024. That’s bad news for a health-care system that’s been struggling with acute shortages of front-line workers in recent years. There’s more: 59 per cent of respondents in the survey felt morale has worsened in their workplace. It’s not exactly what you’d expect to hear 15 months into the first term of a government that pledged to “listen to front-line workers,” improve morale on the front lines and hire more staff. “When we hear messaging coming from government that doesn’t reflect reality, it leads me to believe we’re at a stalemate in terms of being able to actually fix the system,” said Linklater, whose organization represents allied health workers, including paramedics, respiratory therapists, lab and imaging technologists and mental health clinicians. Government claims to have hired 870 net new health care workers, although that’s difficult to independently verify. Of those, only 10 per cent were allied workers. The association wasn’t the only organization that surveyed its members to gauge progress in health care. The Manitoba Nurses Union released a survey this week that showed 42 per cent of its members gave the province a “D” (no improvement) in health-care delivery. Another 24 per cent said there is “very minimal improvement” and 23 per cent said things have become worse. That means nearly two-thirds of respondents in the nurses union survey said there’s been either no improvement in health care or things have gotten worse. That’s not a great sign. It doesn’t give the public confidence that the province is doing the things necessary to alleviate hospital overcrowding, reduce emergency room wait times and speed up access to surgical procedures and diagnostic testing. If those things were happening, health-care professionals working on the front lines would notice them. It wouldn’t necessarily lead to immediate reductions in wait times, but the preliminary work — including hiring more staff — would be obvious to those who work directly with patients. They’re not noticing it. In fact, many say the system is worse today than it was 15 months ago. It doesn’t help that allied workers have been without a contract since March 31, 2024. The NDP, while in opposition, criticized the former Progressive Conservative government for failing to bargain with health-care workers in a timely manner. Now they’re doing the same thing. It’s hurting morale, something the NDP during the provincial election vowed to change. It also doesn’t help that the NDP has given away hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts, which has contributed to a projected deficit of $1.3 billion in 2024-25. As a result, it has less money to invest in health care and other front-line services. Meanwhile, ER and urgent care wait times were slightly higher in November 2024 at Winnipeg hospitals (the most recent data available) at 3.65 hours (median wait time) compared with 3.57 hours in November 2023, a few weeks after NDP Premier Wab Kinew was sworn into office. Wait times for hip and knee replacement surgery were slightly higher in 2024 than in 2023, as were wait times for MRIs, CT scans and ultrasounds. If things were getting better in health care, even marginally, it would be reflected in surveys conducted by organizations such as the association of health care professionals and the nurses union. It would also start to show up in the data for wait times. So far, a year and three months into the NDP’s first term, there’s no sign of that at all. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 25, 2025",Health care; Nurses; Medical personnel,,2025-01-25,Winnipeg Free Press
Lorne Gunter: Jagmeet Singh and NDP out of touch on Donald Trump deportees,2025,"New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh wants Canada to renege on a treaty it has with the United States that says people illegally in one of the two countries cannot apply for refugee status in the other. For nearly six years, from 2017 to 2023, the Liberal government itself ignored the 2004 Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA). Tens of thousands of so-called ""Irregular"" border crossers from the United States were welcomed to Canada, the vast majority of them through the infamous Roxham Road crossing between Upstate New York and Quebec. Now Jagmeet Singh wants to open the floodgates again, this time to welcome illegal aliens in the U.S. who are trying to avoid deportation as part of the immigration crackdown ordered by newly installed President Donald Trump. As of Friday, American immigration officials had deported or detained over 1,500 people who were in the U.S. illegally. The vast majority of those rounded up had criminal records. And the vast majority of those had histories of violent crime. Yet Singh wants Canada to abrogate the STCA and make itself a haven for more illegal immigrants. When Singh said this week that it was ""sad"" and ""scary"" what was going on in the States, I'm confident he wasn't making a case specifically to turn Canada into a refuge for murderers, rapists, bank robbers and wifebeaters. However, our border protections are already so weak that they are at the core of Trump's tariff threats against Canadian industries. If we were to follow Singh's recommendation and open our borders to American deportees, there can be little doubt that criminals would embed themselves among the other deportees. ""I think it's really sad for the folks in the States right now,"" Singh lamented. ""It's really scary for a lot of folks. I just want to acknowledge how scary that must be for people who ... now feel really alone, who feel really afraid."" ""I think what Canada has always done is shown as a country that we are there for people when they are in a time of need. It's something that has been a point of pride for Canada."" Yep, sappy sentimentality, that's the emotion we want driving our immigration policy. Not only do we have a problem of our own with millions too many immigrants, but the future prosperity of our economy is dependent on how we handle our borders with the Americans. Want 25% tariffs imposed on everything entering the States from Canada as soon as possible? Want the economic repercussions that would go along with the Americans imposing such punitive measures? Well then, Mr. Singh, please continue trying to make Canada's border even more of an immigration concern for the Americans. Another consideration is that we already have a problem of our own with super-high immigration. The Americans estimate they have 11 million illegal immigrants on their shores. Canada has nearly five million foreign students, visitors, tourists and temporary workers whose visas will expire this year, and no way for our government to force those with expired visas to leave. And remember, we have a population only one-ninth the size of theirs. If you want to know why the NDP has failed to make headway politically, even as the Liberals have stumbled, here's a prime example of how completely out-of-touch they have become with where ordinary Canadians are mentally. It's true the Liberals have scaled back immigration somewhat, but nowhere near enough. From July through September, the Trudeau government admitted ""only"" 177,000 people, which, according to Statistics Canada was ""the slowest quarterly growth since the first quarter of 2022."" That still means nearly three-quarters of a million immigrants will enter Canada this year. We have capacity in our housing market, our labour force and health care system for about 300,000. Now on top of that number, Singh wants to add tens of thousands more illegals from the States.

"Nenshi acclaimed as candidate in Notley's riding; Edmonton-Strathcona 'the beating heart'of the provincial party, NDP leader says",2025,"Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi has been acclaimed as the party's candidate in Edmonton-Strathcona. Nenshi didn't face any competition for the nomination and, if elected, would become the third NDP leader to represent the riding. It's the latest hurdle for the former Calgary mayor to get a seat in the legislature after he took the helm of the Opposition party in June. Former NDP leader Rachel Notley stepped down as the member for Edmonton-Strathcona Dec. 30, which forces the government to call a byelection by the end of June. The governing United Conservative Party has yet to open a nomination contest in the riding. Notley won almost 80 per cent of votes in Edmonton-Strathcona in the 2023 general election, but her NDP was defeated by Premier Danielle Smith's United Conservatives. Nenshi, in a statement Wednesday night marking the milestone, expressed gratitude for Notley serving for 16 years as the MLA for an area home to what he called the party's most dedicated activists and longtime members. ""Edmonton-Strathcona is known across this province as the beating heart of our party,"" he said. Nenshi also took a swipe at Smith, calling her self-interested. ""Albertans deserve better,"" he said. ""They deserve a government that is focused on supporting strong public education, worldclass public health care and a vibrant and diverse economy."" UCP spokesperson Dave Prisco said in a statement to The Canadian Press the party is having a nomination contest ""so that Edmontonians get to actually choose their candidate and not have someone parachuted in."" ""Our candidate will actually be from Edmonton and care about the issues of Edmontonians,"" Prisco said. Smith, when her office was asked if a byelection might be called in time to see Nenshi participate in the legislature's spring sitting, responded in part by pointing to the June 30 deadline under Alberta election laws. ""I have spoken with our UCP party president and executive director and asked them to initiate the nomination process to choose a locally selected UCP candidate using our party's grassroots process,"" she said. ""It's important that all Albertans are being served and represented by their local MLA."" The legislature is scheduled to convene in late February for the 2025 budget and break for the summer in late May.

Schmidt named education minister:   NDP shuffles cabinet after death of Altomare,2025,"The Kinew government has undergone a cabinet shuffle following the death of education minister Nello Altomare. Altomare, two-term NDP MLA for Transcona, died on Jan. 14 while he was on medical leave. The 61-year-old educator, better known as “the mayor of Transcona” among his political colleagues, had been living with complications from chemotherapy. On Thursday, one day after <a href=""https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2025/01/22/education-minister-remembered-as-husband-dad-and-huge-jets-fan"" target=""_blank"" title=""Education minister remembered as husband, dad"">a public funeral</a>, the province announced a series of operational changes that were formalized shortly after his death. Tracy Schmidt, MLA for Rossmere, has moved ministerial files, to education from environment. Riel MLA Mike Moyes — who was the NDP caucus chair, as well as a legislative assistant for both environment and education — will be responsible for Schmidt’s old portfolio. St. Boniface MLA Robert Loiselle has been named the new caucus chair, while Tuxedo MLA Carla Compton is now deputy chair. Schmidt became acting minister of education when Altomare went on medical leave in October, in addition to overseeing the cabinet role she has held since the NDP was sworn in one year earlier. While she is not an educator by trade, Schmidt is the daughter of two teachers whose careers in the Winnipeg School Division span upwards of 80 years, combined. In an interview, she said public education was the typical dinner-table topic in her home as a child. “I grew up hearing about the needs of students on a daily basis,” she said, adding her parents, much like her predecessor, sought to help hungry students and those without proper winter gear whenever they could. “There was times in the winter where I’d go to get dressed in the morning and my mitts might be missing or my boots might be missing and my mum would say, ‘Don’t worry about it; we’ll go shopping after school.’” The mother of three sends all of her children, who range in age from nine to 14, to classes in the River East Transcona School Division. Schmidt hinted she’s hopeful Premier Wab Kinew will issue her a revised mandate letter given Altomare accomplished an “exceptional” amount during his first year on the job. The NDP rolled out a universal school nutrition program at the start of the school year. “I’m just really excited to pick up that torch and do my best in working for students and families and educators across the province in his honour,” Schmidt said. Prior to entering politics in 2023, she worked as a lawyer specializing in labour and employment law. Schmidt noted many people, both within government and outside of it, are mourning the loss of the former education minister, and she is keeping the Altomare family in her thoughts as she accepts this “honour of a lifetime” role. She added that she has “absolutely enormous” shoes to fill. Moyes, who is also a parent of school-aged children, is among a number of certified teachers in the NDP caucus. The new minister of environment and climate change taught English and history at Glenlawn Collegiate prior to his 2023 victory over Rochelle Squires, who was PC families minister at the time. Both ministers were sworn in at a private ceremony. maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 24, 2025",Students; Climate change; Teachers; Education,,2025-01-24,Winnipeg Free Press
"Health staff have bone to pick with government:   Surveys show morale, workload worse or unchanged since NDP elected",2025,"Two new surveys of allied health-care staff and nurses suggest workloads and morale are worse or unchanged for many since the NDP government vowed to make life better for them when it was elected 15 months ago. Jason Linklater, president of the Manitoba Association of Health Care Professionals, whose members are without a contract, said the results of a poll by that union should set alarm bells ringing. “There’s a true disconnect between what government is saying in news conferences and campaigns, and what people in health care on the front lines see every single day,” he said. “When we hear messaging coming from government that doesn’t reflect reality, it leads me to believe we’re at a stalemate in terms of being able to actually fix the system.” The association represents allied health workers, including paramedics, respiratory therapists, lab and imaging technologists and mental health clinicians. The union emailed a three-question survey to 6,012 members in December to find out how they felt about staffing, workload and morale in 2024, following a longer survey in May. The latest questionnaire was completed by 1,446 members. Almost half (48 per cent) said their workplace lost staff last year, while 41 per cent said staffing levels were about the same, and 11 per cent said there had been improvement. A majority (62 per cent) said their workload got worse in 2024, while 36 per cent said they were doing about the same amount of work, and two per cent said their workload had decreased. The association said 59 per cent of respondents felt morale had worsened in their workplace, 33 per cent noticed no change and eight per cent reported an improvement. An employee who works in mental-health and addictions services said it’s difficult to stay hopeful or positive, given the state of the system. “I love my job, but sometimes I ask: can I continue to do this?” said the person, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. The employee said current workloads are unsustainable and more staff are needed to better support patients. While their hope for change has faded, the employee said it’s still early for the NDP. “There was a lot of hope (after the October 2023 election) because their whole basis was fixing health care. It’s tough to continue to find that hope when nothing has really changed,” they said. The NDP promised to listen to workers and “rebuild” trust after seven years of Progressive Conservative government. “We hear you,” Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara said in response to the association survey. “I respect what allied health-care professionals tell us their experiences are, and I take them very seriously.” Under the NDP, Manitoba has hired more than 870 net new health-care workers, and it has seen improvements in vacancy rates, Asagwara said. About 10 per cent of the net new hires were allied health positions as of late September. Their contract expired March 31, 2024, making them the only public health-care sector without a new collective agreement, the union said. Previously, the workers went five years without a contract. Linklater called on the government to create a strategy that assesses current allied health staffing levels and determines how to retain, recruit and train the number of staff who will be needed in future. Asagwara said the government is happy to work with “experts and partners” to boost capacity. On Monday, the Manitoba Nurses’ Union released the results of its own member survey, which was completed by 1,326 members in October. They were asked to grade the government’s performance on fulfilling election promises to improve health care and patient outcomes in the first year of its four-year term. The nurses union said 42 per cent gave the province a “D” (no improvement), and 24 per cent gave a “C” (very minimal improvement). A similar number (23 per cent) gave the government an “F” (things have become worse), while 10 per cent gave a “B” (some improvement) and one per cent offered an “A” (lots of improvement). The union said 65 per cent felt the government was not effective at addressing issues or potential solutions suggested by nurses during Asagwara and Premier Wab Kinew “listening tours” of hospitals and other health-care sites. Last June, a Doctors Manitoba report found 46 per cent of physicians were considering leaving the province, retiring or reducing their clinical work hours in the next three years. About three-quarters said they were considering leaving or retiring due to frustration, burnout, heavy workloads or excessive paperwork, said Doctors Manitoba, which represents more than 4,000 physicians and medical learners. chris.kitching@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Chris Kitching","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Kitching, Chris",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 24, 2025",Workforce planning; Workloads; Health care; Nurses,,2025-01-24,Winnipeg Free Press

"B.C. scores another victory in long legal battle against opioid companies with class-action certification:   The lawsuit, first launched by B.C.’s NDP government almost six years ago, is a milestone in the effort to recover health care costs over alleged wrongful corporate conduct",2025,"A British Columbia Supreme Court judge has certified a class-action lawsuit against opioid companies led by the provincial government, a milestone in the effort to recover health care costs over alleged wrongful corporate conduct. The B.C. NDP government first launched the lawsuit almost six years ago. The claims that have not yet been tested in court, and extended litigation is likely ahead. Justice Michael Brundrett of the B.C. Supreme Court, in his 226-page judgment, acknowledged the complications as the case proceeds, but concluded a class action should be certified, in part because it would be a fair, efficient and manageable way to address the allegations. He further concluded that a class action was a “far better option than the alternatives,” such as individual cases. “I find the defendants’ concerns about potentially complex individual issues to be overstated,” Justice Brundrett wrote in his conclusion on certification. “The substantial ingredients of the liability issues are central here and can be resolved in a common way.” The court hearings to certify the class action against opioids companies took place over 17 days in late 2023. The B.C. government, as the lead plaintiff, alleges that “wrongful conduct in over-promoting prescription opioid use” led to substantial public health care costs to deal with the severe impact of the overdose crisis. B.C. is joined in the class action by all federal, provincial and territorial governments. More than 40 companies that make, distribute and sell legal opioids are named as defendants. They fought against a class action, in part arguing that there were differences between the dozens of companies named in the lawsuit. Similar legal action against tobacco companies is set to conclude this month, marking a $32.5-billion win in favour of governments across Canada and people harmed by smoking, though it took more than a quarter-century to resolve. Drug overdoses have hit B.C. the hardest of all provinces. In 2016, B.C. declared a public-health emergency. Across Canada, opioids killed almost 50,000 people, from the start of 2016 through mid-2024. Most of the deaths were in B.C., Ontario and Alberta. Nav Persaud, a family doctor in Toronto and Canada Research Chair in Health Justice, said that while more action is needed to turn the tide on the country’s drug crisis, the certification is an encouraging development. “Those who profit from the opioid crisis have escaped accountability in Canada while criminal convictions were rendered in the U.S.,” he said. “This is a step in the right direction, toward justice.” One of the main allegations in the class action is that companies marketed the legal drugs as less addictive and less likely to be misused. “We intend to prove that the opioid crisis was caused by the wrongful conduct of these defendants and hold them accountable for putting profits before people,” said Reidar Mogerman, a lawyer at CFM Lawyers LLP in Vancouver and counsel for B.C. in the class action. The Globe and Mail reached out to numerous companies named as defendants but did not get a response from many of them Wednesday. One of the companies, Metro Inc.’s Jean Coutu Group, said in a statement that “we are challenging the court’s jurisdiction and believe these proceedings to be without merits.” Opioids maker Purdue Pharma (Canada) has already settled. In 2022, it agreed to a $150-million deal with federal, provincial and territorial governments in the context of the proposed class action. The certification is B.C.’s second big court victory on opioids in two months. In late November, the province won a related case at the Supreme Court of Canada against several opioids companies. At dispute was a provision in B.C.’s 2018 Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act that enabled the government to include other provinces, territories and Ottawa in a collective class action on the issue. This was new legal territory. The Supreme Court ruled it made sense for governments to proceed as a group: “National class actions, and in particular multi‑Crown class actions, ensure that justice is not blocked by provincial borders. The opioid epidemic is a stark example of a crisis that should attract co-operation.” If B.C. had lost at the top court, each government would have had to pursue legal action on their own. Instead, other governments can now choose to officially opt-in to the certified class action over a period of 30 days. Ottawa plans to opt-in, said Ya’ara Saks, federal Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, in a post on X: “Our work to end the predatory practices of the pharmaceutical industry continues.” Niki Sharma, B.C. Attorney-General, in a statement Wednesday cited the likely pan-Canadian nature of this class action: “We will keep on fighting for people in our province and all of Canada, because it is the right thing to do.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Ebner, David; Woo, Andrea",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 22, 2025",Drug overdose; Health care expenditures; Class action lawsuits; Government; Narcotics; Certification,,2025-01-22,The Globe and Mail
Mulcair: Trump wants our w ater,2025,"I remember, as a young lawyer, consulting the massive volumes of tariffs and duties that Canada charged on incoming products. At the time, you had to wade through hundreds of pages to find the exact category of the product involved. You then had to advise your client as to what had to be added to the price of the product when it was imported into Canada. Applying and enforcing those endlessly detailed tariffs also required a massive government bureaucracy. Thanks to freer trade around the world over the last 50 years, many of those tariffs and duties have been eliminated. One of the most complete recent free trade agreements is the one with Canada and Mexico that Donald Trump negotiated the last time he was U.S. president. Apparently he's forgotten. On inauguration day, Trump was once again bellowing that he'll attack his closest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Never mind that under our free trade agreement, that would be patently illegal. Never mind that Trump, who promised to reduce red tape, is now boasting he'll create a mammoth new bureaucracy, the External Revenue Service, to collect all of the cash that he says will flow into U.S. government coffers. Never mind that tariffs are just a tax on everything that will have to be paid by American consumers. Those are all just facts, and as we've learned over the years, Trump lives in a fact-free world. Trump knows he has to come up with some sort of justification, so he just invents one. In this case it's fentanyl and illegal entries into the United States. He summed it up by saying that ""Canada is a very bad abuser,"" a pathetic lie - but we've all grown so used to Trump that we barely react. What Canada has done is prepare intelligently. We have an outstanding U.S. ambassador, Kirsten Hillman, who has been doing extraordinary work coaching Canada's cabinet and reaching out to American decision makers. Canada has prepared a threefold plan. First, continue to work to prevent the tariffs, which haven't been applied yet (they're still in Trump's mind). Second, prepare a proportionate retaliatory response, knowing that Canadian consumers are the ones who would pay our own tariffs. Third, work on a long-term approach. Because of freer trade, Canada seems to have taken its eye off the ball of foreign ownership of our national resources. In the 1970s, the concern was the Americanization of Canada and the battle for the control of our economy. The players have changed. Great investigative journalism today has shown how foreign companies now control swaths of Canada's forests that are four times the size of Nova Scotia, while Ottawa says it can't do anything about it. While control over resources, such as the rare earths to be found in Greenland, is now on Trump's agenda, he's got his eye on another Canadian resource: water. Trump's classic negotiating technique is to make a ridiculous proposition and then get a relieved opponent to agree to something less absurd he puts on the table. Saying Canada should be the 51st state by attacking our economy is just such a ploy. During his recent election campaign, Trump spoke about diverting Canadian water to the southern states. Never mind the scientific consensus that global warming and climate change are a cause of the enduring droughts in the U.S. Trump has decided to extract and burn more fossil fuels even as he withdraws the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and denies the existence of climate change. Trump seems to have found his own solution to those droughts and it doesn't involve decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Canada's water resources are his real target.

"Data should inform bike lane debate Who actually uses Toronto ...[Derived Headline ] :   Who actually uses Toronto's bike lanes - and who really benefits from them? Cohn, Jan. 14 'No ice is safe ice': Police, safety advocates offer advice after a fatal Toronto Islands skating accident Jagmeet Singh calls for aggressive response to Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, Jan. 13",2025,"Data should inform bike-lane debate Who actually uses Toronto's bike lanes - and who really benefits from them? Cohn, Jan. 14 In his column about winter cycling in Toronto, Martin Regg Cohn assures us that he will support his article with ""facts and stats."" Then he uses a single figure for citywide bicycle commuting that neither segregates out winter cycling nor distinguishes between roads with and without bike lanes. How many people risk cycling on arterials such as Bathurst Street, Lawrence Avenue or Islington Avenue in the absence of bike lanes? He also tells us - without data - that it's mostly food couriers using bike lanes in the winter, as if this were a compelling argument against them. If bike lanes didn't exist, we'd still have bike couriers, but they would be deprived of their safety. As to why many couriers are on heavy e-bikes, ask Premier Doug Ford: he's the one who's dropped the ball on proper regulation. And if Cohn is truly concerned about the exploitation of food couriers, he should push the Ford government to deem these vulnerable workers employees instead of independent contractors without rights. Cycling is less popular in Toronto during the winter than in other seasons, though there's still substantial participation where good infrastructure exists. As I write this letter, the temperature outside is -7 C, yet the Bloor Street bike lane is well-used by commuters. Perhaps if Cohn is concerned about funding for city programs, he might ask how many millions of dollars are spent and thousands of tonnes of toxic salt spread on city roads each year to clear the way for motorists in single-occupant cars. This would be more productive than challenging small investments in bike lanes that allow thousands of Torontonians to get around our city in an affordable, safe and healthy way - and many others to remain in the warmth of their homes waiting for a courier to deliver hot food. Albert Koehl, Toronto Advice for when you're on the ice 'No ice is safe ice': Police, safety advocates offer advice after a fatal Toronto Islands skating accident I was profoundly saddened to read about the tragic drowning of the man who fell through the ice while skating on Lake Ontario near the Toronto Islands. Every year, when the weather turns cold enough, many residents of this city seem to develop wild-ice fever. Authorities have made efforts to stop Torontonians from skating on patches of ice in High Park, in the Rouge River Estuary and near the Islands, but perhaps it's in our DNA to seek out the joyful and liberating experience of gliding along the city's frozen waterways. It's a part of our culture, and it's delightful. The article does well to say that ""no ice is safe ice"" while still providing safety tips to those readers who nevertheless can't get enough of it. Yet one critical piece of safety gear was not mentioned: ice picks worn around the shoulders, which make it much easier to slide back onto an ice shelf if one has fallen through. I don't venture out onto the ice without them, regardless of how cold it has been and for how long. Mark Schemeit, Toronto Would Singh invest in our military? Jagmeet Singh calls for aggressive response to Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, Jan. 13 I'm so pleased to hear that NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is calling for an ""aggressive response"" to U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's tariff threats. Should I therefore take it that he supports meeting Canada's NATO commitments by investing in our military? Bob Ciupa, Niagara Falls, Ont. The view from south of the border As an American, I am disturbed and embarrassed to see our president-elect make insulting comments about Canada, our much-loved neighbour. I do hope that Canadians won't come to think he represents the sentiment of all or even most Americans. We love Canada and Canadians, and no one I know subscribes to this ridiculous idea. It is beyond belief to think that Canadians would want their sovereign nation to become a U.S. state. Canada is its own beautiful and wonderful country and it has no reason to want anything other than a continuation of its storied history. This is just one of many of Donald Trump's unhinged schemes to grab attention: that's all he seems to care about. Please accept my apologies for this nonsense. Sadly, there will be more of it over the next four years. Ralph Cooke, Elkin, North Carolina Canada-as-state would be threat to Republican Senate Wyoming is the least populous of the United States, with 584,057 residents as of 2023. That makes it smaller than eight Canadian provinces. If we were to add the populations of the two remaining provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island, they would exceed that of Wyoming. If we were forced to join the United States one day, that would easily add nine states on top of the 50 that exist now. As a consequence, we would presumably send 18 senators to the Senate. I am not sure that president-elect Donald Trump would appreciate this ""socialist"" contingent from the north, given the Republicans are currently struggling to maintain their Senate majority.

Wilkinson waves off Singh's idea on trade tiff; Critical minerals,2025,"Federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson was quick to shoot down NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's call to cut off critical mineral exports in response to U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's looming tariffs. ""The NDP leader honestly doesn't know what he's talking about ... in the context of finding a resolution to this challenge,"" Wilkinson told reporters at a Thursday media call-in. ""I bet he's never been involved in any serious negotiation before,"" said Wilkinson, speaking at the tail end of a two-day visit to Washington, where he touted the merits of the cross-border energy relationship directly to U.S. lawmakers. ""We are not going to negotiate in public,"" Wilkinson said. ""And we are not going to tell the Americans exactly what we were going to do."" Wilkinson called Singh's public spitballing on retaliatory measures counterproductive, but nevertheless conceded that critical minerals are a possible bargaining chip for Canadian negotiators. Singh said on Monday that Canada should fight fire with fire by countering Trump's bullying with restrictions on cross-border exports of cobalt and lithium, two elements that are critical for the production of batteries used to power cellphones and electric vehicles. ""There's no quicker way to get Donald Trump to back away from tariffs than to shut off the taps on critical minerals, which the states need very clearly,"" Singh told reporters in Ottawa. The NDP leader subsequently put out a statement on Wednesday asking for a seat at the table in Canada-U.S. trade negotiations. He also called for the inclusion of labour unions, Indigenous leaders and business groups in the Team Canada trade effort. ""Bringing all these voices to the table ... will help forge the all-hands-on-deck approach that this moment demands.""

"Saskatchewan NDP question role of lobbyist in Bunge-Viterra deal; Opposition says premier needs to detail contact between government, Solberg",2025,"Saskatchewan's NDP Opposition says the government was lobbied by a Sask. Party donor in the lead up to Bunge Ltd.'s US$8.2-billion acquisition of Viterra Ltd. Aleana Young, shadow minister of jobs and the economy, said her party opposes the deal and called on Premier Scott Moe to further elaborate on the role of Monte Solberg, a former Conservative Party MP who represented the riding of Medicine Hat. ""Premier Moe needs to detail any lobbying contact between the Saskatchewan Party government and the Bunge paid lobbyists,"" said Young during a news conference Thursday. ""Who communicated with who? When? And what was discussed?"" Young stopped short of declaring any manner of impropriety in how the lobbying was handled, but is seeking greater clarity on how it informed or influenced the government's position on the merger. According to Saskatchewan's Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists, Solberg works for the Calgary-based lobbying firm New West Public Affairs and was hired by Bunge. ""Lobbying activities include sharing general information about Bunge's Canadian and Saskatchewan operations, and how merger transaction with Viterra will strengthen the global supply chain and bring increased market access for producers,"" says a description of his activity on the registrar's website. According to publicly available donation statements, Solberg has donated $6,500 to the Saskatchewan Party since 2020. The Government of Saskatchewan is regularly lobbied by a variety of organizations and individuals, the province said in a statement provided Thursday afternoon, adding that it created the lobbyist registry ""to ensure ongoing public transparency."" ""The Government of Saskatchewan is currently evaluating the over 20 terms and conditions attached to the ... ruling to help prevent negative impacts on competition in Canada's grain and oilseed sector,"" the statement notes. ""Our priority is ensuring Saskatchewan producers continue to be competitive with access to key global markets."" Young said the deal has been opposed by agricultural producers in the province like Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) and the national group Grain Growers of Canada (GGC) has also spoken against the merger. ""It's incumbent on the premier and this government to talk about why they were lobbied, when and what was discussed, because again, this is a bad deal for Saskatchewan,"" said Young. ""On the face of it, it's selling out Saskatchewan future economic prosperity."" When news broke of the deal Wednesday, APAS sounded alarms over how the deal could affect Saskatchewan agriculture. ""The government's greenlighted the Bunge-Viterra merger but the decision sidestepped big issues like the projected $800M hit to farmers wallets and control over nearly half the Vancouver Port,"" read a public statement. Bunge is one of the world's largest crop traders and on Tuesday received approval from Ottawa to acquire Viterra, formerly the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.

Watchdog won't probe complaint on Therme:   NDP still questions 'shady deal' for spa at Ontario Place,2025,"Ontario's integrity commissioner says he will not investigate an NDP complaint that the planned Therme spa at Ontario Place got ""preferential treatment"" from Premier Doug Ford's government. Citing ""insufficient grounds"" for a probe into the actions of Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma, commissioner J. David Wake released a 15-page report Thursday following the request from New Democrat Leader Marit Stiles last October. Stiles alleged that Surma breached the Members' Integrity Act, which is ethics legislation governing MPPs, in regard to ""events connected to the Ontario Place revitalization project, including negotiation and approval of a long-term agreement with Therme Group Canada."" The integrity commissioner noted Surma, the MPP for Etobicoke Centre, was not the minister when the deal was struck, with negotiations taking place from July 2020 to April 2022, when the government approved final terms of a lease for the spa site on the west island. ""Ministers are not responsible for the actions of their predecessors,"" Wake wrote. ""Minister Surma ... did not have responsibility for Ontario Place until Aug. 29, 2022."" He added ""Ms. Stiles has made no specific allegation as to how Minister Surma, after she became the minister responsible for Ontario Place, improperly furthered Therme's interest."" In Timmins on Thursday, Stiles said her party will continue digging into the government's dealings with Austria-based Therme. ""He's not going to dig any further at this moment,"" she said of Wake. ""I just want to say that doesn't change the reality of this shady deal. Ontarians know there's something not right about this. ""Many questions still remain."" Surma thanked the integrity commissioner for his review, and said ""we are proud of the work we are doing for the taxpayers of this province and will continue to build Ontario."" The government signed a 95-year lease for Therme to locate at the Ontario Place site, which will also see a water park and new Ontario Science Centre built. Ontario Place was shuttered more than a decade ago after its attractions declined in popularity. Several groups have opposed the new development plans, saying it is public space that should be preserved for public use and not hived off to a private company.

NDP health propaganda a sucker punch to taxpayers,2025,"The Opposition Progressive Conservatives took a swipe at the NDP government this week for its recent propaganda campaign that tries to convince the public things are looking up in health care. The Tories have good reason to complain. The province is running radio ads that claim health care is improving and “there’s reason to hope.” There may be reason to hope. Hope is always good. But so far, after 15 months in government, there are no signs that health care has improved under the NDP. In some cases, including wait times for orthopedic surgery and delays in accessing diagnostic testing (such as MRIs and CT scans), things have got worse. “There’s no denying that health care in Manitoba is in crisis, yet the NDP are spending an unknown amount of taxpayer money on ads to pat themselves on the back,” said Tory health critic Kathleen Cook. “This is a grotesque display of hubris.” It’s propaganda. It’s an attempt to create the perception that the government has made great strides fixing the broken health-care system, when in fact it’s just as lousy as it was under the previous Tory government (or worse). The timing of the ads is particularly offensive. They were launched just a week after a man died in the Health Sciences Centre emergency department after waiting eight hours for care. “In the wake of a tragedy last week, where a patient died after waiting hours in the ER, these ads are not just misleading, they’re in incredibly poor taste,” Cook said in a news release. They most certainly are. The problem for the Tories, though, is they did the same thing when they were in government. In April 2022, they plastered Winnipeg with billboards that claimed they were “clearing the surgical and diagnostic backlog” from the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the province’s own data at the time showed that wait times for hip and knee surgery were longer than they had been a year earlier. Wait times for MRIs, CT scans and ultrasounds had either stayed the same or had grown since the previous summer. The billboards were pure government propaganda. A year later, just a few months before the Oct. 3, 2023 election, the Tories ran more propaganda ads, claiming they had made progress in all sorts of areas, including child care (even though wait times for child care had grown). Not surprisingly, NDP MLAs, who were then in opposition, lit their hair on fire and demanded the government stop squandering tax dollars with misleading advertising. But just like today, they did the same thing under a previous NDP government. In 2014-15, the NDP, under then-premier Greg Selinger, spent almost $1 million on a “steady growth, good jobs” propaganda campaign. The government erected hundreds of signs around the province in an attempt to create the perception it was creating new jobs through government spending (after raising the PST by one percentage point). However, it didn’t release employment figures to show where the so-called new jobs were. The Tories, then in opposition, made the same complaints they’re making today. It’s a cycle of propaganda both parties are guilty of when they’re in office. It would be far more useful if the province used advertising dollars to promote important public service messages, such as getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu. For example, in the Tampa Bay Times newspaper this week, the U.S. government bought ads to inform Floridians that: “If you’re 65 or older, you’re at 10 times the risk of hospitalization from flu, COVID-19, or RSV, than those who are 50 and younger. But updated vaccines are available and will cut your hospitalization risk in half.” The slogan they use in the ad: “Risk Less, Do More: Get the Season’s Vaccines.” It’s a public service announcement paid for by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Those are powerful, evidence-based statistics the public should be aware of. Why isn’t the Manitoba government running those types of ads? Health officials have mountains of data that could show how vaccinations reduce the risk of serious illness, hospitalization and death. Why aren’t they plastering billboards all over the city with that kind of useful public messaging? Instead, the government spends millions on propaganda ads to help boost its polling numbers and to ultimately get re-elected. It’s unethical and it’s a gross misuse of taxpayers’ money. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 17, 2025",Billboards; COVID-19 vaccines; Propaganda; Child care; Public service advertising; Medical imaging; Government spending; Job creation; Hospitalization,,2025-01-17,Winnipeg Free Press
Saskatchewan NDP questions role of lobbyist in Bunge-Viterra merger,2025,"Saskatchewan's NDP Opposition says the provincial government was lobbied by a Sask. Party donor in the lead-up to Bunge Global SA's US$8.2-billion acquisition of Viterra Ltd. U.S.-based Bunge, one of the largest crop trading companies in the world, received approval Tuesday from the Canadian government to acquire Viterra, formerly known as the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. Aleana Young, NDP shadow minister of jobs and the economy, said her party opposes the deal and called on Premier Scott Moe to further elaborate on the role of lobbyist Monte Solberg, a former Conservative Party MP who represented the riding of Medicine Hat. ""Premier Moe needs to detail any lobbying contact between the Saskatchewan Party government and the Bunge-paid lobbyists,"" said Young during a news conference Thursday. ""Who communicated with who? When? And what was discussed?"" Young stopped short of declaring any manner of impropriety in how the lobbying was handled, but she is seeking greater clarity on how it may have influenced the government's position on the merger. According to Saskatchewan's Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists, Solberg works for the Calgary-based lobbying firm New West Public Affairs and was hired by Bunge. ""Lobbying activities include sharing general information about Bunge's Canadian and Saskatchewan operations, and how merger transaction with Viterra will strengthen the global supply chain and bring increased market access for producers,"" reads a description of his activity available on the registrar's website. According to publicly available statements, Solberg has donated $6,500 to the Saskatchewan Party since 2020. The Government of Saskatchewan is regularly lobbied by a variety of organizations and individuals, said the province in a written statement provided Thursday, adding that it created the lobbyist registry ""to ensure ongoing public transparency."" Speaking to the merger, the statement says it's ""critical"" for Viterra and Bunge to have ""certainty ahead of the 2025 crop year"" and the province appreciates the timing of the federal government's ruling. ""The Government of Saskatchewan is currently evaluating the over 20 terms and conditions attached to the ... ruling to help prevent negative impacts on competition in Canada's grain and oilseed sector,"" the statement notes. ""Our priority is ensuring Saskatchewan producers continue to be competitive with access to key global markets."" Young said the deal has been opposed by groups like the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) and the Grain Growers of Canada (GGC). ""It's incumbent on the premier and this government to talk about why they were lobbied, when and what was discussed because, again, this is a bad deal for Saskatchewan,"" said Young. ""On the face of it, it's selling out Saskatchewan's future economic prosperity."" When news broke of the deal Wednesday, APAS sounded alarms over how it could affect Saskatchewan agriculture. ""The government's green-lighted the Bunge-Viterra merger but the decision sidestepped big issues like the projected $800M hit to farmers wallets and control over nearly half the Vancouver Port,"" read a public statement. A University of Saskatchewan report estimated annual losses from the merger will amount to $770 million for grain farmers. ""This deal shouldn't be going through,"" said Young. ""You have literally every single agricultural voice in the province opposing this deal for the impact that it's going to have on producers, on the economy, on economic development and the canola crush plants.""

"NDP leader 'doesn't know what he's talking about' on Trump talks, energy minister says",2025,"OTTAWA - Federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson was quick to shoot down NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's call to cut off critical mineral exports in response to President-elect Donald Trump's looming tariffs. ""The NDP leader honestly doesn't know what he's talking about... in the context of finding a resolution to this challenge,"" Wilkinson told reporters at a Thursday media call-in. ""I bet he's never been involved in any serious negotiation before,"" said Wilkinson, speaking at the tail end of a two-day visit to Washington, D.C., where he touted the merits of the Canada-U.S. energy relationship directly to American lawmakers. ""We are not going to negotiate in public,"" said Wilkinson. ""And we are not going to tell the Americans exactly what we were going to do."" Wilkinson called Singh's public spitballing on retaliatory measures counterproductive. ""This needs to be thoughtful, and there needs to be a strategy. And to be honest with you, Mr. Singh is not helping the cause of Canada by saying things like that publicly."" He nevertheless conceded that critical minerals are a possible bargaining chip for Canadian negotiators. ""There are a range of options, and certainly critical minerals may be part of that conversation... but we are not interested in this being an escalatory issue,"" said Wilkinson. Singh said on Monday that Canada should fight fire with fire by countering Trump's bullying with restrictions on cross-border exports of cobalt and lithium, two elements that are critical for the production of batteries used to power things like cell phones and electric vehicles. ""There's no quicker way to get Donald Trump to back away from tariffs than to shut off the taps on critical minerals, which the states need very clearly,"" Singh told reporters in Ottawa Singh called on all political leaders to support his proposal. The NDP leader subsequently put out a statement on Wednesday asking for a seat at the table in Canada-U.S. trade negotiations. ""(T)he leaders of all federal parties represented in Parliament... need to be brought together immediately to chart a united response to Donald Trump's tariffs,"" wrote Singh. He also called for the inclusion of labour unions, Indigenous leaders and business groups in the Team Canada trade effort. ""Bringing all these voices to the table... will help forge the all-hands-on-deck approach that this moment demands.""

Adam Pankratz: The B.C. NDP's plan to destroy the province's mining sector,2025,"A new Indigenous consultation process for mineral exploration in British Columbia could spell the end of its mining sector. If fully realized, Premier David Eby and the B.C. NDP would effectively shut down prospecting and early-stage mining exploration, killing investment needed to keep B.C. a leader in mining and metals production. The province is bringing in a new mineral staking system, without making any legislative or regulatory changes, on March 26. Mineral staking is the first step to setting up a mine: miners are automatically granted exclusive rights to explore and develop an area of land in B.C. by staking out a claim to it and registering that claim with the government. But, under the new system that takes effect this spring, claims will no longer be automatically granted when registered with the government. Instead, there will be a staking application process in which the government will not approve any claims until First Nations groups have been consulted. Under the old way of staking a claim, written into the law in 1859, prospectors were required to literally pound stakes into the ground to be granted the right to search for minerals in that area. This system was designed to ensure that even the smallest prospector with the right intuition and a little luck would have the same opportunity at staking a major discovery as a large mining outfit. The province moved to an online system in 2005, in which mineral claims are digitally staked in a provincial online mineral tenure registry, without the need to physically set foot on the property. The upcoming change in process is a response to a court challenge launched in 2021 by the Gitxaala Nation. The First Nation challenged the claims registry at the B.C. Supreme Court, claiming it violated their constitutional rights under Section 35. In 2023, Justice Alan Ross ruled in favour of Gitxaala, noting that while the environmental impact of prospecting was limited, the spiritual impact was significant enough to warrant consultation. The B.C. government could have appealed the ruling, but it chose not to. It's not hard to see how the government's new framework for staking mining claims in B.C. is unworkable, wide open to abuse and devastating to independent prospectors and small exploration outfits. It requires prospectors to disclose where they plan to stake before they can secure the rights to do so, which is akin to forcing a company to give away intellectual property and trade secrets. Imagine requiring a tech company to disclose its proprietary idea, trade secrets or software prior to issuing a development permit. What would happen? Every tech startup in Vancouver would move to Seattle the next day. This is the gun barrel B.C.'s mining industry is staring down. Further, the cost and time burden of consultation to stake a property based on a hunch is exorbitant for the prospector and is a poor use of many First Nations' limited resources. These new requirements will ensure investment in B.C.'s mining exploration sector, already down $100 million?in 2023 compared to 2022, continues to fall. All told, the plan has serious implications for the industry, which had an $18-billion economic impact on the province in 2022 and supports 35,000 jobs. The direction of travel of B.C.'s current government is causing difficulties that extend far beyond prospecting and staking. In 2019, the B.C. Legislative Assembly unanimously passed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (DRIPA), Section 3 of which explicitly establishes the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) as the province's framework for reconciliation. DRIPA requires the B.C. government to ""take all measures necessary to ensure"" the province's laws align with UNDRIP. Further changes to the mining sector are in the works due to the province's adherence to UNDRIP: the NDP aims to reform the law that regulates mineral rights in B.C., the Mineral Tenure Act, such that it aligns with DRIPA sometime in 2026 It is important to understand that UNDRIP itself was never intended to direct the laws of Canada; its focus was primarily directed at countries without human rights guarantees or laws to protect their Indigenous peoples from real and ongoing abuses. Amen. But that doesn't mean that countries like Canada, which uphold the rule of law and believe that strong First Nations make for a better country, haven't fallen within UNDRIP's scope. In reality, UNDRIP and DRIPA are often used by overzealous anti-resource advocates to halt economic development in the province. Used as a guide, UNDRIP is a positive step to real reconciliation and should be celebrated, but it is currently being used as a blunt instrument that will cause more problems and animosity in the future. The instinct of B.C.'s current NDP government and its adherents to stymie development rather than find solutions that create prosperity should concern all British Columbians and Canadians. The federal Critical Minerals Strategy, designed to make Canada a mining superpower, is completely useless if no one can prospect, explore and build a mine; a result that would impact the future prosperity and success of everyone in our country. Prospecting is the creative destruction lab of mining. Without it, there is no future exploration and there are no future mines. Today, there are 16 proposed mines for critical minerals in B.C. Were they all to be built, B.C. would receive $36 billion of initial investment followed by an estimated $791 billion of economic?output over the mines' lifetimes. None, absolutely none, of these mines would exist without prospecting and prospectors. The newly proposed staking reforms cast a chill over investment by killing off prospecting and thereby will slow or stop new mines from being found or developed in the province. Perhaps the worst part in all of this is that the new system, despite working to protect First Nations from prospectors' claims, will also negatively impact First Nations communities that would have benefited from new mines. This is sad. Richer First Nations communities make for a stronger province and country. Mining and other resource industries have a unique ability to contribute, via First Nations partnerships, to real prosperity and reconciliation. The B.C. NDP must reconsider its planned changes to mineral staking and set prospectors free for the benefit of all British Columbians. Adam Pankratz is a lecturer at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business and a board member of Rokmaster Resources.

Ethics watchdog declines to investigate Ford minister over Ontario Place deal:   Province’s integrity commissioner says NDP leader provided ‘insufficient grounds’ in complaint against Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma,2025,"Ontario’s legislative watchdog has declined to act on a complaint by the province’s NDP leader to investigate Infrastructure Minister Kinga Surma for allegedly favouring the Austrian spa company awarded a 95-year lease on Toronto’s waterfront. Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake issued a decision on Thursday, saying he had been provided with “insufficient grounds” to launch a probe of whether Ms. Surma had violated the Members’ Integrity Act, which governs MPP ethics and conflicts of interest. Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles had submitted 1,000 pages of documentation with her complaint, demanding an investigation into the government’s move to offer to build a parking garage for spa-operator Therme Group at the province’s Ontario Place site — a benefit denied other bidders for the project. In his report, Mr. Wake said he could not proceed because Ms. Surma was not the minister responsible for awarding the Therme contract and only took over the file from Lisa MacLeod, then the heritage minister but now just a PC MPP, in August 2022, after the deal was done in May that year. Asked about the commissioner’s decision on Thursday, Ms. Stiles said the watchdog’s powers were “very narrow” and that the rules he enforces should be made stricter. She said the Ontario Place plans involve $2-billion in government subsidies, pointing to what she called a “pretty damning” Auditor-General’s report last year that concluded the process that chose Therme was unfair and lacked transparency. “While this particular issue that we put forward to the Integrity Commissioner, he’s not going to dig into anything further at this moment, I just want to say that doesn’t change the reality of this shady deal,” Ms. Stiles told reporters in Timmins, Ont. “Ontarians know there’s something not right about this.” In an e-mailed statement, Ms. Surma gave thanks for the Integrity Commissioner “taking the time to carefully review these important projects.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Gray, Jeff",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 16, 2025",Investigations,,2025-01-16,The Globe and Mail
"Tories urge NDP to save school for at-risk youth; Funding shortfall will force the closure of Surrey learning centre, board says",2025,"The B.C. Conservatives are urging the province to save the South Surrey/White Rock Learning Centre, which is to close in June if money isn't found to renew its lease, saying lives could be at risk if the centre closes. The learning centre helps vulnerable youth struggling in mainstream schools by providing ""flexible and individualized"" programming for students in grades 10 to 12 along with counselling and social work services. It also has a program that gives students a chance to volunteer in a field they are interested in working in. Local Conservative MLA Trevor Halford says he has met with a number of students who said they wouldn't be where they are today without the centre. ""This is coming down to dollars and cents, and at the end of the day, it rests on the government of B.C. to make sure that these students are receiving the proper education that they deserve,"" said Halford. The Surrey school district says the decision to not renew the lease came down to budget constraints. The district is the fastest-growing in the province and there was simply not enough money to pay for the new lease and the renovations and repairs the district says the building needs. It says students will re-join the regular school system, but will be provided with supports such as smaller classrooms. Staff will be reassigned to where they are most needed. ""The amount of money that we get every year from the provincial government has not kept pace with our expenses, and so things like inflation, dealing with the growth of the district, portables, are an issue,"" said the chair of the Surrey school board, Gary Tymoschuk. ""We just felt that this was an opportunity to save some money, and yet we will still be able to manage those kids quite well in the existing schools in the south."" The school board would not say how much money it would take to keep the learning centre open, instead pointing out that it already spends $50 million on programming for learners with diverse needs beyond its funding allotment. The Ministry of Education said in a statement that there are no plans to bail out the centre as indi-vidual school districts are responsible for making funding decisions. Hilly Schaeffer, who graduated in 2020, and Desmond Tompkins, who graduated in 2021, said the school gave them a safe place to learn at their own pace. For Schaeffer, the school was a reprieve from the inconsistency of foster care. She missed almost two years of school because of constant moves from one group home to another. She says she started at the Guildford Learning Centre, which permanently closed in November, before moving to the South Surrey location. ""It gave me the opportunity to catch up, and I actually graduated on time, even though I had an extra two years of school to complete on top of the two years of school that I still had left,"" said Schaeffer. Tompkins said the centre gave him a place to be himself after being bullied at his previous school for being queer. He said he feels for students who might not have the opportunities he got and knows many might drop out and never return to school. ""They encouraged me to pursue my passions. I got to work on a lot of passion projects while I was there, like I ran a school-wide art show for my senior year. I was able to attend a journalism workshop with CBC, and I got all these opportunities to express myself that I wouldn't have had otherwise,"" said Tompkins. He said that regardless of the cost to keep the centre open, it will cost the government and school district less in the long term because it helps students succeed and keeps them from ending up in the judicial system or from becoming reliant on employment insurance and mental health care. Keith Chalmers, whose daughter is to graduate from the centre this year, is worried some students will resort to taking their own lives if they aren't able to access additional supports. He said his daughter, who struggles with social anxiety and ADHD, has thrived since moving to the school in September and is now considering going to university after coming close to dropping out in Grade 11. ""She's feeling good about herself,"" said Chalmers. ""She's now looking at taking Calculus 12. She couldn't even do the basic math in grade 10 and 11.""","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 15, 2025",Learning centers; Students; Funding; School boards; School districts,,2025-01-15,The Vancouver Sun
"With tariff threat, forest industry decries policy review; Red flags raised on fresh NDP-Green initiative, action urged to protect jobs",2025,"The New Democrats provoked little controversy with the commitments they made to the Greens in exchange for that party's support in the legislature. Many items in the accord announced in December - such as the expansion of community health or a review of the Clean B.C. program - were already NDP priorities. Other provisions were mere agreements to talk, like the promise of a legislature committee ""to review and consider preferred methods of proportional representation."" The funding commitments - more money for community health, heat pumps and so on - were costed at $200 million, a mere fraction of the David Eby government's projected deficit of $9.4 billion. However, one item in the NDP-Green accord provoked a backlash because of the potential impact on the forest industry and the softwood lumber trade with the U.S. The New Democrats pledged to ""work with the B.C. Green caucus to undertake a review of B.C. forests with First Nations, workers, unions, business and community to address concerns around sustainability, jobs, environmental protection and the future of the industry."" Green MLAs Rob Botterell and Jeremy Valeriote ""will be fully involved in all elements of the review and the resulting report will be made public within 45 days of completion."" So said the agreement in principle released on Friday, Dec. 13. Three days later, the Council of Forest Industries put out a cautionary statement. ""Another review of forest policy in B.C. should not be a priority right now,"" said CEO Linda Coady. ""Premier Eby has already publicly acknowledged that rising U.S. duties and tariffs on forest products would have a 'devastating'impact on thousands of jobs in resource communities across the province. Now is the time for urgent action on the commitments the government has already made to maintaining a competitive and sustainable forest products manufacturing sector in B.C."" Just last year the premier pledged to address ""fibre supply shortages behind mill closures and curtailments, and what needs to be done to promote value-added wood products and protect forestry jobs."" The government should deliver on that commitment ""before another review is launched,"" urged Coady. Expanding on those concerns about the review was forester David Elstone. He's managing director of the Spar Tree group and proprietor of the View from the Stump, a newsletter on forest policy. ""The two parties in their wisdom, have agreed to a review while the B.C. forest industry is literally in its death throes,"" Elstone wrote last month. ""People, please we are in a Code Red situation, not an Orange and Green love-in when it comes to solutions and immediate action for the survival of B.C. forestry. ""President-elect Trump's proposed 25 per cent tariff on Canadian goods and the U.S. softwood lumber duties of 14.4 per cent, which are expected to double next year will bring the B.C. forest sector to a stop. If there is one thing the B.C. forest sector most definitely does not need is more uncertainty. It is the absolute worst idea at this moment in time."" Elstone, like Coady, noted how the review was at odds with statements by the new forests minister, Ravi Parmar. Within days of being appointed to the cabinet in November, Parmar was on the road in the northern half of the province, dispensing assurances to forest-industry dependent communities - Prince George, Vanderhoof, Fraser Lake, Houston - that he was already on the job. ""You do not have a guy who wants to spend the next six months developing the next flashy vision road map framework, you name it,"" he told reporter Cheryl Jahn of Prince George radio station CKPG. ""I want to get to work."" ""It is going to be a tough file,"" Parmar conceded. ""But I believe forestry in B.C. can continue to be an incredible thing for our economy and continue to deliver in big ways for workers and families right off the top."" He readily listed his three priorities: restoring confidence in the sector, standing up for workers, and following through on commitments to Indigenous people. Not on the to-do list: presiding over yet another review. ""Now is the time to be bold,"" said Parmar in a followup interview with Rob Shaw of the Northern Beat online news service. ""You are not going to see a bunch of frameworks and vision statements and grandiose plans. We've done all of that work. For me, it's now (about) focusing on those clear objectives on what we need to accomplish to have a robust, sustainable industry for the next decades."" Parmar announced his priorities before his own government and the Greens released the text of their accord. Given the centralized ways of the Eby government, Parmar may not have been consulted about what sounds very much like another grandiose and unnecessary review. The ministry may have been kept in the dark as well. The review is listed in the accord primarily as a matter of ""environment"" policy as opposed to economic growth, resource development, or job creation. That should make it clear which side of the NDP-Green relationship is calling the shots regarding the future of forestry in B.C. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 15, 2025",Forestry; Forest products; Tariffs,,2025-01-15,The Vancouver Sun
B.C. Conservative Honveer Singh Randhawa asks court to overturn NDP win in Surrey-Guildford,2025,"The challenger to the B.C. New Democrat in October's provincial election has filed a court petition asking to have Garry Begg's election victory in the Surrey-Guildford riding declared invalid. B.C. Conservative Honveer Singh Randhawa alleges that non-residents of the riding appear to have voted; that several people cast multiple ballots using similar, though not identical, names; and, most glaringly, that a group of residents at a care home cast votes by mail-in ballot despite some not speaking English or even knowing an election was being held. ""I was not aware that the provincial election was occurring,"" said Argyll Lodge resident Parminder Singh Bains in an affidavit accompanying the petition, which was translated for Singh from Punjabi. ""I did not look into any of the parties or their policies. ""I was rushed into marking the ballot, I do not know who I have voted for. ... I marked the ballot where they pointed it and I was led to believe that I had no choice but to mark the ballot, otherwise I feared that I would be kicked out of the house."" Begg received 8,947 votes to Randhawa's 8,925 in the Oct. 19 election, a 22-vote victory after a recount confirming the NDP win. According to the petition, volunteers for Randhawa knocked on doors at several homes in the riding and spoke to residents who said people whose votes were listed for that address did not live there, though some of the alleged non-resident voters owned the properties that others were renting. Other allegations are that some voters voted twice using the same address but slightly different names - such as a home on Roxburgh Road where votes by Peter Grefiel and Peter Catalan Grefiel were cast, and another on the same street where votes by Inder Jit Singh and Inderjit Tonny Singh were tallied. The most serious alleged irregularities revolve around Argyll Lodge, a residence for people, including seniors, with serious and persistent mental illness. The court documents allege 21 mail-in votes were cast by residents of the lodge, which has a 25-bed capacity. Two of those living there told Randhawa's volunteers they can't read or write in English and don't know what a mail-in ballot is. Both said that they didn't know an election was being held and had never requested a mail-in ballot. They say that on Oct. 19, a staff member told them to mark an 'X' in a box under rushed circumstances and that they don't know who they voted for. Volunteers said they visited the lodge and encountered residents who had difficulty with basic conversation or were unresponsive. Because of their communication challenges, Randhawa alleges it is likely they were subject to ""undue influence or outright ballot manipulation."" When Randhawa first made his allegations public, Argyll Lodge manager Baljit Kandola called them ""baffling"" and ""absurd,"" and said Elections B.C. has sent her business mail-in ballots for its residents every election cycle for the past 30 years. However, in a statement last week, Elections B.C. said that voters must individually request ballot packages. During the recount of the close result, Randhawa said he was stonewalled by Elections B.C. when he requested voter participation lists and counts of mail-in votes, assisted telephone votes and special and absentee ballots. Election officials told Randhawa the lists would not be made available until the recount was finished. When he finally received the list more than a month after the election, Randhawa said all he received was a list of voter ID numbers, without a breakdown of mail-in ballots or other details. He says that made searching for contraventions among the more than 19,000 votes cast difficult, especially since he was under time constraints to bring a court petition to decertify the election result. Randhawa says he has lodged a formal complaint with Elections B.C. asking for an investigation into the questionable votes cast by Argyll Lodge residents. None of the allegations in the petition filed in B.C.

"ER wait times 'unacceptable,'NDP says; 5-10 per cent of patients leave without being seen",2025,"A recently released report on Nova Scotia emergency department accountability reveals ""unacceptable"" levels of care, the opposition New Democratic Party says. ""Nova Scotians deserve timely access to care and it's disappointing that the Houston government has been unable to move the needle on emergency wait times,"" Opposition Leader Claudia Chender said in a news release. A total of 52,521 patients, or 10 per cent of patients who visited Nova Scotia Health-run emergency departments, left without being seen by a clinician during the period of April 1, 2023, to March 21, 2024, according to the Annual Accountability Report on Emergency Departments. During the same time frame, 2,080 patients, or five per per cent of patients, left the IWK emergency department without being seen by a clinician. ""This is something that the Standing Committee on Health could be discussing today, but unfortunately, the Houston government is continuing their pattern of secrecy by refusing to establish committees and answer questions about their decisions,"" Chender said. The numbers are stark but the accountability report points out that the numbers of patients departing the emergency departments without seeing a clinician is actually improving slightly. During the same period of the previous year, 8.6 per cent of patients visiting the IWK emergency department left without being seen, and the percentage of patients leaving Nova Scotia Health emergency departments without being seen by a clinician also dropped slightly from the previous year. The accountability report showed that overall emergency department visits at both the IWK and the Nova Scotia Health-run departments had decreased from the previous reporting period. In 2023-24, there were 41,829 visits to the IWK emergency, a 1.9 per cent decrease from the previous year, while there were 519,310 visits to Nova Scotia Health emergency departments, a 2.04 per cent decrease from the previous year. The number of emergency department operating hours decreased over those two fiscal years as well, the report pointed out, due to the shift in model of care to the nine urgent treatment centres in the province. The report explained that emergency department waits are measured from the time a patient is triaged to when they are seen by a clinician, a key metric as a marker of the timeliness and quality of patient care. The report goes on to say wait times are affected by several factors, including the number of patients who come to emergency departments, patient acuity, space available in the department, the length of time of the stay of patients in the department, available hospital beds outside of emergency in which to move admitted patients, and how long admitted patients stay in hospital before they are discharged. In 2023-24, the average wait time from arrival/triage to provider at the IWK emergency was one hour and 45 minutes, a 12.5 per cent decrease from the two-hour wait time from the previous year. The average emergency department wait time at Nova Scotia Health facilities from triage to provider in 2023-24 was 2.96 hours, a 5.7 per cent increase from the 2.8-hour average the previous year. Most emergency department visits were made by patients in the 17-65 age group, while almost all patients who visited the IWK emergency were under 17 years of age. Dr. Rod Wilson, the newly elected NDP member for Halifax Armdale and the party's health spokesman, said transparency is lacking in many areas of the health-care system. ""I hear from constituents often who are waiting to be attached to primary care,"" Wilson said. ""Many of them don't know where they are on the list or how much longer it will take to get off the list and ensure they have care they can rely on. Nova Scotians deserve to know what this government is doing and if it's working."" As of Jan. 2, 2025, there are 110,456 Nova Scotians on the Need a Family Practice Registry, down from 119,670 on Dec. 4, the last published number, according to a Nova Scotia Health release. In total, 9,214 people were attached or removed as a result of ongoing validation work that confirmed they had a provider in December 2024. The number of people on the need-a-provider registry accounts for 10.4 per cent of Nova Scotia's population. Nova Scotia Health will next update the Need a Family Practice registry in early February. The standing committee on health typically meets on the second Tuesday of every month to discuss key health issues but it has not met since early October. More than a month after the provincial election, the Houston government has not established when committees will resume their business, the NDP says.","Chronicle - Herald; Halifax, N.S.","Halifax, N.S.","Campbell, Francis",CNW Group Ltd.,"Jan 15, 2025",Health care access; Patients; Emergency medical care; Departments; Accountability,,2025-01-15,Chronicle - Herald
Deal with greens gives NDP four-Year Runway; Eby has less to worry about in terms of legislation and confidence votes,2025,"When the election left the New Democrats clinging to their majority by a single seat last year, they expected to face major challenges passing bills and managing the business of the legislature. Those concerns have been greatly reduced by the NDP's success in securing another working agreement with the Greens. The co-operation and responsible government accord is not as comprehensive as the confidence and supply agreement the two parties reached to install John Horgan as premier back in 2017. Nevertheless, the latest accord, announced last month, represents a major gain for the Premier David Eby-led New Democrats and improves their chance of serving a full term of government. The key clause commits the two-member B.C. Green caucus to supporting ""all confidence votes"" in the legislature, meaning those where the survival of the NDP government would be at stake. Confidence matters are broadly defined later in the text. Green MLAs Rob Botterell and Jeremy Valeriote agree to support the New Democrats on the annual motion endorsing the government's agenda as laid out in the speech from the throne. They will vote with the NDP on all motions and legislation related to supply, meaning the supply of money necessary to fund ministries, agencies and programs. They will also be there for the NDP on all stages - first, second and third readings - for any tax changes, as contained in any budget measures implementation act. They've further agreed to join the New Democrats in voting down any Opposition measure that explicitly states that the government does not have the confidence of the house. The accord also leaves the door open for the Greens and New Democrats to designate other motions and bills as a matter of confidence in the government. So much for Opposition leader John Rustad's threat to bring down the government at the first opportunity. The 44 Conservatives will be up against the combined voting strength of 46 NDP and 2 Green MLAs. Speaker Raj Chouhan would also be in reserve to break any tie in favour of the government. The Greens further agreed that their house leader - Saanich MLA Botterell - will co-operate with his NDP counterpart, government house leader Mike Farnworth, on the management of the legislature. The two will work together ""to allow for stages to be completed for passage of agreed-upon bills and motions."" Botterell agrees not to spring any bills or motions on the government first giving 48 hours'notice and discussing the implications with Farnworth. The NDP and Green caucuses ""have a shared commitment to ensuring stable governance that is focused on delivering progress and tangible outcomes for British Columbians,"" says the seven-page agreement in principle. ""Accordingly, they agree to form this political agreement (accord) to work together. ... on shared initiatives and co-operate in the legislative process to ensure good governance and respect for our democratic institutions."" The accord includes confidentiality provisions that could assist the New Democrats in keeping a lid on things until the timing suits them for release. ""Where briefings or other consultations are provided by the government to the Green caucus with respect to legislation, policy or budgetary matters, all discussions or records or information shared by government shall be confidential unless otherwise agreed."" There's also a provision for non-disclosure agreements, something the Greens have opposed in other situations. ""NDAs must be executed before there is any discussion of information by government that is subject to cabinet confidentiality including draft legislation or any type of privilege, including solicitor-client privilege or any privilege of the house."" The two parties and their leaders will co-operate and consult. This includes monthly meetings of party leaders, quarterly meetings of a team leadership main table, regular meetings of the party house leaders, and as-needed meetings involving individual MLAs. The two caucuses will release reports on ""quantitative and qualitative progress within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter."" In the event of a breakdown, ""any breaches or disagreements about progress will be discussed between house leaders."" If they cannot reach consensus, the dispute will be escalated to party leaders David Eby and Sonia Furstenau. ""No comments will be made publicly prior to a leaders' discussion.""

The terms are ""subject to annual renewal at the sole discretion of each of the parties."" Still, the text maintains that the ""accord will provide a fouryear framework for co-operation and responsible government."" It echoes Eby's aspiration to serve out a full four-year term of government. With all those guarantees of confidence, support, co-operation and confidentiality, the Greens have gone a long way to secure the NDP's position and put Eby's mind at ease. The Greens did not have as much leverage this time as back in 2017, when the NDP was several seats short of a majority. However, they did manage to secure a few concessions from the government.

Proposed Trump tariffs an 'existential threat': NDP,2025,"The head of Ontario's main Opposition party condemned U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's tariff threats as an ""existential threat"" to the province's workers during a visit to Windsor on Monday. NDP Leader Marit Stiles, at a gathering with other local NDP leaders and union representatives at the Unifor Local 444/200 union hall, urged Premier Doug Ford to abandon what she called his election-focused efforts and instead collaborate on action to protect the province's workers. ""This is a terrible position for us to be in, facing down a threat like we are facing right now, which is an existential threat to Ontario jobs and to Canadian sovereignty,"" Stiles told reporters at the press conference. ""We need everybody at the table working together,"" she said, calling on Ford's Progressive Conservative government to bring back the provincial legislature to work on an all-party plan. Trump continues to threaten to impose a universal 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian and Mexican imports once in office Jan. 20. Trump has also said he would prefer cars be built in Detroit rather than relying on the current automotive supply chain, which significantly benefits Windsor. ""Right now, it's almost like a whack-a-mole in terms of assessing what Trump might put a tariff on or not,"" MP Brian Masse (NDP - Windsor West) told reporters Monday. ""We don't know if other sectors are going to be left alone, so we have to come up with a more robust plan. It's hard to really understand what the repercussions would be, but what we can do is control some of our responses in a better, organized way."" Stiles urged the Ford government to stop focusing on a potential early election, which she believes could happen soon. ""We are ready and willing to sit down and talk about anything that it's going to take ... to keep workers employed, to keep people well, and to push back against this threat to Ontario,"" she said. ""I think it's absolutely critical. I don't think Doug Ford needs to go to the polls to get that."" During Monday's press conference, MPP Lisa Gretzky (NDP - Windsor West) warned that the threatened tariffs could create a ""dire situation"" for the region's agricultural sector. ""When you're adding tariffs and you're making it more difficult for them to get their product to market, we're going to look at even higher costs of food on our side,"" Gretzky said. In a news release issued Monday, Stiles also addressed Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner ruling that records from Doug Ford's personal phone, which he was accused of using to conduct government business, should be made public. ""Today is a step towards transparency and accountability in Ontario,"" said Stiles. ""We have seen this government use every trick in the book to keep things hidden from the public - from secret code words to ""accidental"" data wipes. Today's IPC decision means there's one less place for them to hide."" According to the news release, records revealed that Ford's government-issued phone remained unused for months, prompting the NDP to push for the release of his personal phone records. mmazak@postmedia.com","The Windsor Star; Windsor, Ont.","Windsor, Ont.","Mazak, Madeline",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 14, 2025",Press conferences; Tariffs,,2025-01-14,The Windsor Star

NDP ethics critic raises questions about Pablo Rodriguez meeting with lobbyist,2025,"Former federal heritage minister Pablo Rodriguez, who is running for the leadership of the Quebec Liberal Party, is facing questions about his decision to hold a meeting with an Ottawa lobbyist and friend about one of her clients that received funding from his department. NDP ethics critic Matthew Green said Mr. Rodriguez should not have attended the meeting with Lisa Kirbie, founder and chief executive of the consultancy Blackbird Strategies, when he was heritage minister because it created the appearance of a conflict of interest. The meeting in November, 2022, on behalf of Ms. Kirbie’s client, Kluane First Nation, was declared in the lobbying register by Ms. Kirbie, who told The Globe and Mail she did not breach any lobbying rules and conducted herself correctly. But Mr. Green said Mr. Rodriguez should have erred on the side of caution and recused himself from the meeting with Ms. Kirbie. Ministers should step aside from official meetings with friends, he said, as they could pose a potential conflict of interest under ethics rules. “Meeting with a lobbyist who is a close friend and an active advocate for a client receiving government funds creates the appearance of a conflict of interest, whether the funding was in the pipeline or not. This is really problematic all around,” Mr. Green said. “We have lots of questions to ask. There is no way he [Mr. Rodriguez] should have attended the meeting. You should not meet close friends who have a financial interest in your relationship whether you perceive it or not.” “Minister Rodriguez’s resignation in order to run for the Quebec Liberal leadership while narrowly avoiding opposition accountability because of the prorogation, still leaves the stench of insider dealings for well-connected friends of the Liberal Party,” he added. Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett, responding to questions about Mr. Rodriguez, accused Liberals of “helping their Liberal insiders and friends while Canadians suffer.” He said new allegations of unethical behaviour by Liberals are unsurprising. The race to lead the Quebec Liberal Party kicks off this week. In September, Mr. Rodriguez announced he was stepping down as a minister to sit as an Independent MP, leading up to a run for the leadership of the Quebec Liberals. Mr. Rodriguez, who was named transport minister after he was heritage minister, is not resigning as an MP until this month. As a result, there will be no by-election for his Montreal seat. No by-election is called within nine months of a fixeddate general election. In December, Mr. Rodriguez made his last speech as an MP, thanking his family, and friends in politics, including his ministerial staff and MPs of other political stripes. A spokesman for Mr. Rodriguez denied that he had broken any rules by attending the meeting with Ms. Kirbie, which was also attended by Yukon Liberal MP Brendan Hanley and Sara Korajian Rankin, a senior policy adviser in Mr. Rodriguez’s office at Canadian Heritage. Jacques Martineau, a spokesman for Mr. Rodriguez, said there are “absolutely no links” between the meeting with Ms. Kirbie and funding received by the Kluane First Nation to strengthen its Indigenous language, announced a few days later. That funding was not discussed, he said. “This funding had been approved, and the decision communicated by Heritage officials to the Kluane First Nation several months before the meeting,” he said. “Mr. Rodriguez has always followed the rules and obligations he was subject to as a public office holder, and has never provided preferential access to anyone.” Kluane First Nation was among a group of Indigenous communities in Yukon to receive part of a $14.7-million funding package from the heritage department to support Indigenous languages. The funding was announced on Nov. 25, 2022, four days after the meeting. The funding, which did not specify how much individual First Nations received, was part of an investment by the federal government of $39.4-million for Indigenous languages in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon. The subject matters discussed at the Nov. 21 meeting, according to the lobbying register, were aboriginal affairs and arts and culture. Ms. Kirbie also registered a meeting the same day with two senior heritage department officials: Mala Khanna, associate deputy minister at Canadian Heritage, and Paul Pelletier, director general for Indigenous languages. Ms. Kirbie said in a statement that the Indigenous language funding for Kluane First Nation had been agreed to months earlier and the purpose of the meeting was not to seek funding. “The contribution agreement between the Government of Canada and the Kluane First Nation for the language funding ... was signed by the Kluane First Nation on March 28, 2022. The communication with Mr. Rodriguez on November 21, 2022 took place 239 days after the contribution agreement was already signed,” she said in the statement. She added that she had fully complied with the Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct and Lobbying Act. The 2015 edition of the Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct, which applies to lobbying activity prior to July, 2023, says a lobbyist should not undertake any action that would place a public office holder in a real or apparent conflict of interest. It also says they should not lobby a public office holder with whom they share a friendship that could reasonably be seen to create a sense of obligation. Melanie Rushworth, communications director for Konrad von Finckenstein, the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, said previous investigations looked at how friendship is interpreted according to the rules. A report by former Commissioner Mario Dion interpreted the term “friend” to capture relationships where personal and professional interactions become intertwined to such an extent that it becomes difficult to draw the line between the two. Kluane First Nation did not respond to a request to comment.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Woolf, Marie",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 14, 2025",Native languages; Lobbyists; Conflicts of interest; Ethics; Friendship; Special elections; Funding; Lobbying; Political leadership,Nom: Liberal Party-Quebec Canada; NAICS: 813940,2025-01-14,The Globe and Mail

Province scraps $50-M student database:   NDP touts new education dashboard while Tories question move amid info breaches,2025,"The Manitoba government has scrapped plans to create a centralized database for student registration, report cards and other information at a cost in excess of $50 million. The Free Press has learned the initiative is not moving forward — unrelated to a series of recent cybersecurity incidents, although the Opposition Tories argue the shelved proposal, which was widely endorsed, would better protect school data. The project, spearheaded by the Progressive Conservatives when they were in government, sought to create a one-stop-shop for student, parent, teacher and school-program information. “If it wasn’t important, I wouldn’t have put my name to it,” said interim PC leader Wayne Ewasko, the education minister prior to the last election. In the spring of 2023, the Tory government issued a request for proposals to combine the Education Department’s legacy data-collection system that operates with 38 separate entities operated at the school division level. The auditor general’s office, 2019 education commission and Manitoba advocate for children and youth have all recommended the province develop a mega student-information system. Since the majority of Manitoba divisions currently pay for software by PowerSchool, <a href=""https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2025/01/09/local-student-data-accessed-in-powerschool-company-breach"" target=""_blank"" title=""Most Manitoba schools hit in cyberattack"">their internal data was leaked when the technology company was hacked over the winter break</a>. Winnipeg’s Pembina Trails School Division, a recent victim of a different cyberattack that was flagged earlier in December, is restoring internal systems, including staff payment processes that continue to be disrupted. The acting minister of education, a mother of three school-aged children, is among thousands of Manitobans who have been affected by recent events. Tracy Schmidt said she sympathizes with other caregivers in the same situation and vowed to support school divisions. At the same time, she noted that no security system is guaranteed to fully shield data from bad actors. “There is absolutely no evidence that one single system would have or could have prevented (the latest) unfortunate incident,” she said, referring to the NDP’s decision to abandon its predecessor’s consolidation project. The province has come up with a more efficient way to improve data collection than hiring a contractor to centralize it, Schmidt said, adding the price tag was estimated to be at least $50 million. A new education dashboard that draws on existing resources is in the works, per government officials. Ewasko accused the NDP of putting student and school staff information “at risk.” The Tories did not widely advertise the school data-collection overhaul as a way to bolster cybersecurity, but a government description indicated it would be “secure” and “confidential.” Families were also told they would be able to find class schedules and attendance, among other student data, more easily, while divisions were promised improved access to information, simplified workflows and faster response times to questions and concerns. Those details were deleted from Manitoba Education’s website shortly after the October 2023 election. Gustavo Valle, an information security director at Winnipeg’s Exchange Technology Services, which provides cybersecurity management services,warned against making premature assumptions about any cyberattack or placing blame until an official investigation has been completed. “Regardless of the company size, budget or staff, breaches can occur and, at the end of the day, the ability to respond to and mitigate an incident is the key factor in minimizing the impact of a cyber event,” he said. The Commission on Kindergarten to Grade 12 Education deemed a modernized data collection system a priority in its final report, for unrelated reasons. Recommendation No. 71 of 75 called for an overhaul and the related adoption of lifelong student identification numbers to increase capacity for data collection, analysis and evaluation across the education sector. The report, made public in 2021 after a year-long delay prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, described the initiative as an important step to allow partners to better collaborate on improving student achievement. Its contents were overshadowed by debate on the commission’s call to amalgamate elected school boards into mega-regional boards made up of government appointees. maggie.macintosh@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Maggie Macintosh","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Macintosh, Maggie",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 13, 2025",Cybersecurity; Data collection; Students; Education,,2025-01-13,Winnipeg Free Press
Province's job losses should be wake-up call for NDP,2025,"Premier Wab Kinew’s economic horse got a little weaker in December. Statistics Canada reported Friday Manitoba lost 7,200 jobs last month and saw its unemployment rate jump to 6.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent. Manitoba was the only province in Canada with an employment decline in December. It wasn’t a great way to start the year. Kinew frequently repeats the mantra that Manitoba needs a strong “economic horse” to “pull the social cart.” Like all provinces, Manitoba relies on good paying jobs and strong economic output to produce the tax revenues government needs to pay for front-line services in areas such as health care, education and justice and to fund municipalities. Employment is just one aspect of measuring the strength of the provincial economy, but it’s an important one. December was the second month out of the previous three where Manitoba saw a drop in employment. It’s too soon to hit the panic button — employment figures could very well take a turn for the better in January. But it’s not the way the NDP government, which is grappling with a $1.3-billion deficit in 2024-25, wanted to start the new year. Fortunately, most of the job losses in December were part-time positions. That’s not to diminish the importance of part-time work, which many households rely on to pay the bills and which governments need to help generate income taxes and consumption taxes. But it is not as bad as losing full-time jobs. Of the 7,200 jobs lost in December, about 7,000 were part-time positions. It was the second month in the fourth quarter of 2024 that Manitoba lost jobs. The province saw a net employment increase of 6,600 in November (all full-time positions as there was a decline in part-time jobs), following an employment decline of 1,300 the previous month. It’s part of the reason the provincial government, in its second-quarter financial report released last month, reduced its income tax projection for 2024-25 by $39 million. It also downgraded real economic growth for Manitoba in 2025 to 1.6 per cent from 1.9 per cent in the 2024 budget. Manitoba still has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country at 6.2 per cent (fourth lowest among the provinces). The national rate was 6.7 per cent in December. And overall, the province saw a net increase of 13,300 jobs from December 2023 to December 2024 (although part of that is from population growth of 41,200, which contributed to a labour force increase of 29,800 during that period). Still, for a province running such a deep deficit, an employment decline of any kind right now is bad news, not only because of the loss of taxation revenue but also because of the additional strain it puts on government support services, such as income assistance and rent support. It doesn’t help that both the previous Progressive Conservative government and the NDP government cut taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars, which has had a devastating impact on the provincial treasury. Growing the economy and creating net new jobs is the only way the province will eliminate the deficit over time. It’s unlikely there will be any additional support from the federal government in the form of transfer payments in the short term, beyond the regular incremental increases. There could even be a decrease in equalization payments for Manitoba if the Conservatives win the next federal election (which they almost certainly will). Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has indicated in the past he wants to make the equalization formula “fairer” for all provinces, including Alberta (which does not receive equalization). All of which means the NDP government will have to do far more to encourage private sector growth in the province through strategic investments in key industries. Last week’s announcement that the province is pouring $17 million into the aerospace sector (an $8-million grant and a $9-million loan through Magellan Aerospace) is a good example of the kind of investments that are needed. But so much more is required, including finding ways to provide startup companies with much-needed venture capital. Education and job specific training will also be critical to economic growth, as there are still severe shortages of skilled workers in many industries. Strengthening the economic horse that pulls the social cart means making smart decisions in government that contribute to economic growth. So far, Manitobans haven’t seen much of that from the Kinew government, which has been focused primarily on gimmicky policies, like bringing in a fuel tax holiday and proposing to freeze Manitoba Hydro rates. That will have to change if the province wants to grow the economy and return to a balanced budget. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 13, 2025",Provinces; Taxes; Unemployment; Economic growth; Employment; Part time employment,,2025-01-13,Winnipeg Free Press

EBY Doubles down on supportive Housing; Premier shrugs off court's ruling that NDP violated residents' right to challenge project,2025,"Premier David Eby vowed this week to impose supportive housing projects in ""every neighbourhood,"" never mind a court decision overturning the NDP government effort to expedite one such project in Kitsilano. ""I mean this is frustrating,"" Eby told reporters when asked about the B.C. Court of Appeal decision that delayed a proposed 129-unit project for residents with mental-health and drug-addiction problems. ""Everybody in B.C. knows there's a housing crisis. They see the people in the streets. They see that providing affordable housing with supports for people is part of the response to this. ""This is a project that we funded, I think now four years ago, still trying to get a shovel in the ground because of endless process."" The court did not rule on the merits of the project, which would be on Arbutus Street between 7th and 8th. Rather it overturned a provincial law that was deliberately crafted to block any further challenges to the Arbutus project by the Kitsilano Coalition for Children and Family Safety. The three-member panel of judges ruled unanimously that the province had violated the Constitution by denying the public's right to go to court and by deeming the project to be approved never mind what a court might say. Considering that the highest court in the province found the NDP government had violated the Constitution and trampled the rights of the public, one might have expected a show of contrition from a premier who formerly headed the B.C. Civil Liberties Association. But that is not Eby's way. He knows best, and never more so than when challenged over one of his projects and programs. Instead of admitting the court had a point, he's on the lookout for a workaround. ""The lawyers are having a look about what to do next,"" the premier told reporters Tuesday. ""But the court did set out a path for us to be able to move ahead on this."" The province could seek leave to take the Dec. 23 Court of Appeal judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada. It could again try to use legislation to head off further challenges by the Kitsilano coalition. Or it could let the coalition proceed with its plan to seek a judicial review of what it regards as the city's flawed approval of a flawed project. The coalition maintains it is not opposed to social housing projects, only that this one is the wrong project in the wrong place. ""The project, as proposed, would have placed 129 units of low-barrier supportive housing, including an in-house drug consumption room, a mere 17 metres from an elementary school with 450 children, a successful women's recovery home, and a toddler park,"" it argued in a news release celebrating the Court of Appeal decision. When I reported that passage on Dec. 28, B.C. Housing wrote to say that the coalition was in error. ""The building does not include an 'in-house drug consumption room'or a public safe-consumption site,"" the government's housing agency complained. ""There will be a medical room and two consultation rooms in the building. The rooms are intended for practitioners and mobile service providers to support tenants with medical, harm reduction, counselling and other supports that may be required."" However the Court of Appeal judgment acknowledged several concerns that were raised about the city's public hearing into the Arbutus project. ""Questions regarding the possibility of safe-injection sites on the property were answered in the negative, but further questioning elicited that B.C. Housing would be providing supervised injection services to tenants,"" the court noted. The city and the province had concluded a memorandum of understanding for funding the Arbutus project and four others. The memorandum was not included in the package of material provided to the public before the hearing. Yet it appeared that if the city did anything other than approve the project ""as is,"" the provincial funding would be lost. ""In the coalition's view, some of the terms ... were misrepresented at the hearing. Other questions asked by attendees were shut down and according to the coalition's pleading, its members were prevented from making their full submissions."" Those concerns suggest at least some basis for revisiting the project. But Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon has expressed doubts that the coalition would accept ""any type of housing for vulnerable people in the neighbourhood."" However the New Democrats decide to proceed on Arbutus, Eby leaves no doubt that they will be driving hard to build similar projects there and elsewhere. ""What is not up for discussion is that there will be affordable social housing in that neighbourhood,"" he declared. ""We will ensure that every neighbourhood and every community does its part in terms of responding to the housing crisis."" ""We're going to listen to communities,"" he added. ""That's an important thing for us to do. But one of the things we've also committed to do is to actually get the housing built."" He'll listen all right. Just so long as at the end of the day, everyone agrees to do it his way. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 11, 2025",Public hearings; Neighborhoods; Affordable housing; Judicial reviews,,2025-01-11,The Vancouver Sun
"NDP calls on province to avoid strike in schools; Over 3,000 support workers could walk off the job as early as Monday",2025,"Alberta's official Opposition is calling on the government to settle the ongoing labour dispute with thousands of educational assistants and support staff who are set to go on strike as soon as Monday. Unions representing 3,000 workers at the Edmonton public school board and 200 employees at the Sturgeon Public School Division have already issued strike notices.

"2025 is the make-or-break year for Nenshi; His first six months as NDP leader have fallen flat, Colin Aitchison writes",2025,"Regarded as a transformative leader during the early days of his Calgary mayoralty, Naheed Nenshi's entry into provincial politics was met with high expectations. However, his first six months at the helm of Alberta's New Democrats have been anything but a slam dunk. Nenshi's leadership to date has been underwhelming, embodied by subdued performances, an undefined narrative and a failure to seize key political moments. With Rachel Notley's recent resignation and her shadow fading, Nenshi needs to step up his performance in 2025 if he wants to stand in his own spotlight. When Nenshi won the NDP leadership, he brought a burst of energy to the province's Opposition party and to Alberta politics. Many Albertans expected the new leader to bring the charisma, gravitas and punchiness that defined his mayoralty to the Alberta legislature (although through the NDP caucus, given his lack of a seat). His record as mayor, while occasionally polarizing, suggested he could put the heat on Danielle Smith's UCP government. Known for his ability to effectively mobilize grassroots campaigns, as demonstrated during his successful leadership bid, Nenshi quickly evolved from an unknown professor to a nationally recognized civic leader who was not afraid to tackle challenges head-on. As mayor during the Calgary floods, he helped rally Calgarians during a difficult time and became known not just in Calgary and Alberta, but in other parts of the country as well. For the left-leaning in Alberta, he appeared to be the perfect new face of the Alberta NDP. A big-name politician who excelled at digital communication and message amplification, hailed for his potential to recruit new supporters under the NDP's tent. Unfortunately for them, his first six months have fallen flat, lacking any examples of the success that led him to three consecutive victories in Alberta's largest city. His last major political ""moment"" (outside of his leadership victory) could arguably be his speech at a rally in opposition to the government's gender identity policies, which occurred before he was leader. Since the race, Nenshi has struggled, at least publicly, to define what the NDP represents under his leadership. Meanwhile, Premier Danielle Smith has skilfully maintained her narrative, consolidating her popularity among conservative voters and keeping her party energized. She has successfully framed her government as a champion of Alberta, fiercely defending provincial autonomy, while also acting as an advocate for Canada on U.S. airwaves in light of president-elect Donald Trump's recent tariffannouncements. With momentum on her side, she has effectively controlled the political discourse since Nenshi took the reins of the NDP, leaving his party struggling to insert itself into the narrative. While Smith's government continues to effectively galvanize her base and fortify her position among Albertans by focusing on growing the economy, reforming health care and standing up for Alberta, Nenshi remains on the sidelines. He's the coach of his own game, though. He has the power to take himself offthe bench - a move he arguably should have made earlier. As 2025 begins, it's make or break for Nenshi. His slow start has raised questions about whether he can truly establish himself as an effective Opposition leader. So far, missed opportunities and an inability to deliver have defined his leadership. Whenever he finally takes his place in the legislature, he'll be across from a premier who has effectively solidified her position with little to no pushback from the NDP, with only two years left until Albertans return to the polls.

Ending federal NDP a progressive move; Letters to the editor,2025,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation offers a wonderful opportunity for the political fortunes of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. He should join the race to succeed Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. After all, that appears to be his natural home. The NDP - at both the federal and provincial levels - have long given up on transformative, collective, economic change in their pursuit of electability on a poorly received liberal democratic and centre-right platform. Just as Naheed Nenshi is making the provincial NDP into a liberal party in his image, Singh could do the same at the federal level by joining the Liberals. This could then lead to shutting down the tired federal NDP, thereby making room for a much-needed social democratic alternative to challenge the social, cultural, environmental and economic problems caused by growing income and wealth inequality.

Gelinas to run once again for the Ontario NDP in Nickel Belt; She has won every provincial election since 2007,2025,"France Gélinas hopes to make it five in a row. New Democrats in Nickel Belt have chosen Gélinas as their Ontario NDP candidate for the next provincial election. First elected in 2007, Gelinas has won four elections since then in a riding the NDP has dominated provincially for five decades. In 2022, Gelinas took slightly more than 50 per cent of the popular vote, easily defeating her closest rival, Randy Hazlett of the Progressive Conservatives. Algoma-Manitoulin-Kapuskasing MP Carol Hughes and Chelmsford resident Claude Berthiaume nominated Gelinas. ""I am deeply honoured and excited to once again be nominated as the Ontario NDP candidate for Nickel Belt,"" Gelinas said in a statement. ""Serving the people of this incredible community for 17 years and counting has been the privilege of a lifetime. ""I am inspired every day by the strength, resilience, and determination of the people of Nickel Belt. I am very confident that alongside the leadership, vision and dedication of our leader Marit Stiles, we will form a government that works as hard as Ontarians do. ""Together, we will work for a brighter, better future for everyone in this province."" The Progressive Conservatives now form the provincial government and do not have to call an election until June 4, 2026. However, there has been plenty of speculation in Queen's Park that Premier Doug Ford would like to call an election before a federal vote is held this year and before the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre take power in Ottawa. Polls show Poilievre heading to an easy, even historic, victory. When the provincial election is held, Stiles said she will be happy to have the veteran Nickel Belt MPP, who serves as the party's Health critic, running for the NDP. ""France's work and dedication to her community is nothing short of exemplary,"" Stiles said. ""She has been a fierce advocate for our public health care system and one of the strongest voices pushing back against Ford's privatization attempt. ""France always puts the needs of her community and our province before anything else. I am proud to have France on our team as we work to deliver a better, brighter future for the people of Ontario."" Gélinas noted that Nickel Belt is the seventh largest in the province, has 17 Ontario Parks and is comprised of over 30 communities including three First Nations. She said as the New Democratic Party's Health Critic since being elected, she ""takes pride in representing the party of Tommy Douglas, who brought us Medicare. France believes that Ontarians deserve a high-quality health care system, one that is based on needs and not on ability to pay."" Gelinas, who calls herself a proud Franco-Ontarian, lives in Whitefish with her spouse Keith. They have three children and 10 grandchildren. She said she enjoys the outdoors, loves rowing, kayaking, snowboarding, snowmobiling and is always ready for an adventure. While Gélinas was born and raised in Shawinigan, Que., she has an MBA from Laurentian University in Sudbury, is a licensed physiotherapist and an airplane pilot. She has been the executive director of the Community Health Centre of Sudbury, served on the United Way's Citizens'Advisory Panel and as president of the Francophone Reference Group of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine. sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca Bluesky: @sudburystar.bsky.social X: @SudburyStar","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.",,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 9, 2025",Provincial elections; Elections,,2025-01-09,Sudbury Star
Sask. Party revenge against NDP cities?,2025,"The Saskatchewan Party's cuts and lack of sufficient funding for housing has contributed to a meteoric rise in homelessness as people who need help and access to mental and addiction services go to where the meagre and underfunded services are, namely, the cities. The number of homeless counted skyrocketed in Saskatoon, tripling from 550 two years ago to 1,499 in 2024. Homelessness is often the result of mental health and/or addiction issues. People with adequate housing have fewer health problems and have more dignity and safety. The dogmatic ""Saskatories"" in power in Saskatchewan refuse to accept the fact that safe injection sites lower overdose rates, lower the spread of HIV and other intravenous infections, steer people to addiction and mental health assistance and save lives. All this while saving ambulance and hospital costs at the same time. Yet they refuse to fund these sites. Many people living in cities experience and are consequently forced to deal with these issues often as they travel through the city or walk the streets. And it's only going to get worse as the provincial debt rockets into orbit.

Singh destined to become a footnote,2025,"Jagmeet Singh is about to be relegated to a footnote in Canadian history. And the footnote will probably read like a joke. We can reasonably expect it to look something like this: ""Canada's scandal-riven Justin Trudeau era, from 2015 to 2024 also contained an odd era for the country's 'always a bridesmaid, never a bride'New Democratic Party, which, from 2017 on, was led by Jagmeet Singh. After leading the party's fall to fourth-place status in the House of Commons in 2019, Singh entered into a supply and confidence agreement with Trudeau's minority government in 2022. He was frequently accused of using the agreement to procure his full government pension. ""Singh was widely regarded by Canadians as a 'champagne socialist'and 'Rolex Robin Hood'for his expensive taste in fashion and cars. A lawyer, he would go on to loudly publicize that he was 'ripping apart'the supply and confidence agreement that was keeping an intensely disliked Trudeau in power. However, his dramatic proclamation was followed by zero action, as the man propped up the failing Liberal government until its dying breath. ""After the 2025 federal election, Singh was forced out of both his riding and his position as party leader. After an unsuccessful attempt at becoming a social media influencer, Singh was rarely seen in public after 2027. When he was, it was behind the tinted windows of the aging, faded Maserati he drove at the height of his political career, as his pension was not enough to maintain his lavish lifestyle. Following his departure, the NDP never regained the respectability or vote share seen during the Jack Layton years that preceded Singh."" That's it. Because what else is there to Singh, when you get down to brass tacks? (Maybe we should call it brass ""tax"" when speaking of Singh.) He offered, and provided, nothing of value to Canadians. In fact, the initiatives Singh takes credit for have been the opposite of a boon. On the NDP's website, Singh is attributed with forcing Trudeau to double the cent."" It is now both evident and widely accepted that Canada's pandemic-driven money printing madness - resulting from unscientific and harmful lockdown policies - was a disaster for our national debt and economy. If Singh did not attribute these disastrous economic programs to himself, would there be anything left for him to take recognition for? The national dental plan? He might not want credit for that one, either. It's another COVID-19 CERB payments to $2,000 per month. The praises continue from there: ""When (Trudeau) wanted to cap CERB at 16 weeks, Jagmeet made him extend it to 28 weeks. When he wanted to give employers only a 15 per cent wage subsidy Jagmeet fought and won to increase that to 75 per costly initiative, one that could backfire by paradoxically driving up the cost of dental care. Care paid for by us, the taxpayers. Still, it is doubtful Singh's very short list of political ""accomplishments"" causes him to lose any sleep. For if we asked the man to look back on his career successes, in all likelihood, he would giddily recall his most viral social media posts. He lives to be on camera, or on X or TikTok, making brash and foolish claims. Not unlike a boy child when asked what he would do if he ruled the world. ""Donald Trump is acting more like an internet troll than a president of the United States,"" Singh proclaimed in his latest X post, unaware that his screeching irony nearly blew out my MacBook speakers. If he was in power, he'd respond to Trump's tariff threats with retaliatory tariffs, he said. ""That's how you respond to a bully, you've got to respond with strength."" Cute. Singh will surely enjoy posting more of his false bravado to TikTok and X during our forthcoming election season, but he will no longer enjoy sharing a spotlight with Trudeau. Singh's spineless bootlicking-turned-outrage towards the Liberals has come to an end. The Liberal party, like Singh, will be irrelevant by the end of year. Trudeau will remain wellknown and widely despised, but Singh? Why bother? He's not worth our time. As much as Singh held Canada hostage over his pension, his vanity probably motivated him to cling to his spotlight, too. Do tears stain Maserati seats? Finally, it would be near-seditious to speak of an NDP leader without comparing him to the greatest the party ever had, Jack Layton. Layton was a respectable underdog whose speeches inspired the possibility of winning. We all - across the political spectrum - knew where Layton's heart was, and knew he believed in his own words. Singh, on the other hand, reads as a con man in a designer suit - radiating the snobbish attitude of a leader who is above being any sort of underdog (but will play one on TV). He was here to get a paycheque, to be seen and to be in charge - but not to get dirty or bloodied in a real dogfight. In the words of the man himself, ""It's the people's time."" And this time, we the ""peoplekind"" have seen enough. Your time is up, Jagmeet. May all of your future bloviating occur on TikTok, rather than in Parliament.

"Singh lost progressive, working-class support",2025,"Immediately after Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as prime minister, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh sent out a spicy statement detailing all the ways Liberals have failed Canadians. ""They let you down on health care. They let you down by allowing corporate greed to run wild. Even with the country facing another serious blow to Canadian jobs and our cost of living - this time from Donald Trump - they're still focused only on themselves and their political fate,"" Singh said. Sure, Singh's tone was assertive. But he didn't make a case for the NDP's vision so much as he positioned it as the only option for progressives. Singh should have been ready for this moment. He's had years to rally people unhappy with housing, health care, and the high cost of living in many Canadian cities behind a cohesive, populist economic message. But despite some viral social media moments and policy wins, he has ultimately failed to mobilize a leftist movement in the country. Singh and the NDP deserve credit for some things they advocated for with the supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals. They pushed to implement national dental care plan and pharmacare plans, and got 10 days of sick leave and anti-scab protections for federal workers. Yet, the Liberals have largely taken the credit for these wins. Meanwhile, the NDP is still trailing the Liberals in the polls and is firmly in third place. Because Singh has so far refused to vote non-confidence in the government, allowing Trudeau to resign, he will not be facing a deeply unpopular incumbent in the upcoming election, but a new Liberal leader, thereby reducing his chances of being able to form the official opposition. Singh took over the party in 2017. A proud Sikh man who didn't shy away from talking about systemic racism but also had a knack for social media, Singh was refreshing and optimistic. When I interviewed him in October 2017, he joked that he was ""younger and hipper"" than Trudeau. But quips and being followed by Rihanna on Instagram can only take you so far. Singh could have pushed a bolder agenda, calling for things like universal basic income and pressuring the government to build more affordable rental housing quickly, by either leveraging the supply and confidence agreement or ripping it up sooner. His plan, if elected, would be to build 500,000 affordable housing units, but he's also pushed for centrist positions such as subsidizing people's mortgages and lowering interest rates. Filling the vacuum, the Conservatives have now positioned themselves as the voice for Canada's working class and are poised to form government in the next election. ""I think the moment really asked for a more populist opportunity, a more grassroots opportunity and a long-term project of changing minds,"" author and political commentator David Moscrop told me. ""A lot of people look at the party and ... they lump the Liberals and the NDP more or less together, and that gives you effectively no space in the spectrum."" Moscrop noted that Canada had a federal social housing program until the 1980s, but said Singh and the NDP avoided going ""whole hog"" on it ""because they've run away from socialism, thinking it's a scary word."" Even in America, which worships at the altar of capitalism, Bernie Sanders found major traction by running on socialized health care and housing-for-all. But Singh has failed to galvanize or inspire leftist Canadians in the same way. After U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris decisively lost to Donald Trump, many Democrats said the party had gone too ""woke"" and it cost them the election. Now that Trudeau is on his way out, Liberal insiders have been saying the same. But the popularity of Sanders in the U.S., and even that of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's in the United Kingdom, suggest that people are hungry for bold, progressive change. Jagmeet Singh hasn't been able to meet the moment. The NDP needs a leader who can. Manisha Krishnan is an Emmy award-winning journalist who covers drug policy, and a former Toronto Star reporter.

NDP idling as MPI drives finances into ditch,2025,"Last year, when Manitoba Public Insurance got a new CEO and board appointed by the new NDP government, there was hope that its recent dysfunction would be in the rear-view mirror. Unfortunately, this week we got a reminder that the Crown corporation is still very much stuck in a muck of its own making. On Tuesday, the Public Utilities Board ordered MPI to raise auto insurance rates by an average of 5.7 per cent over the next year and approved a further $10 increase in the basic insurance premium. Add them together, and the average Autopac premium will be going up nearly 6.9 per cent. “Ordered” is the key word here. MPI had initially sought an increase of three per cent, a request that was summarily dismissed by the PUB as being insufficient, given a broad array of financial challenges. Of greater concern is the fact the PUB found MPI’s own actuaries — the highly trained people who calculate future risks and premiums — had recommended a rate increase of six per cent. That’s right. MPI asked for half of what its own people said was needed to stabilize finances and keep a lid on future rate increases. And the new CEO, Satvir Jatana, and the new board appointed by the NDP government had submitted a rate application that was an utter fiction. How remarkable is this? In its order, the PUB acknowledged that this was the first time ever that MPI asked for a rate increase that was less than its own actuarial calculations. It should be noted that the rate increase ordered by the PUB is not, in and of itself, controversial. MPI, sometimes at the PUB’s insistence, cut Autopac rates by roughly 15 per cent over the past few years. However, rising costs of vehicle repairs, hailstorms, a costly 2023 strike by unionized workers and the resumption of pre-pandemic traffic levels have combined to increase operating costs. Most of those factors are outside the public insurer’s control. However, there are other financial issues of concern that are creatures of MPI’s own creation. The PUB found that MPI continues to struggle to control its administrative costs. There were also lingering concerns about the completion of Project Nova, the chronically delayed and spectacularly inflated information technology project. Designed to give Manitobans more opportunity to acquire Autopac online, Project Nova is expected to cost more than $290 million when completed, $200 million more than its original estimate. Put it all together and the PUB remains concerned about MPI’s financial future. Although the corporation promised it would return to “financial stability within five years, the board is not confident of that based on the evidence adduced at this hearing.” With language like that, you don’t have to be an expert in actuarial calculations to know that something really bad is going on at MPI and that the NDP government needs to do something about it, quickly. Unfortunately, the government’s response is decidedly underwhelming. Justice Minister Matt Wiebe, who is responsible for overseeing MPI, told the Free Press his government supported the PUB’s order, which he said was aimed at “cleaning up the mess left by the former Progressive Conservative government.” “People are feeling it in their pocketbooks right now and they need to see that MPI is aware of that and is doing everything that they can to keep auto insurance affordable,” he said. It would be an understatement to say that Wiebe seems blissfully unaware of the broader concerns at MPI. Or, that the issues at stake in this most recent PUB order are more focused on what’s happening now, not when the Tories were in power. When you have a multibillion-dollar Crown corporation that is failing at some of the foundational tasks for which it is created, government needs to respond with a degree of urgency. Unfortunately, Wiebe’s response showed none. This is most troubling because, it should be noted, a lazy and indifferent government was at the heart of the Project Nova debacle and other instances of financial mismanagement at MPI. The PC government allowed former corporation CEO Eric Herbelin to burn money hand over fist in pursuit of the project’s completion. Herbelin hired often and indiscriminately, jacked up spending on perks such as travel and gave himself and other executives significant and completely unjustified bonuses and wage bumps. When the Free Press finally revealed the extent of the mismanagement, audits were ordered and Herbelin was unceremoniously terminated. But none of it happened until the Tories and the board they appointed were confronted by headlines about the CEO’s misdeeds. Wiebe should not need headlines to become more actively engaged with MPI. The Tories delivered a master class in what happens when government ignores the obvious signs of trouble at a valuable Crown corporation. Wiebe and the government will now either work closely with MPI’s board and executive team to get it back in its proper lane, or allow it continue weaving all over the road until it crashes head-on into Autopac customers. dan.lett@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Dan Lett","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Lett, Dan",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Jan 9, 2025",Costs; Automobile insurance,,2025-01-09,Winnipeg Free Press
Amy Hamm: Jagmeet Singh's future of irrelevancy can't come soon enough,2025,"Jagmeet Singh is about to be relegated to a footnote in Canadian history. And the footnote will probably read like a joke. We can reasonably expect it to look something like this: ""Canada's scandal-riven Justin Trudeau era, from 2015 to 2024 also contained an odd era for the country's 'always a bridesmaid, never a bride' New Democratic Party, which, from 2017 on, was led by Jagmeet Singh. After leading the party's fall to fourth-place status in the House of Commons in 2019, Singh entered into a supply and confidence agreement with Trudeau's minority government in 2022. He was frequently accused of using the agreement to procure his full government pension. ""Singh was widely regarded by Canadians as a 'champagne socialist' and 'Rolex Robin Hood' for his expensive taste in fashion and cars. A lawyer, he would go on to loudly publicize that he was 'ripping apart' the supply and confidence agreement that was keeping an intensely disliked Trudeau in power. However, his dramatic proclamation was followed by zero action, as the man propped up the failing Liberal government until its dying breath. ""After the 2025 federal election, Singh was forced out of both his riding and his position as party leader. After an unsuccessful attempt at becoming a social media influencer, Singh was rarely seen in public after 2027. When he was, it was behind the tinted windows of the aging, faded Maserati he drove at the height of his political career, as his pension was not enough to maintain his lavish lifestyle. Following his departure, the NDP never regained the respectability or vote share seen during the Jack Layton years that preceded Singh."" That's it. Because what else is there to Singh, when you get down to brass tacks? (Maybe we should call it brass ""tax"" when speaking of Singh.) He offered, and provided, nothing of value to Canadians. In fact, the initiatives Singh takes credit for have been the opposite of a boon. On the NDP's website, Singh is attributed with forcing Trudeau to double the COVID-19 CERB payments to $2,000 per month. The praises continue from there: ""When (Trudeau) wanted to cap CERB at 16 weeks, Jagmeet made him extend it to 28 weeks. When he wanted to give employers only a 15 per cent wage subsidy Jagmeet fought and won to increase that to 75 per cent."" It is now both evident and widely accepted that Canada's pandemic-driven money printing madness - resulting from unscientific and harmful lockdown policies - was a disaster for our national debt and economy If Singh did not attribute these disastrous economic programs to himself, would there be anything left for him to take recognition for? The national dental plan? He might not want credit for that one, either It's another costly initiative, one that could backfire by paradoxically driving up the cost of dental care. Care paid for by us, the taxpayers. Still, it is doubtful Singh's very short list of political ""accomplishments"" causes him to lose any sleep. For if we asked the man to look back on his career successes, in all likelihood, he would giddily recall his most viral social media posts. He lives to be on camera, or on X or TikTok, making brash and foolish claims. Not unlike a boy child when asked what he would do if he ruled the world. ""Donald Trump is acting more like an internet troll than a president of the United States,"" Singh proclaimed in his latest X post, unaware that his screeching irony nearly blew out my MacBook speakers. If he was in power, he'd respond to Trump's tariff threats with retaliatory tariffs, he said. ""That's how you respond to a bully, you've got to respond with strength."" Cute. Singh will surely enjoy posting more of his false bravado to TikTok and X during our forthcoming (not soon enough) election season, but he will no longer enjoy sharing a spotlight with Trudeau. Singh's spineless bootlicking-turned-outrage towards the Liberals has come to an end. The Liberal Party, like Singh, will be irrelevant by the end of year. Trudeau will remain well-known and widely despised, but Singh? Why bother? He's not worth our time. As much as Singh held Canada hostage over his pension, his vanity probably motivated him to cling to his spotlight, too. Do tears stain Maserati seats? Finally, it would be near-seditious to speak of an NDP leader without comparing him to the greatest the party ever had, Jack Layton. Layton was a respectable underdog whose speeches inspired the possibility of winning. We all - across the political spectrum - knew where Layton's heart was, and knew he believed in his own words. Singh, on the other hand, reads as a con man in a designer suit - radiating the snobbish attitude of a leader who is above being any sort of underdog (but will play one on TV). He was here to get a paycheque, to be seen and to be in charge - but not to get dirty or bloodied in a real dogfight. In the words of the man himself, ""It's the people's time"" And this time, we the ""peoplekind"" have seen enough. Your time is up, Jagmeet.

"2025 is the make-or-break year for Nenshi; His first six months as NDP leader have fallen flat, Colin Aitchison writes",2025,"Regarded as a transformative leader during the early days of his Calgary mayoralty, Naheed Nenshi's entry into provincial politics was met with high expectations. However, his first six months at the helm of Alberta's New Democrats have been anything but a slam dunk. Nenshi's leadership to date has been underwhelming, embodied by subdued performances, an undefined narrative and a failure to seize key political moments. With Rachel Notley's recent resignation and her shadow fading, Nenshi needs to step up his performance in 2025 if he wants to stand in his own spotlight. When Nenshi won the NDP leadership, he brought a burst of energy to the province's Opposition party and to Alberta politics. Many Albertans expected the new leader to bring the charisma, gravitas and punchiness that defined his mayoralty to the Alberta legislature (although through the NDP caucus, given his lack of a seat). His record as mayor, while occasionally polarizing, suggested he could put the heat on Danielle Smith's UCP government. Known for his ability to effectively mobilize grassroots campaigns, as demonstrated during his successful leadership bid, Nenshi quickly evolved from an unknown professor to a nationally recognized civic leader who was not afraid to tackle challenges head-on. As mayor during the Calgary floods, he helped rally Calgarians during a difficult time and became known not just in Calgary and Alberta, but in other parts of the country as well. For the left-leaning in Alberta, he appeared to be the perfect new face of the Alberta NDP. A big-name politician who excelled at digital communication and message amplification, hailed for his potential to recruit new supporters under the NDP's tent. Unfortunately for them, his first six months have fallen flat, lacking any examples of the success that led him to three consecutive victories in Alberta's largest city. His last major political ""moment"" (outside of his leadership victory) could arguably be his speech at a rally in opposition to the government's gender identity policies, which occurred before he was leader. Since the race, Nenshi has struggled, at least publicly, to define what the NDP represents under his leadership. Meanwhile, Premier Danielle Smith has skilfully maintained her narrative, consolidating her popularity among conservative voters and keeping her party energized. She has successfully framed her government as a champion of Alberta, fiercely defending provincial autonomy, while also acting as an advocate for Canada on U.S. airwaves in light of president-elect Donald Trump's recent tariff announcements. With momentum on her side, she has effectively controlled the political discourse since Nenshi took the reins of the NDP, leaving his party struggling to insert itself into the narrative. While Smith's government continues to effectively galvanize her base and fortify her position among Albertans by focusing on growing the economy, reforming health care and standing up for Alberta, Nenshi remains on the sidelines. He's the coach of his own game, though. He has the power to take himself off the bench - a move he arguably should have made earlier. As 2025 begins, it's make or break for Nenshi. His slow start has raised questions about whether he can truly establish himself as an effective Opposition leader. So far, missed opportunities and an inability to deliver have defined his leadership. Whenever he finally takes his place in the legislature, he'll be across from a premier who has effectively solidified her position with little to no pushback from the NDP, with only two years left until Albertans return to the polls.

"Mulcair: Trudeau out, Carney in?",2025,"There was sincere emotion in Justin Trudeau's voice as he met journalists outside his official residence in Ottawa on Monday, and it was easy to understand why. Agree or disagree with his politics or his policies, Trudeau has led the country for nine full years and has sacrificed a lot. That deserves recognition, respect and thanks. Trudeau may have taken too long to come to the obvious decision that he couldn't lead the Liberals into a fourth campaign but he got one thing right: There will be no ""interim leader"" between himself and the eventual winner of the Liberal leadership race ahead. At a time of deep insecurity with our American neighbours, the last thing Canada needed was more uncertainty. If the Conservatives do win, we could still find ourselves in the unprecedented situation of having three different prime ministers in as many months (Trudeau, his eventual replacement and Tory Leader Pierre Poilievre). Easy pickings for the next U.S. president, Donald Trump, during this period of instability north of the border. Now the hard part begins. The clock is ticking for the Liberals, who have set the prorogation clock as far ahead as possible. The 77 days between Trudeau's announcement and the choice of a new leader put the party on an exceptionally tight schedule. The fact that the new party leader will automatically become prime minister means that the rules governing the leadership race are important for the country as a whole. The Liberals have an obligation that far exceeds the interests of their own party. The campaign has to be fair, with evenly applied rules. The Liberals, and the country, can't afford to have the type of messy infighting that plagued the last Conservative contest. The stakes are too high. As for the candidates, there will be essentially two categories: those who've served in Trudeau's cabinet and those who will be perceived as new blood. The country has clearly signalled a profound desire for change. Anyone who served in Trudeau's cabinet will carry in their knapsack the full weight of all of his decisions - in particular regarding the economy. Despite her recent attempts to distance herself, notably by resigning from cabinet, Chrystia Freeland remains in that category as well. Trudeau went out of his way to explain that he and Freeland were close partners on all of the Liberal decisions for nearly 10 years. If that was meant as a farewell hug, he was hugging her like an anaconda. She'll have a great deal of trouble shaking off that reminder of her key role throughout Trudeau's reign. For now there are two known outsiders: former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney and former B.C. premier Christy Clark. Clark shouldn't be underestimated but her approximate knowledge of French will be a major challenge for her in a party whose leaders, for the past 60 years, have always been able to speak in both official languages well enough to take part in scrums and debates. During the weekend preceding Trudeau's announcement, Conservative MP Pierre Paul-Hus, Poilievre's very capable Quebec lieutenant, took to the airwaves to attack Carney. Say what you want about the Conservatives, I have learned through numerous examples that they are singularly well-informed about their adversaries. Their access to good polling and focus group data, just like their fundraising, far exceeds that of the other parties. Carney has been identified by the Conservatives as the only real threat to their political juggernaut as we grind our way to the next election. Poilievre will try to continue to bluff his way to victory with junior college prescriptions about the economy. Canada needs an experienced hand for our public finances, not a self-assured beginner. Carney is the real deal, who can walk the talk about our economic future - and the Conservatives know it. That's why they're so afraid of him.

Alberta NDP splitting from federal 'big brother'not such a simple task,2025,"Maserati Marxist. Rolex Rebel. First-class, pod-flying phoney. For many Albertans, that's the image of federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, a politician almost as reviled as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi is regularly mocked in UCP ads showing him between Singh and Trudeau, a big grin on his face. But Nenshi is still stuck with Singh and the federal party, despite his talk of cutting formal ties with ""big brother."" Not so easy, it turns out. The second line of the provincial NDP constitution states: ""The Party shall constitute a section of the New Democratic Party of Canada."" Clear enough. The Alberta party is a junior partner - one section - of a national movement. Buy an Alberta membership, and you're signed on with Singh's party as well. The Alberta party rules also say no bylaws may contradict ""the constitution of the New Democratic Party of Canada."" It seems the Alberta party would violate both constitutions by declaring independence. This is messy enough from a technical standpoint, but even worse as an internal NDP conflict.

She said there was room to talk about how the parties work together, but rejected ""this idea of denouncing the federal NDP."" Nenshi had prompted this blast by saying: ""I believe our ties to the federal NDP are remnants of a party that wasn't confident, a party that wasn't grown up yet, that relied on big brother to look after us."" That was popular with many of the new members he drew into the NDP, but for traditionalists like Notley it was almost treasonous. Nenshi now promises change. But it's nothing like the separation he seemed to favour in the leadership campaign. ""The members have been pretty clear with me that they want to make membership in the federal party optional for members of the provincial party,"" he told me in a yearend interview. ""I think that's a pretty common-sense thing to take to the members. ""I promised that they would have a clear decision, that we wouldn't let the decision fester, and that ultimately they would be able to vote on what they wanted to do. ""And I think we should be able to do that relatively quickly."" That's a start, but it's no divorce. On the organizational level, the Alberta party would remain a ""section."" Nenshi now argues that the link is largely meaningless anyway. ""The provincial party is quite autonomous from the federal party,"" he says. ""We're not tied together on policy at all.

"Legislative calendar long overdue, NDP leader says; Chender: Nova Scotia only province without agenda",2025,"Premier Tim Houston has often made the claim that his Progressive Conservative government can deliver more, faster for Nova Scotians. The new Opposition leader says the government is not living up to that promise when it comes to a legislative agenda. ""I have been clear for years that we need a legislative calendar,"" NDP Leader Claudia Chender said. ""Nova Scotians need to know what work is being done on their behalf and when, but governments have resisted that call so we are still in a situation where we are at the mercy of the governing party to determine when committees start, when we go back to the legislature and when any legislative activity at all starts, and my understanding from our House leader (Lisa Lachance) is that we've gotten no information on that."" Chender says Nova Scotia is the only province that operates without a legislative calendar. In April 2021, the NDP tabled bills that would set fixed hours for the days the House sits and fixed dates for the spring and fall sessions of the legislature, more specifically a spring sitting that would run from February to late May and a fall sitting that would begin in early October and extend to late November. Chender said at the time that the only argument against the change was political, particularly if something is happening that could spur negative publicity for the government. Then-premier Iain Rankin said at the time that he saw merit in looking at ways to make the legislature and MLA positions accessible to more people. Rankin said there was an opportunity for the three parties to work together toward making some changes. Premier Tim Houston, then leader of the opposition, said having regular calendar dates for the spring and fall sittings and fixed election dates would be something he'd welcome. Houston followed up on that by passing fixed-election legislation as the first law as government after being elected in August 2021. By the summer of 2024, Houston's commitment to the fixed-election date of July 15, 2025, had begun to waver. In June 2024, Houston told reporters the ""election will be when the election is,"" and that an election call would be determined by circumstances. ""I think it's really important that people have their say,"" Houston said at the time and reiterated many times after as the circumstances determined in his view that a snap fall election was necessary. Whatever the circumstances, the election call was successful as Houston and the PCs went on to win 43 seats, more than any party had previously won in Nova Scotia, while the NDP picked up nine seats and the Liberals were reduced to just two. ""I first introduced a private member's bill, strengthening our basic democratic functioning in 2018 and I've been reintroducing it ever since,"" Chender said. ""We'll certainly keep pressing. It's not for us, it's for Nova Scotians who want to understand the work that's being done."" Chender said the committees are separate, with a legislated process for a group to get together to establish the composition of the committees and to determine when they will sit. ""Once that all happens, the committees run themselves, essentially,"" she said late last week. ""Our understanding is that committees could have met as early as the day that the Speaker was elected (Dec. 10) but we received no notice of that meeting being held. ""It is at the discretion of government to convene that so it is concerning because generally those committees would start sitting now but we've had no word. Again, my understanding from the government House leader is that there is no word on when those committees would be established."" The House has six standing committees, including the all-important Public Accounts Committee that reviews public spending, reports of the auditor general and any other financial matters respecting the public funds of the province. Other standing committees are health, community services, human resources, natural resources and economic development and veterans affairs. ""Certainly we would be looking forward in the next week or two, in the natural course of events, to those meetings starting but right now, those committees haven't even been constituted,"" Chender said. ""We don't know who the members are and in some, but not all cases, we don't know who the chairs are.""","Chronicle - Herald; Halifax, N.S.","Halifax, N.S.","Campbell, Francis",CNW Group Ltd.,"Jan 7, 2025",Legislatures; Political parties,Nom: Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia; NAICS: 813940; Nom: Nova Scotia New Democratic Party; NAICS: 813940,2025-01-07,Chronicle - Herald
"Singh, Poilievre poised for election:   Party leaders say next Liberal leader will bear burden of Trudeau's legacy of bad public policy",2025,"There is no new leader that could save the Liberal minority government from an election this spring, opposition parties said Monday, as each made the case that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation does nothing to clear the stink of his unpopularity from those who will now battle to replace him. Almost immediately after Trudeau announced his intention to step down as prime minister on Monday, opposition parties argued that any Liberal leader who takes his place will bear the burden of what they argue is a legacy of bad public policy. Leaders of the federal Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and New Democratic Party made clear that they want an election as soon as possible. Since Gov. Gen. Mary Simon agreed to Trudeau's request Monday to suspend Parliament until March 24, the opposition parties will have their next chance to topple the Liberal government early this spring. ""What has really changed?"" asked Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, speaking in a video that was posted online Monday morning. ""Every Liberal MP in power today, and every potential Liberal leadership contender fighting for the top job, helped Justin Trudeau break the country over the last nine years,"" he said. ""Their only objection is (Trudeau) is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power,"" Poilievre continued. ""They want to protect their pensions and paycheque by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election to trick you and then do it all over again."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh similarly painted all Liberals with the Trudeau brush. At a virtual press conference, Singh repeatedly ruled out working with a new Liberal leader, as he did with Trudeau in a parliamentary alliance that made progress on left-wing priorities like public dental care and pharmacare coverage for diabetes medication and birth control. Singh said his NDP will vote at the first chance to declare non-confidence in the Liberal government and try to trigger an election, which he framed as a contest between his New Democrats' ""movement of working-class people"" and a Conservative party keen to cut government programs. ""It does not matter who is chosen as the next Liberal leader. They have let you down. They do not deserve another chance,"" Singh said. ""So as soon as there is a confidence vote, New Democrats will be voting against the government, and then we will have an election."" Yves-François Blanchet, the Bloc leader, also dismissed the idea that his separatist Québec party would work with Trudeau's successor. Calling the Liberal government's policies ""catastrophic,"" Blanchet argued Trudeau's administration has centralized power in Ottawa, opposed Quebec state secularism, failed to adequately support the French language and irresponsibly favoured multiculturalism in a way that has allowed hate speech, among other things. Blanchet said anyone in the Liberal party is linked to this political program, and that the government can't remake itself in a matter of weeks under a new leader ahead of an election he expects to start shortly after Parliament returns near the end of March. ""It's the same organization, the same values, the same ideology,"" Blanchet said of the Liberal party. For more than a year, national opinion polls have shown Poilievre's Conservatives hold a commanding lead in voting intentions, with the Liberals sliding down into numbers that would cause them to lose a huge number of seats. But even before Trudeau announced his intention to resign on Monday, the Conservatives have tried to tie possible successors to Trudeau's policies. The Conservatives started calling Mark Carney - the former central banker in Canada and the United Kingdom whom a source told the Star is considering a leadership run - ""Carbon Tax Carney."" That's a reference to the current Liberal government's carbon tax-and-rebate policy, which the Conservatives promise to scrap and attack as a wrong-headed climate policy that hikes costs without meaningfully cutting greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study published by the Institute for Research on Public Policy found carbon pricing has had a ""minimal"" impact on inflation, while the Canadian Climate Institute has predicted consumer carbon pricing could account for between eight and 14 per cent of Canada's projected emissions reductions by 2030. Jason Lietaer, the president of the strategic communications firm Enterprise Canada who worked for former prime minister Stephen Harper, said most Conservatives would rather face Trudeau in the next election. But he predicted Poilievre's party will be able to link any potential Liberal successor - including those who aren't serving in his government, like Carney and former British Columbia premier Christy Clark, who is also said to be mulling a run - to Trudeau's legacy in a way that benefits the Conservatives' chances in the next election. ""People aren't just tired of Trudeau. They are tired of the state of Canada"" under his government, Lietaer said. Meanwhile, the NDP sees an opportunity in Trudeau's departure - especially if he is replaced by a leader who tries to swing the Liberal party toward the right, said a senior New Democrat insider. Some Liberals have told the Star the party became damagingly associated with leftist politics under Trudeau. And the NDP believes leadership candidates might stress more fiscal conservatism, after Chrystia Freeland resigned as finance minister last month and suggested she was at odds with Trudeau over their government's spending levels, which blew past their own targets to restrain last year's budget deficit by more than $20 billion. Freeland has also been calling MPs and is interested in a potential leadership run, sources told the Star last week. Any rightward shift could open up progressive votes for the NDP, said the insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Whatever the case, though, the source added that all parties are now acting like an election is in the offing, with a possible voting day in early or mid-May if the government falls when Parliament resumes. ""We're in a campaign now,"" they said.

Chow hires NDP strategist for key role,2025,"As budget season gets underway at city hall, Mayor Olivia Chow has hired a veteran NDP organizer to run her office. A spokesperson for the mayor confirmed that Karla Webber-Gallagher, former principal secretary for the leader of the Ontario NDP, will take over as Chow's chief of staff in early February. Webber-Gallagher will replace Michal Hay, the progressive advocate who ran Chow's 2023 mayoral campaign and has held the chief of staff role since she took office in July 2023. Hay is taking parental leave, but intends to return to her job, according to the spokesperson. In a statement, Chow called Webber-Gallagher, who until March of last year was chief of staff to Hamilton Mayor Andrea Horwath, ""an experienced leader across different levels of government."" ""Karla's leadership and experience working in a city with similar challenges - and opportunities - as ours will help her hit the ground running,"" Chow said. Webber-Gallagher served as principal secretary to Horwath from 2018 to 2022 while Horwath was opposition leader for the Ontario NDP. Prior to that she was provincial director for the provincial New Democrats for almost four years, and was deputy director for the party's 2018 election campaign. As the head of Chow's office, she will be tasked with quarterbacking major initiatives like Toronto's $17-billion operating budget, and often fraught relations with the provincial and federal governments. Webber-Gallagher will join the mayor's office this month to begin the transition and officially assume her new role by Feb. 4, just one week before the mayor's budget is scheduled to go to council. City staff will launch their version of the budget next Monday, while the mayor is scheduled to present her version by Feb. 1. Hay stepping away from her job is a significant shakeup for Chow's office. An influential figure at city hall who founded the Progress Toronto advocacy group, she played key roles in the administration's early accomplishments, such as negotiating the ""new deal"" with Premier Doug Ford's government.

""I believe Alberta New Democrats can be a thoughtful government-in-waiting with real solutions for Alberta families,"" Nenshi said. ""This doesn't mean I'm leaving Calgary behind!

Premier Danielle Smith and her caucus have criticized Nenshi for not running for a seat, specifically Lethbridge-West. In response, he said he wants to represent a city he is familiar with. In a statement to Postmedia, Smith said she plans to call the byelection before June 30 and has spoken to the UCP party president and executive director and asked them to initiate a nomination process to select a UCP candidate.

Friday's letters: What do the federal NDP stand for?,2025,"""I will not vote with Pierre Poilievre to force an election because his vision is antithetical to everything I believe,"" wrote NDP MP Charles Angus justifying his declaration he will not support the Conservatives' proposed non-confidence motion on Jan. 27. This raises the question of what elements of Poilievre's vision the NDP find so odious. Is it the plan to lower middle-class taxes? Is it the idea we emphasize secure borders, rational immigration policy and an effective military? Perhaps it's resistance to the plan to control spending and return to balanced budgets? Maybe the concept we exploit our abundant natural resources to re-energize our currently dismal economic performance offends? Or possibly, it's the novel idea that dangerous criminals be incarcerated? Is it the fight to combat foreign interference or maybe the initiative to combat Liberal corruption? Like most, I have no idea for what the NDP stands. But clearly, it's not for Canadian working men or women. When we finally get to the polls, despite the NDP's resistance, I'm hopeful voters will remember that it was the NDP, Jagmeet Singh and Charlie Angus who were the willing conspirators of Justin Trudeau leading to an evisceration of our economy, national unity and international reputation. D.M. Tadman, Edmonton Jimmy Carter was no Trump It is true that the 39th president is much loved now and more appreciated than at any time during his one-term presidency. Jimmy Carter was instrumental in helping to eliminate the scourge of Guinea worm in Africa. He brought in solar-power panels to the White House to help promote that form of energy. He stated he would never lie to the American people and I don't believe he ever did. He brokered a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt that earned him a Nobel Peace Prize. Fighting against racial discrimination was a priority as president. He was a strong voice for democracy, voting rights and liberty, not only domestically, but throughout the world. His beloved wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, was cherished by him throughout his life and they were inseparable as she worked along side him in building houses for Homes for Humanity when he left office until well into his 90s. He retired to Plains, Georgia, lived modestly and taught Sunday school, reading passages from the Bible to his young pupils, (but not hawking Bibles for $60 each). Could this man be any more of a contrast to the president-elect? President Biden has declared Carter's state funeral on Jan. 9, a national holiday for the country to mourn his passing. Much deserved, as he gave so much of himself to his country and the world. Brian Iwanicki, Edmonton Letters welcome We invite you to write letters to the editor. A maximum of 150 words is preferred.

"Alberta Insider: Political rivals Smith and Nenshi look ahead to the new year:   The Premier has seemingly found a sweet spot, while the provincial NDP Leader struggled to find his footing in 2024",2025,"Good morning and Happy New Year! Now that 2024 has come to an end, Alberta’s two rival provincial political leaders are looking ahead to 2025. So what do they see? Premier Danielle Smith, emboldened by her strong showing at the United Conservative Party leadership review in November, is heading into the new year riding a wave of support. And with all eyes fixated on the shenanigans in Ottawa and the coming change of government in Washington, Smith has seemingly found a sweet spot amongst the turmoil. Her battles with the Trudeau government over everything from pensions to energy policy, daycare funding to dental care, have placed her at the forefront of provincial leaders staring down Ottawa as the country likely careens into a federal election sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, as the latest darling of U.S. cable news, Smith has garnered a reputation among some as Canada’s most effective communicator in the war of words with incoming president-elect Donald Trump. “As the federal Liberals work their stuff out, the leaders of Canada’s subnational governments look like the grown-ups in the room,” wrote The Globe’s Kelly Cryderman in her column published just before Christmas, referring to the strong words coming from Smith and some of her provincial counterparts. Of course, on the other side of Alberta’s political divide sits New Democratic Party Leader Naheed Nenshi, who took the top job in his party last June. But without a seat in the legislature, he has struggled to establish who exactly he is as a provincial leader. As The Globe’s Carrie Tait wrote in December, Nenshi “has yet to define himself and his party as sharply as [Jason] Kenney did before disgruntled conservatives replaced him with Smith in 2022.” Kenney took over under the banner: Jobs. Economy. Pipelines. Nenshi does not appear to have found similar footing yet, said pollster and political commentator Janet Brown. “Albertans still don’t know what to make of him as leader of the NDP,” she told Carrie. “Without that clear and concise message, without those three words on a podium, without a sense of what core principles of the party are under his leadership, I think people just don’t know.” So what lies ahead? For Smith, one of her first steps is heading to Washington where she will attend the Trump inauguration later this month. But the real effort is convincing the new U.S. government that Canada is not the economic enemy it wants. As Kelly wrote, her “strategy so far has been to mirror Trump’s language in interviews and on social media (‘your great American companies‚’ for example).” And while some have called for retaliation over the threat of 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods, she has “focused on his concerns around border security, including setting up her own patrols.” Nenshi has focused his efforts, albeit relatively quietly, within the province. He says the NDP manages issues like health care and education better than the other side, but Albertans tend to believe conservatives are superior when it comes to the economy, creating jobs and balancing budgets. As he told Carrie, his iteration of the NDP is working to bolster its credibility, and tarnish the UCP’s reputation, when it comes to economic issues. For his part, Nenshi disagrees that the NDP’s “core messages” are ill-defined. He said his party is focused on five: jobs, cost of living, health care, public education and public safety and crime. And also: “Helping Albertans really see that this is a government that is reckless, that is incompetent, and is dangerous.” This is the weekly Alberta newsletter written by Alberta Bureau Chief Mark Iype .

NDP's mostly smooth flight about to hit turbulence,2025,"The Kinew government’s honeymoon is over. There are no hard and fast rules on when newly elected governments can stop blaming their predecessors for the problems they face. But after more than 14 months in office, a new calendar year and a general feeling that the NDP is running out of excuses for failing to make good on many of its 2023 election pledges, it’s unlikely the Kinew government will be given much slack in 2025. The hard knocks of politics are about to set in. Premier Wab Kinew and the NDP have been riding high in public opinion polls. According to the most recent Free Press -Probe Research poll released last month, 53 per cent of Manitobans would vote for the NDP if an election were held at that time. That’s down slightly from a peak of 56 per cent in September, but up from the 45 per cent popular vote the party received in the Oct. 3, 2023, provincial election. The numbers are even more impressive in Winnipeg, where the NDP continues to gain ground. The poll shows the NDP with 61 per cent support, a gargantuan lead over the Opposition Tories, who are down to 27 per cent in the capital city. The NDP received 52 per cent popular support in Winnipeg in the last election. The party even won the constituency of Tuxedo in a June byelection, a riding the Tories had never previously lost. But that could change this year, as the public-policy headaches continue to pile up. Health care is the No. 1 thorn in the NDP’s side. Despite pledging to “fix” health care by hiring more doctors, nurses and other front-line workers, there is little evidence health care has improved. Emergency-room wait times at Winnipeg hospitals were longer in November than they were the same month in 2023. After improving slightly in the early part of last year, hospital congestion began to worsen again in the fall. Wait times for hip- and knee-replacement surgery were longer in 2024 than in 2023, according to the most recent provincial data. And wait times for MRIs, CT scans and ultrasounds all grew last year. The only glimmer of hope is wait times for cataract surgery were lower in 2024 than the previous year. Is it still too early to expect better results from a government that’s been in power only 14 months? Perhaps, but that narrative will fade in 2025 as the excuses for poor outcomes run out. Health care was the biggest focus for the NDP during the 2023 election campaign and it will be its toughest challenge in 2025. Alleviating poverty and homelessness was another major pledge by the NDP. Sadly, there appears to be little, if any, sign that government has made progress on that file. The number of encampments around the city and the daily evidence of homelessness on Winnipeg streets appears little different than it was in 2023. The Kinew government has pledged to get more people off the street and into affordable housing in 2025. However, with few details on how it plans to do so, it remains unclear if it has the infrastructure and action plan in place to achieve that goal. Affordability for Manitobans was another major plank in the NDP’s campaign platform. But with property taxes, gas prices and Winnipeg Transit fares all going up this month (not to mention little relief at the grocery store checkout), the NDP will struggle to convince voters it has made good on that pledge. The Kinew government will face other challenges in 2025, including on crime, which governments have little control over in the short term. Efforts to tackle the root causes of crime, including poverty, addiction and mental health, take years to produce results. Even then, it’s virtually impossible to show how improvements in those areas have a direct impact, since crime rates are driven by such a wide range of complicated factors. Either way, governments will always get blamed for high crime rates. If there are no improvements in that area soon, the Kinew government will feel the pinch in 2025. To add to its misery, the NDP will find it difficult to find the resources it needs to invest in all of the above areas. Part of that is the government’s own doing, after giving away hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts. But government will also be challenged by what appears to be another year of weak to modest economic growth in 2025 for Manitoba (at least according to the forecasters), which means little extra tax revenues for the provincial treasury. That’s bad news for a government saddled with a projected deficit of $1.3 billion in 2024-2025. Kinew’s “economic horse” needed to pull the “social cart” is looking more like a donkey with a bum leg than a Clydesdale. The easy road for the NDP government appears to have come to an end.

The second line of the provincial NDP constitution states: ""The Party shall constitute a section of the New Democratic Party of Canada."" Clear enough. The Alberta party is a junior partner - one section - of a national movement. Buy an Alberta membership, and you're signed on with Singh's party as well. The Alberta party rules also say no bylaws may contradict ""the constitution of the New Democratic Party of Canada."" It seems the Alberta party would violate BOTH constitutions by declaring independence. This is messy enough from a technical standpoint, but even worse as an internal NDP conflict. Just days before the leadership vote on June 22, former Premier Rachel Notley surprised nearly everyone when she told me that any plan to separate is ""silly, shortsighted, superficial."" She said there was room to talk about how the parties work together but rejected ""this idea of denouncing the federal NDP."" Former NDP leader Rachel Notley gives her concession speech in Edmonton on Monday, May 29, 2023. Alberta's Opposition NDP announced a new leader to replace her - Naheed Nenshi - on June 22, 2024. Nenshi had prompted this blast by saying: ""I believe our ties to the federal NDP are remnants of a party that wasn't confident, a party that wasn't grown up yet, that relied on big brother to look after us."" That was popular with many of the new members he drew into the NDP, but for traditionalists like Notley it was almost treasonous. Nenshi now promises change. But it's nothing like the separation he seemed to favour in the leadership campaign ""The members have been pretty clear with me that they want to make membership in the federal party optional for members of the provincial party,"" he told me in a year-end interview. ""I think that's a pretty common-sense thing to take to the members. ""I promised that they would have a clear decision, that we wouldn't let the decision fester, and that ultimately they would be able to vote on what they wanted to do. ""And I think we should be able to do that relatively quickly."" Related Braid: Nenshi's NDP takeover was 2024's most remarkable Alberta political story Braid: Big win for Nenshi's NDP leadership in high-stakes Lethbridge byelection That's a start, but it's no divorce. On the organizational level the Alberta party would remain a ""section."" Nenshi now argues that the link is largely meaningless anyway. ""The provincial party is quite autonomous from the federal party,"" he says. ""We're not tied together on policy at all. ""Since I've been the leader of the Alberta NDP, I have actually spoken with the prime minister and with (Conservative Leader) Pierre Poilievre more than I have with Jagmeet Singh. ""Jagmeet did call to congratulate me and I haven't spoken to him since."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh walks on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa, Monday, Sept. 16, 2024. The Alberta party has certainly bucked Singh and his caucus over issues like the Trans Mountain pipeline, which former Premier Notley boosted enthusiastically. Singh's caucus brought in Bill C-59, which makes energy companies prove the truth of everything they say or face fines of up to $15 million. Some of those people want oil company executives jailed as international criminals. The fact is (and they'll both hate this) the Alberta NDP is sometimes closer to Premier Danielle Smith's UCP than to its own federal party. On Thursday, another eternal irritant popped up to further rile Albertans against the national system. Alberta once again gets no equalization payment. Manitoba receives $4.7 billion, mighty Ontario mysteriously scores $546 million, and Quebec gets the usual bonanza, $13.6 billion. Singh's NDP, of course, joyously supports the system that produces numbers like that. Alberta New Democrats need their own party version of the Sovereignty Act. They can't likely win again as long as they're linked to the federal NDP.

Ousted b.c. minister decries ndp's antisemitism issue; Former mla says party's approach to middle east conflict is 'one-sided',2025,"It has been a most difficult year for Selina Robinson, who was ousted from B.C.'s NDP cabinet for her comments during a forum on Israel. She says she had long known the NDP had an antisemitism problem but has become estranged from her progressive peers since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. Robinson's comments came during an online panel discussion hosted by B'nai Brith Canada on Jan. 30, 2024. She referred to the territory on which the modern state of Israel was founded as ""a crappy piece of land with nothing on it - you know, there were several hundred thousand people but other than that, it didn't produce an economy. It couldn't grow things; it didn't have anything on it."" Her remarks sparked widespread backlash, with pro-Palestinian groups and others calling for her resignation. She issued multiple apologies and offered to take anti-Islamophobia training, but Premier David Eby condemned her comments as divisive. She stepped down as post-secondary education minister on Feb. 7, and by March was sitting as an independent. She did not seek re-election in October. She's back with a memoir, Truth Be Told, released on Dec. 18. In it, she expresses disappointment in her fellow NDP government members for their lack of support when she faced attacks due to her Jewish identity. Most distressing, she says, was the complete absence of vocal support from her colleagues in the face of racist behaviour, intimidation tactics and threats. She spoke to Dave Gordon. Q What are your feelings toward the New Democrats today? A I always used to say, Jewish values are New Democrat values. And I still believe that, but what I am seeing is that New Democrats are contradicting their own values. They've become very unprogressive, particularly the federal party, and their approach to the conflict in Israel and the Middle East is so one-sided. And the comments that I see are so antisemitic. I am sure that Jack Layton is turning over in his grave. Tom Mulcair has spoken out about it, the growth in antisemitism. He was able to shut down this level of hatred and vitriol towards Jews. And so I want voters to pay attention to who they're voting for, because I do not believe that today's New Democrats represent progressive values. I'm really hoping that the book invites people to consider ways in which the progressive movement, which I consider myself part of, is inconsistent when it comes to Jews. Q Is it your belief the New Democrats are increasing antisemitism in Canada? A Absolutely right. So this is coming for years. This isn't new. I've seen it growing over time, among extreme voices among progressives, and they have become mainstream within progressive circles. We're seeing it now in union leadership in particular, and it is so unprogressive. They don't listen to Jewish voices. The first lesson in racism is listen to those who are most impacted, but Jewish voices are completely silenced and drowned out. So what we are seeing among leftist politics and extreme voices, they're very hateful and very dangerous. I also see just politically, there's a level of pandering to extremist voices, that is I think reprehensible. As a result, the leadership of progressive federal parties, provincial parties, are aligning themselves with conservative Muslim groups that are anti-Israel. Q You argue that you were brought down not by the ""crappy piece of land,"" but because you were Jewish. Can you elaborate? A So I call myself the ""Jew and the crew."" In government under John Horgan's leadership, and then under David Eby's leadership, if there was an issue in the Jewish community, everyone came to me to address it. I grew up in the Jewish community and connected with all the synagogues. I know the Jewish leadership. There'd be questions in the legislature around the adopting of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. And everyone in cabinet would turn to Selina to answer this question. And they wanted me to - David Eby, the house leaders. I'd do a really good job and I knew they were pleased. If there was a Holocaust memorial of some kind, it was always ""Selina, are we talking to the right people? Are we engaging?"" So I was the Jew and the crew, the consultant, so to speak. So when I was the minister for post-secondary education, and antisemitism was on the rise, we were seeing it on all of our campuses. I was invited to speak on a panel about that. Of course, I should speak about that. I'm Jewish, and so I feel what the Jewish community is feeling on campus. But I'm also the minister for post-secondary education, and so had lots to say about what we were seeing on campus. And when I said those four fateful words, ""crappy piece of land,"" what the context of that was, that I was already being identified by protesters months earlier. They were already attacking me on social media, partly because I'm Jewish, and partly because I basically said that professors who are actively antisemitic, that their words are wrong and abhorrent. And celebrating the massacre of Israelis and Jews on October 7 is disgusting. I was targeted for that. When I said those words and it became public, the premier's first response to me was: ""Don't worry about it. Happens to the best of us."" And then four days later, he was telling me that I had to resign. I am pretty confident it was because I'm a Jew, and not because I was a bad minister. I think I was a damn good minister in every file that I've had. I was fired because I was creating a bit of a shit storm, I think, for the premier, and he didn't like that. The left-leaning extremists wanted me gone, and it was done to make life easier. That's how I see it. Other people think that the premier's antisemitic. People can think what they want. They'd have to ask him. Q What were your colleagues' responses? A My heart is so broken, because the people that I worked with, and for, to create something better here in British Columbia, they were so silent when people were calling for death to Jews. The lessons of the Holocaust and the lessons of any injustice is not as much the perpetrators, but as those who are the bystander, and that has been the most heartbreaking thing for me. I thought, ""Where are you?"" You stood with me, and you stood with the Jewish community, on Holocaust Memorial Day. You said, ""Never again."" You posted pictures on social media about the Jewish people; you did all the right things. And when it's here, when it's live, and when I'm shamed and afraid, you're afraid to speak? That is frightening. I was pretty devastated, so I didn't listen to media. But in writing the book, I went back to old media, and the things that the premier chose to say about me were very disappointing. He talked about ""deep wounds"" that I created for people, and how divisive I was. It made it seem like I was evil incarnate. That's what it felt like to me. I was just shocked that the premier would say those things about me, after knowing me, working with me, counting on me to deliver on many things that I have delivered on, and then to suggest that I had ""deep work to do."" The ""deep work"" is really about the work that I think New Democrats across this country need to do. I think the New Democrats have lost their way. They're engaging in very unprogressive ways. The Jewish community is saying, ""We are frightened."" Synagogues are being firebombed, schools are being shot at. And the NDP is supporting this stuff, ""Zionism is racism."" And we're saying, ""We have a right to have a national homeland, just like everybody else."" So if we really want peace, if we really say that we want to bring people together, then you bring people together. How do we engage in dialogue together, so that we can make sure that Palestinians do get a better life for themselves in the region? Demonizing Israel isn't how you do it. It just isn't. And progressives are engaging in demonizing Israel, and by extension, they're demonizing Jews. You can't separate Israel from Jews. You just can't, impossible. Q Why'd you write the book? A There's so few Jews in the world. There's so few Jews in British Columbia, most people will go through life never knowing a Jew. And so I wanted to create a place where people can perhaps get their questions answered. One of the things that happened after I was fired, just before I quit caucus, one of my New Democrat colleagues came by my office to ask some administrative questions, and she saw that I was pretty hurt. So she said something along the lines of ""I don't really know any Jews."" She lives in rural British Columbia. I thought: ""We've been colleagues for four years, and you never asked me a question about being a Jew. Like, I'm right here."" She kept saying, ""I don't understand the relationship with Israel,"" and I'm thinking, ""You've never once come to say you didn't understand something."" I wanted to create something that would allow those folks to read a little bit more about how I was sitting inside the legislature, and there's a mob of people waving flags of terrorist organizations that have just murdered thousands of people because they were Jews, and they're yelling ""Intifada,"" and literally I hear ""death to Jews."" I want them to understand how painful that was for me and for all Jews. Nobody came to see if I was OK. Nobody. So I want them to get the lesson that they failed, and they are failing the Jewish community. Q Your thoughts on how the issue of Israel has become an obsession with certain unions? A Watch what (Ontario CUPE leader) Fred Hahn is saying. I reached out to my CUPE friends, very strong supporters of mine. CUPE leadership worked on my campaigns. They basically said ""it's not our problem."" Like, are you kidding me? Hahn's celebrating the death of Jews, and you think it's not your problem? My grandfather helped build the union movement in Montreal, and now you're abandoning him and me. What is wrong with you? Q What do you hear Jewish New Democrats saying about their party? A There's been a group of Jewish progressives for the last, I would say, three to five years, poking away at the federal New Democrats to say: ""You're getting it wrong. Your obsession with Israel is problematic."" Israel is not a perfect country, but it's a democracy, and all you're doing is attacking it. You're attacking it more than you attack China, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Iran. You attack Israel more than all the other nations put together, and it's an obsession, and it's wrong, and it's antisemitic, and they don't see it, and that's the problem. I have been receiving letters from many people who support New Democrats in British Columbia, and the federal party, and telling me they're silenced about the women's rapes, or they get told October 7 never happened. They're horrified. Then (they) judge me on a ""crappy piece of land"" - which it was, because it had no natural resources. But I didn't say anything wrong, and I was attacked as if what I said was a lie. Any given federal New Democrat has said far, far worse. You get into the double standard. The hatred coming from my party - the number of times my ex-colleagues have had to apologize to the Jewish community for misusing the Holocaust as a reference. But the apologies are ridiculous.

I thought, ""Where are you?"" You stood with me, and you stood with the Jewish community, on Holocaust Memorial Day. You said, ""Never again."" You posted pictures on social media about the Jewish people; you did all the right things. And when it's here, when it's live, and when I'm shamed and afraid, you're afraid to speak? That is frightening. I was pretty devastated, so I didn't listen to media. But in writing the book, I went back to old media, and the things that the premier chose to say about me were very disappointing. He talked about ""deep wounds"" that I created for people, and how divisive I was. It made it seem like I was evil incarnate. That's what it felt like to me. I was just shocked that the premier would say those things about me, after knowing me, working with me, counting on me to deliver on many things that I have delivered on, and then to suggest that I had ""deep work to do."" The ""deep work"" is really about the work that I think New Democrats across this country need to do. I think the New Democrats have lost their way. They're engaging in very unprogressive ways. The Jewish community is saying, ""We are frightened."" Synagogues are being firebombed, schools are being shot at. And the NDP is supporting this stuff, ""Zionism is racism."" And we're saying, ""We have a right to have a national homeland, just like everybody else."" So if we really want peace, if we really say that we want to bring people together, then you bring people together. How do we engage in dialogue together, so that we can make sure that Palestinians do get a better life for themselves in the region? Demonizing Israel isn't how you do it. It just isn't. And progressives are engaging in demonizing Israel, and by extension, they're demonizing Jews. You can't separate Israel from Jews. You just can't, impossible. Q Why'd you write the book? A There's so few Jews in the world. There's so few Jews in British Columbia, most people will go through life never knowing a Jew. And so I wanted to create a place where people can perhaps get their questions answered. One of the things that happened after I was fired, just before I quit caucus, one of my New Democrat colleagues came by my office to ask some administrative questions, and she saw that I was pretty hurt. So she said something along the lines of ""I don't really know any Jews."" She lives in rural British Columbia. I thought: ""We've been colleagues for four years, and you never asked me a question about being a Jew. Like, I'm right here."" She kept saying, ""I don't understand the relationship with Israel,"" and I'm thinking, ""You've never once come to say you didn't understand something."" I wanted to create something that would allow those folks to read a little bit more about how I was sitting inside the legislature, and there's a mob of people waving flags of terrorist organizations that have just murdered thousands of people because they were Jews, and they're yelling ""Intifada,"" and literally I hear ""death to Jews."" I want them to understand how painful that was for me and for all Jews. Nobody came to see if I was OK. Nobody. So I want them to get the lesson that they failed, and they are failing the Jewish community. Q Your thoughts on how the issue of Israel has become an obsession with certain unions? A Watch what (Ontario CUPE leader) Fred Hahn is saying. I reached out to my CUPE friends, very strong supporters of mine. CUPE leadership worked on my campaigns. They basically said ""it's not our problem."" Like, are you kidding me? Hahn's celebrating the death of Jews, and you think it's not your problem? My grandfather helped build the union movement in Montreal, and now you're abandoning him and me. What is wrong with you? Q What do you hear Jewish New Democrats saying about their party? A There's been a group of Jewish progressives for the last, I would say, three to five years, poking away at the federal New Democrats to say: ""You're getting it wrong. Your obsession with Israel is problematic."" Israel is not a perfect country, but it's a democracy, and all you're doing is attacking it. You're attacking it more than you attack China, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Iran. You attack Israel more than all the other nations put together, and it's an obsession, and it's wrong, and it's antisemitic, and they don't see it, and that's the problem. I have been receiving letters from many people who support New Democrats in British Columbia, and the federal party, and telling me they're silenced about the women's rapes, or they get told October 7 never happened. They're horrified. Then (they) judge me on a ""crappy piece of land"" - which it was, because it had no natural resources. But I didn't say anything wrong, and I was attacked as if what I said was a lie. Any given federal New Democrat has said far, far worse. You get into the double standard. The hatred coming from my party - the number of times my ex-colleagues have had to apologize to the Jewish community for misusing the Holocaust as a reference. But the apologies are ridiculous.

Ousted B.C. Minister decries NDP's Antisemitism issue; Former MLA says party's approach to middle East Conflict is 'one-sided',2025,"It has been a most difficult year for Selina Robinson, who was ousted from B.C.'s NDP cabinet for her comments during a forum on Israel. She says she had long known the NDP had an antisemitism problem but has become estranged from her progressive peers since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. Robinson's comments came during an online panel discussion hosted by B'nai Brith Canada on Jan. 30, 2024. She referred to the territory on which the modern state of Israel was founded as ""a crappy piece of land with nothing on it - you know, there were several hundred thousand people but other than that, it didn't produce an economy. It couldn't grow things; it didn't have anything on it."" Her remarks sparked widespread backlash, with pro-Palestinian groups and others calling for her resignation. She issued multiple apologies and offered to take anti-Islamophobia training, but Premier David Eby condemned her comments as divisive. She stepped down as post-secondary education minister on Feb. 7, and by March was sitting as an independent. She did not seek re-election in October. She's back with a memoir, Truth Be Told, released on Dec. 18. In it, she expresses disappointment in her fellow NDP government members for their lack of support when she faced attacks due to her Jewish identity. Most distressing, she says, was the complete absence of vocal support from her colleagues in the face of racist behaviour, intimidation tactics and threats. She spoke to Dave Gordon. Q What are your feelings toward the New Democrats today? A I always used to say, Jewish values are New Democrat values. And I still believe that, but what I am seeing is that New Democrats are contradicting their own values. They've become very unprogressive, particularly the federal party, and their approach to the conflict in Israel and the Middle East is so one-sided. And the comments that I see are so antisemitic. I am sure that Jack Layton is turning over in his grave. Tom Mulcair has spoken out about it, the growth in antisemitism. He was able to shut down this level of hatred and vitriol towards Jews. And so I want voters to pay attention to who they're voting for, because I do not believe that today's New Democrats represent progressive values. I'm really hoping that the book invites people to consider ways in which the progressive movement, which I consider myself part of, is inconsistent when it comes to Jews. Q Is it your belief the New Democrats are increasing antisemitism in Canada? A Absolutely right. So this is coming for years. This isn't new. I've seen it growing over time, among extreme voices among progressives, and they have become mainstream within progressive circles. We're seeing it now in union leadership in particular, and it is so unprogressive. They don't listen to Jewish voices. The first lesson in racism is listen to those who are most impacted, but Jewish voices are completely silenced and drowned out. So what we are seeing among leftist politics and extreme voices, they're very hateful and very dangerous. I also see just politically, there's a level of pandering to extremist voices, that is I think reprehensible. As a result, the leadership of progressive federal parties, provincial parties, are aligning themselves with conservative Muslim groups that are anti-Israel. Q You argue that you were brought down not by the ""crappy piece of land,"" but because you were Jewish. Can you elaborate? A So I call myself the ""Jew and the crew."" In government under John Horgan's leadership, and then under David Eby's leadership, if there was an issue in the Jewish community, everyone came to me to address it. I grew up in the Jewish community and connected with all the synagogues. I know the Jewish leadership. There'd be questions in the legislature around the adopting of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. And everyone in cabinet would turn to Selina to answer this question. And they wanted me to - David Eby, the house leaders. I'd do a really good job and I knew they were pleased. If there was a Holocaust memorial of some kind, it was always ""Selina, are we talking to the right people? Are we engaging?"" So I was the Jew and the crew, the consultant, so to speak. So when I was the minister for post-secondary education, and antisemitism was on the rise, we were seeing it on all of our campuses. I was invited to speak on a panel about that. Of course, I should speak about that. I'm Jewish, and so I feel what the Jewish community is feeling on campus. But I'm also the minister for post-secondary education, and so had lots to say about what we were seeing on campus. And when I said those four fateful words, ""crappy piece of land,"" what the context of that was, that I was already being identified by protesters months earlier. They were already attacking me on social media, partly because I'm Jewish, and partly because I basically said that professors who are actively antisemitic, that their words are wrong and abhorrent. And celebrating the massacre of Israelis and Jews on October 7 is disgusting. I was targeted for that. When I said those words and it became public, the premier's first response to me was: ""Don't worry about it. Happens to the best of us."" And then four days later, he was telling me that I had to resign. I am pretty confident it was because I'm a Jew, and not because I was a bad minister. I think I was a damn good minister in every file that I've had. I was fired because I was creating a bit of a shit storm, I think, for the premier, and he didn't like that. The left-leaning extremists wanted me gone, and it was done to make life easier. That's how I see it. Other people think that the premier's antisemitic. People can think what they want. They'd have to ask him. Q What were your colleagues' responses? A My heart is so broken, because the people that I worked with, and for, to create something better here in British Columbia, they were so silent when people were calling for death to Jews. The lessons of the Holocaust and the lessons of any injustice is not as much the perpetrators, but as those who are the bystander, and that has been the most heartbreaking thing for me.

Builders pin cost overruns on NDP program; Community benefits agreements exclude workers not affiliated with certain unions,2025,"An NDP program to improve training for construction workers and expand opportunities for women and Indigenous Peoples has led to exploding costs and delays for major public projects, some industry groups say. Announced in 2018 by then premier John Horgan, the program, known as the community benefits agreement, requires workers on certain projects to join one of 19 unions under the umbrella of the Allied Infrastructure and Related Construction Council. It also includes rules about the percentage of apprentices, women and Indigenous workers that need to work on the project. Chris Atchison, president of the B.C. Construction Association, says the requirements have been a key reason for cost overruns of between $350 million and $500 million on major projects like the Pattullo Bridge replacement and the Broadway subway. The NDP disagrees, saying the reasons for cost overruns are inflation and labour shortages, not its rules about unions. Atchison said he hopes that the NDP might be backing away from the program, as such requirements have not been placed on the replacement of the Massey tunnel and the construction of the Steveston interchange. ""We're encouraged by the direction that the province seems to be taking. But we're not holding our breath that community benefits are not going to be applied to future projects,"" Atchison said. Chris Gardner, president of the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association of B.C., said the province is merely shifting to other forms of labour agreements. He said the difference between community benefits and typical project labour agreements is that the first excludes 85 per cent of workers not affiliated with one of the registered unions, while the second simply give workers a choice of what union to join. ""They're moving from what I would say is an offensive model - the CBA model - because it discriminates against 85 per cent of contractors and workers, decreasing the equality of opportunity, to a very bad model,"" said Gardner. ""It doesn't make any sense why a government would require a contractor to force their employees to join one of these unions to perform the work. They can perform the work without doing that."" The Ministry of Infrastructure would not say whether it is moving away from the model, simply stating that ""B.C. is using a variety of labour models ... to deliver projects that are achieving benefits for the communities they are being built in."" Former NDP minister Andrew Mercier defended the community benefits program, saying it has created numerous benefits for workers, with on-site training to help an apprentice get their Red Seal certifications in one job. A labour lawyer, Mercier says the requirements also include stipulations that there will be no strikes or disruptions during construction. He said these and other types of project labour agreements aren't new. ""Project labour agreements were brought into British Columbia in the 1960s by W.A.C. Bennett, actually a very conservative concept,"" he said. ""They solve labour supply issues for large projects, because through the requirements you become an employer of choice who are employing through a collective agreement that has pension benefits, welfare benefits, competitive wages, apprenticeships."" Administered by B.C. Infrastructure Benefits, a Crown corporation created for the program, community benefits agreements have been imposed on projects such as the Nanaimo District Hospital replacement, the Pattullo Bridge replacement and the new Broadway subway. All three projects have been beset by delays or cost overruns, and in some cases both, that some have blamed on community benefit agreements. For example, the cost of the Pattullo Bridge has increased by 20 per cent, to $1.637 billion from $1.37 billion, and its completion date was pushed from to fall 2025 from 2023. The Broadway subway has faced a budget increase of $127 million and is facing a two-year delay. It is not expected to be complete until 2027. Mercier says community benefit agreements are not to blame. He blames continuing problems with supply chains that are driving up the price of materials and labour shortages due to an aging workforce. ""I'd say that's just factually incorrect,"" said Mercier. ""Cost overruns right now are a fact of capital project procurement across North America. You can look at projects in Ontario. You can look at projects down south and see the same factors at play."" Besides cost increases, critics also say the NDP program excludes workers who don't want to unionize and prevents non-union contractors from bidding for projects. Cowichan Tribes member Jon Coleman went public in 2022 with complaints that his company, Jonco Contracting, had been prevented from working on the Cowichan District Hospital project because neither he nor his workers were unionized. Coleman said he had been assured by the province that Cowichan Tribes members would be given an exemption from the union requirement, but that never happened. Now he wants an independent audit of the hospital project that has ballooned to $1.446 billion from $887 million, and is now expected to be completed in 2027, a year behind schedule. ""It doesn't matter which union you belong to, when you have to start pulling people from out of town, paying them to do a project here, how does that not run into cost overruns?"" asked Coleman.","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 2, 2025",Independent contractors; Infrastructure; Labor contracts; Bridges; Indigent care,,2025-01-02,The Vancouver Sun

That is frightening. I was pretty devastated, so I didn't listen to media.

So I want them to get the lesson that they failed, and they are failing the Jewish community. Q Your thoughts on how the issue of Israel has become an obsession with certain unions? A Watch what (Ontario CUPE leader) Fred Hahn is saying. I reached out to my CUPE friends, very strong supporters of mine. CUPE leadership worked on my campaigns. They basically said ""it's not our problem."" Like, are you kidding me? Hahn's celebrating the death of Jews, and you think it's not your problem? My grandfather helped build the union movement in Montreal, and now you're abandoning him and me. What is wrong with you? Q What do you hear Jewish New Democrats saying about their party? A There's been a group of Jewish progressives for the last, I would say, three to five years, poking away at the federal New Democrats to say: ""You're getting it wrong. Your obsession with Israel is problematic."" Israel is not a perfect country, but it's a democracy, and all you're doing is attacking it. You're attacking it more than you attack China, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Iran. You attack Israel more than all the other nations put together, and it's an obsession, and it's wrong, and it's antisemitic, and they don't see it, and that's the problem. I have been receiving letters from many people who support New Democrats in British Columbia, and the federal party, and telling me they're silenced about the women's rapes, or they get told October 7 never happened. They're horrified. Then (they) judge me on a ""crappy piece of land"" - which it was, because it had no natural resources.

'Jack Layton is turning over in his grave': Ousted New Democrat decries party's antisemitism problem,2025,"It has been a most difficult year for Selina Robinson, who was ousted from B.C.'s NDP cabinet for her comments during a forum on Israel. She says she had long known the NDP had an antisemitism problem but has become estranged from her progressive peers since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel. Robinson's comments came during an online panel discussion hosted by B'nai Brith Canada on Jan. 30. She referred to the territory on which the modern state of Israel was founded as ""a crappy piece of land with nothing on it - you know, there were several hundred thousand people but other than that, it didn't produce an economy. It couldn't grow things; it didn't have anything on it."" Her remarks sparked widespread backlash, with pro-Palestinian groups and others calling for her resignation. She issued multiple apologies and offered to take anti-Islamophobia training, but Premier David Eby condemned her comments as divisive. She stepped down as post-secondary education minister on Feb. 7, and by March was sitting as an independent. She did not seek re-election in October. She's back with a memoir, Truth Be Told, released on Dec. 18. In it, she expresses disappointment in her fellow NDP government members for their lack of support when she faced attacks due to her Jewish identity. Most distressing, she says, was the complete absence of vocal support from her colleagues in the face of racist behaviour, intimidation tactics and threats. She spoke to Dave Gordon: What are your feelings towards the New Democrats today? I always used to say, Jewish values are New Democrat values. And I still believe that, but what I am seeing is that New Democrats are contradicting their own values. They've become very unprogressive, particularly the federal party, and their approach to the conflict in Israel and the Middle East is so one-sided. And the comments that I see are so antisemitic. I am sure that Jack Layton is turning over in his grave. Tom Mulcair has spoken out about it, the growth in antisemitism. He was able to shut down this level of hatred and vitriol towards Jews. And so I want voters to pay attention to who they're voting for, because I do not believe that today's New Democrats represent progressive values. I'm really hoping that the book invites people to consider ways in which the progressive movement, which I consider myself part of, is inconsistent when it comes to Jews. Is it your belief the New Democrats are increasing antisemitism in Canada? Absolutely right. So this is coming for years. This isn't new. I've seen it growing over time, among extreme voices among progressives, and they have become mainstream within progressive circles. We're seeing it now in union leadership in particular, and it is so unprogressive. They don't listen to Jewish voices. The first lesson in racism is listen to those who are most impacted, but Jewish voices are completely silenced and drowned out. So what we are seeing among leftist politics and extreme voices, they're very hateful and very dangerous. I also see just politically, there's a level of pandering to extremist voices, that is I think reprehensible. As a result, the leadership of progressive federal parties, provincial parties, are aligning themselves with conservative Muslim groups that are anti-Israel. You argue that you were brought down not by the ""crappy piece of land,"" but because you were Jewish. Can you elaborate? So I call myself the ""Jew and the crew."" In government under John Horgan's leadership, and then under David Eby's leadership, if there was an issue in the Jewish community, everyone came to me to address it. I grew up in the Jewish community and connected with all the synagogues. I know the Jewish leadership. There'd be questions in the legislature around the adopting of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. And everyone in cabinet would turn to Selina to answer this question. And they wanted me to - David Eby, the house leaders. I'd do a really good job and I knew they were pleased. If there was a Holocaust memorial of some kind, it was always ""Selina, are we talking to the right people? Are we engaging?"" So I was the Jew and the crew, the consultant, so to speak. So when I was the minister for post-secondary education, and antisemitism was on the rise, we were seeing it on all of our campuses. I was invited to speak on a panel about that. Of course, I should speak about that. I'm Jewish, and so I feel what the Jewish community is feeling on campus. But I'm also the minister for post-secondary education, and so had lots to say about what we were seeing on campus. And when I said those four fateful words, ""crappy piece of land,"" what the context of that was, that I was already being identified by protesters months earlier. They were already attacking me on social media, partly because I'm Jewish, and partly because I basically said that professors who are actively antisemitic, that their words are wrong and abhorrent. And celebrating the massacre of Israelis and Jews on October 7 is disgusting. I was targeted for that. When I said those words and it became public, the premier's first response to me was, ""don't worry about it. Happens to the best of us."" And then four days later, he was telling me that I had to resign. I am pretty confident it was because I'm a Jew, and not because I was a bad minister. I think I was a damn good minister in every file that I've had. I was fired because I was creating a bit of a shit storm, I think, for the premier, and he didn't like that. The left-leaning extremists wanted me gone, and it was done to make life easier. That's how I see it. Other people think that the premier's antisemitic. People can think what they want. They'd have to ask him. What were your colleagues' responses? My heart is so broken, because the people that I worked with, and for, to create something better here in British Columbia, they were so silent when people were calling for death to Jews. The lessons of the Holocaust and the lessons of any injustice is not as much the perpetrators, but as those who are the bystander, and that has been the most heartbreaking thing for me. I thought, ""Where are you?"" You stood with me, and you stood with the Jewish community, on Holocaust Memorial Day. You said, ""Never again."" You posted pictures on social media about the Jewish people; you did all the right things. And when it's here, when it's live, and when I'm shamed and afraid, you're afraid to speak? That is frightening. I was pretty devastated, so I didn't listen to media. But in writing the book, I went back to old media, and the things that the premier chose to say about me were very disappointing. He talked about, ""deep wounds"" that I created for people, and how divisive I was. It made it seem like I was evil incarnate. That's what it felt like to me. I was just shocked that the premier would say those things about me, after knowing me, working with me, counting on me to deliver on many things that I have delivered on, and then to suggest that I had ""deep work to do."" The ""deep work"" is really about the work that I think New Democrats across this country need to do. I think the New Democrats have lost their way. They're engaging in very unprogressive ways. The Jewish community is saying, ""we are frightened."" Synagogues are being firebombed, schools are being shot at. And the NDP is supporting this stuff, ""Zionism is racism."" And we're saying, ""we have a right to have a national homeland, just like everybody else."" So if we really want peace, if we really say that we want to bring people together, then you bring people together. How do we engage in dialogue together, so that we can make sure that Palestinians do get a better life for themselves in the region? Demonizing Israel isn't how you do it. It just isn't. And progressives are engaging in demonizing Israel, and by extension, they're demonizing Jews. You can't separate Israel from Jews. You just can't, impossible. Why'd you write the book? There's so few Jews in the world. There's so few Jews in British Columbia, most people will go through life never knowing a Jew. And so I wanted to create a place where people can perhaps get their questions answered. One of the things that happened after I was fired, just before I quit caucus, one of my New Democrat colleagues came by my office to ask some administrative questions, and she saw that I was pretty hurt. So she said something along the lines of ""I don't really know any Jews."" She lives in rural British Columbia. I thought, ""we've been colleagues for four years, and you never asked me a question about being a Jew. Like, I'm right here."" She kept saying, ""I don't understand the relationship with Israel,"" and I'm thinking, ""You've never once come to say you didn't understand something."" I wanted to create something that would allow those folks to read a little bit more about how I was sitting inside the legislature, and there's a mob of people waving flags of terrorist organizations that have just murdered thousands of people because they were Jews, and they're yelling ""Intifada,"" and literally I hear ""death to Jews."" I want them to understand how painful that was for me and for all Jews. Nobody came to see if I was OK. Nobody. So I want them to get the lesson that they failed, and they are failing the Jewish community. My values have not changed. The left's values are broken; their values aren't consistent. They are not living up to the values they proclaim to have. There is a minority group, Jews, afraid in your community, and you are silent, because you're afraid to upend your quote-unquote supporters. Your thoughts on how the issue of Israel has become an obsession with certain unions? Watch what (Ontario CUPE leader) Fred Hahn is saying. I reached out to my CUPE friends, very strong supporters of mine. CUPE leadership worked on my campaigns. They basically said ""it's not our problem."" Like, are you kidding me? Hahn's celebrating the death of Jews, and you think it's not your problem? My grandfather helped build the union movement in Montreal, and now you're abandoning him and me. What is wrong with you? What do you hear Jewish New Democrats saying about their party? There's been a group of Jewish progressives for the last, I would say, three to five years, poking away at the federal New Democrats to say ""You're getting it wrong. Your obsession with Israel is problematic."" Israel is not a perfect country, but it's a democracy, and all you're doing is attacking it. You're attacking it more than you attack China, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Iran. You attack Israel more than all the other nations put together, and it's an obsession, and it's wrong, and it's antisemitic, and they don't see it, and that's the problem. I have been receiving letters from many people who support New Democrats in British Columbia, and the federal party, and telling me they're silenced about the women's rapes, or they get told October 7 never happened. They're horrified. Then (they) judge me on a ""crappy piece of land"" - which it was, because it had no natural resources. But I didn't say anything wrong, and I was attacked as if what I said was a lie. Any given federal New Democrat has said far, far worse. You get into the double standard. The hatred coming from my party - the number of times my ex-colleagues have had to apologize to the Jewish community for misusing the Holocaust as a reference. But the apologies are ridiculous.

Crack forms in NDP pledge to oust PM; Veteran mp says he won't back poilievre's 'procedural games'aimed at toppling trudeau,2024,"At least one NDP MP is reluctant to bring down Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government and force a federal election if it means putting Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in power. ""I have a long and consistent record of opposing Mr. Poilievre's tactics. I do not believe he is fit for leadership and will not support his procedural games,"" said NDP MP Charlie Angus, in an email to National Post, in a reference to a Conservative ploy to use the public accounts committee to quickly bring down the government in January. Angus posted to Facebook that he would ""put country first"" and would ""not vote with Pierre Poilievre to force an election."" Poilievre's Conservatives have a massive lead in the polls and would be heavily favoured to win a majority government if an election were held today. ""Canadians deserve a plan, not political brinkmanship"" wrote Angus. The MP's position clashes with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's pledge earlier this month to introduce a non-confidence motion when Parliament returns. ""If our party brings forward a motion it would be clear to me that the Trudeau government will fall,"" said Angus, although he didn't clarify if he would personally vote for the NDP non-confidence motion. Angus, who has already announced he won't be running in the next federal election, said that Trudeau's political shelf life is likely to be limited anyway, after the dramatic resignation of former finance minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Freeland resigned hours before she was set to deliver a fall economic statement that blew past the government's fiscal targets. In her resignation letter addressed to Trudeau posted on the social media site X, Freeland said she had argued for ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" in the face of serious economic threats from the United States. ""Ms. Freeland has done enormous damage to Mr. Trudeau and it's not clear how long this government will survive,"" said Angus. Since Freeland's resignation, Trudeau has weathered increasing calls from his own caucus to resign as leader, which would prompt a Liberal leadership race ahead of the upcoming federal election in 2025. New Brunswick MPWayne Long, who has been calling for Trudeau to step down since the summer, posted a letter from the Atlantic Liberal caucus addressed to the prime minister calling on him to resign. Atlantic caucus chair and Nova Scotia MP Kody Blois signed the letter, which argues that Canada needs new leadership to respond to tariff threats from incoming U.S. president Donald Trump. Blois also points to public comments by opposition leaders that they plan to vote non-confidence in the government when Parliament resumes. ""If we are to have any chance in the next election, and prevent a Pierre Poilievre government, we need new leadership with a new vision for our party and the country,"" Long wrote on Facebook. Calgar y Liberal MP George Chahal, one of the party's two MPs in Alberta, also called for Trudeau's resignation over the weekend, posting on social media a letter he sent to the president of the Liberal party. ""Our leadership is not hearing Canadians and many Liberals are ringing the fire alarm,"" wrote Chalal. Conservative MP John Williamson said Friday he plans to introduce a non-confidence motion at the next public accounts committee meeting on Jan. 7. If that motion is successful at committee, it would be forwarded to the House of Commons and could be voted on as soon as Jan. 30, triggering an election if it passes. The Conservatives brought forward three non-confidence motions during the fall sitting of the House of Commons, which the Liberals survived thanks to support from the NDP.

Slim hope of a Trudeau epiphany; NDP leader biggest wild card in days ahead,2024,"There's no rest for the wicked, so the saying goes, and both Justin Trudeau and Jagmeet Singh are going to be super busy now that the Conservatives have signalled they will force a non-confidence motion in early January. When the 12 days of Christmas are over, Singh will be tested on whether he is willing to bring down the government - as he said he would - or whether he will again choose ambiguity over action. The NDP leader may have said he would vote for a non-confidence motion, but he never said when. Singh might get a pass on having to honour his promise if the prime minister decides to prorogue Parliament and keep the Liberal government in power. Trudeau's rationale to a chagrined nation that believes he will do anything to cling to power is likely to be that, ""Now is not a good time for an election,"" with president-elect Donald Trump threatening Canada with 25 per cent tariffs. The same rationale can also be applied by the prime minister if he decides to stay on as Liberal leader (after carefully reflecting on the matter, of course). It is appropriate timing that both Singh and Trudeau are being forced to realize their predicament the day after the Feast of Epiphany on Jan. 6. On Jan. 7, the Conservatives plan to recall the public accounts committee, where they will propose a non-confidence motion in the government and then move it to the House of Commons. It could be voted on within days of the House returning from the Christmas break on Jan. 27. In his letter announcing the plan, John Williamson, the chair of the committee, said if the Liberals filibuster and delay the motion, he is prepared to hold meetings throughout all of January. As constitutional lawyer Lyle Skinner argued, there are a lot of ""ifs"" here, but the plan could work. One big ""if "" is Singh. Since ending his supply and confidence deal with the Liberals in September, the NDP leader has since lapsed into a stultifying routine where he denounces the government at every turn but continues to support it. Embarrassingly, Singh didn't even support a non-confidence motion in the House when it was phrased in the very words he used about the Liberals being ""too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people."" If Singh is searching for words to live by, Groucho Marx comes to mind: ""Those are my principles, and if you don't like them ... well, I have others."" The NDP leader hardened his position after Chrystia Freeland's explosive exit as finance minister. On the day of her departure, Singh called for Trudeau to resign, then waffled about what that meant during year-end media interviews. Finally, in a letter, he announced he would vote to bring the government down and the NDP would put forward a motion of non-confidence in the House when Parliament resumes. But will he support a Conservative non-confidence motion? Or has the festive season allowed him to concoct some more delaying machinations? Hopefully, Singh will have his own epiphany, realize that words do matter, that principled stands involve standing and not caving, and have the courage to act on his so-called convictions. And if miracles do happen, perhaps the prime minister will have an epiphany that his continued presence at the helm of the government is leading the Liberal party to disaster. The party's slide to irrelevance is fast matching its rapid descent in the polls. The latest polling aggregate by 338Canada has the Liberals winning a mere 39 seats in a federal election (a week ago, they were at 47 seats.) Turkeys don't vote for Christmas and fewer and fewer of them appear to be supporting the Liberals. Faced with those numbers, savaged by his former loyal deputy and seeing his own members rebelling, what's a prime minister to do? Resign is a possibility and let the new man or woman deal with the fallout. It might improve the Liberals'chance at the polls. Stop his political enemies in their tracks by proroguing Parliament is another possibility. Critics might claim that prorogation is a desperate move to keep the prime minister in his job, and they wouldn't be wrong. No doubt Trudeau and his acolytes are feverishly working on other possibilities to stave off the inevitable - that this government is doomed and the Conservatives are doing everything in their power to bring the day of reckoning forward. Whether Trudeau sees the light and recognizes his time is up is beside the point. The people and his party are finished with him, and the Conservatives have vowed to be the means to his end. Trudeau's ultimate epiphany should be to realize the party is over and quit before it's over for his party.

Angus, who has already announced he won't be running in the next federal election, said that Trudeau's political shelf life is likely to be limited anyway, after the dramatic resignation of former finance minister Chrystia Freeland on Dec. 16. Freeland resigned hours before she was set to deliver a fall economic statement that blew past the government's fiscal targets. In her resignation letter addressed to Trudeau posted on the social media site X, Freeland said she had argued for ""eschewing costly political gimmicks"" in the face of serious economic threats from the United States. ""Ms. Freeland has done enormous damage to Mr. Trudeau and it's not clear how long this government will survive,"" said Angus.

NDP MP opposes Tory bid to oust Liberals:   Charlie Angus criticizes Conservatives’ plan for a confidence vote after Parliament resumes,2024,"NDP MP Charlie Angus says he won’t support a Conservative motion to bring down the Liberal government, signalling a divide within his party over how and when to try to trigger the next federal election campaign. As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau continues his holiday silence about his own political future, Mr. Angus is speaking out against the Conservatives’ plan to force a confidence vote soon after the House of Commons resumes sitting on Jan. 27. The Conservatives plan to schedule a meeting of the public accounts committee before then in an effort to have that committee issue a report expressing nonconfidence in the government to the House, which could then be put to a vote. In an e-mail to The Globe on Monday, Mr. Angus said he cannot support efforts put forward by Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. “I have a long and consistent record of opposing Mr. Poilievre’s tactics. I do not believe he is fit for leadership and will not support his procedural games,” he said. “If our party brings forward a motion it would be clear to me that this parliament will not be able to continue.” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh announced on Dec. 20 – the same day Mr. Trudeau shuffled his cabinet after Chrystia Freeland’s surprise resignation from her positions of deputy prime minister and minister of finance earlier that week – that his party would vote to bring down the government. However, his open letter only said that the NDP would bring forward a clear motion of nonconfidence. The letter was silent on how it would vote on a Conservative motion. The government controls the timing of opposition days and the NDP may not get its first chance to present a motion until March. NDP House Leader Peter Julian said last week that his party “is prepared to support a committee-level non-confidence statement that describes how the Liberals let Canadians down.” But he also added that “in the past, nonconfidence motions passed at committee have not worked, so we will be ready with our own motion of non-confidence.” In response to a Facebook post quoting Mr. Julian’s comments, Mr. Angus suggested on Saturday he is prepared to break ranks with his own party and referenced U.S. president-elect Donald Trump. “I believe in our party but there are moments when we must put country first. Trump’s inauguration poses a serious threat. Canadians deserve a plan, not political brinkmanship. I will go back to Parliament to try my best. I will not vote with Pierre Poilievre to force an election because his vision is antithetical to everything I believe,” wrote Mr. Angus, who is not running for re-election. Neither Mr. Julian nor Mr. Singh’s office responded to questions Monday about Mr. Angus’s comments. Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer interpreted Mr. Angus’s comments as a sign the NDP will not vote to defeat the Liberals, calling it “the latest betrayal of workers and families” by NDP MPs “who will prop up Trudeau at any cost so they can enrich themselves while making Canadians suffer.” Conservative MP John Williamson, who chairs the public accounts committee, announced on Dec. 27 that he is scheduling committee meetings starting Jan. 7 to debate approving a committee report to the House of Commons expressing non-confidence in the government, which could then be put to a vote by the full House of Commons. Mr. Julian did not specify what precedents he was referring to, but the latest Conservative plan has drawn comparisons to events that occurred in 2005 during the Liberal minority government led by Prime Minister Paul Martin. Then, the Conservatives forced a vote in the House asking that a committee report be returned to the public accounts committee with an instruction that the committee amend its report so that it would call on the government to resign. The motion passed and the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and the NDP all said the government should resign, but the Liberals insisted the motion was procedural. The sequence of events prompted considerable political and academic debate. Simon Fraser University professor Andrew Heard wrote in the June, 2007, edition of the Canadian Journal of Political Science that the vote should have been viewed as a confidence motion. He also noted that the Liberals said at the time that if the committee followed through and that report was adopted by the House, then it would be a confidence vote. In the end, the Martin government went on to narrowly survive further confidence votes for a few months in 2005. It ultimately fell on Nov. 28 of that year on a clear motion saying the House had lost confidence in the government. That motion was put forward by then-Conservative leader Stephen Harper and seconded by then-NDP leader Jack Layton. On Sunday, New Brunswick Liberal MP Wayne Long posted a letter from Atlantic Liberal caucus chair Kody Blois to Mr. Trudeau calling on him to resign. In an e-mail to The Globe Monday, Mr. Long said he’s urging more Liberal MPs to publicly call for a new leader. “Until he says he’s stepping down, I feel he’s staying and digging in. And him staying is untenable for our party and the country,” Mr. Long said. Also on Monday, the Angus Reid Institute released a survey showing support for the Liberal Party has dropped to 16 per cent, a decline of five percentage points since Ms. Freeland’s departure. The survey has the Conservatives in front at 45 per cent, followed by the NDP at 21 per cent. The online survey of 2,261 Canadian adults was conducted from Dec. 27 to Dec. 30. Online surveys do not have a margin of error. The polling firm said the findings are “quite possibly the lowest vote intention the Liberals have ever received in the modern era.” With a report from Marieke Walsh","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 31, 2024",Political campaigns; Committees; Political leadership; Prime ministers; No confidence motions & votes; Political parties,Nom: Liberal Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940; Nom: Conservative Party-Canada; NA ICS: 813940; Nom: New Democratic Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2024-12-31,The Globe and Mail

Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer interpreted Mr. Angus’s comments as a sign the NDP will not vote to defeat the Liberals. “This is just the latest betrayal of workers and families by Sellout Jagmeet Singh and his wacko NDP MPs who will prop up Trudeau at any cost so they can enrich themselves while making Canadians suffer,” he said in a statement. Conservative MP John Williamson, who chairs the public accounts committee, announced on Dec. 27 that he is scheduling committee meetings starting Jan. 7 to debate approving a committee report to the House of Commons expressing non-confidence in the government, which could then be put to a vote by the full House of Commons. Mr. Julian did not specify what precedents he was referring to, but the latest Conservative plan has drawn comparisons to events that occurred in 2005 during the Liberal minority government led by Prime Minister Paul Martin. Then, the Conservatives forced a vote in the House asking that a committee report be returned to the public accounts committee with an instruction that the committee amend its report so that it would call on the government resign. The motion passed and the Conservatives, Bloc Québécois and the NDP all said the government should resign, but the Liberals insisted the motion was procedural. The sequence of events prompted considerable political and academic debate. Simon Fraser University professor Andrew Heard wrote in the June 2007 edition of the Canadian Journal of Political Science that the vote should have been viewed as a confidence motion. He also noted that the Liberals said at the time that if the committee followed through and that report was adopted by the House, then it would be a confidence vote. In the end, the Martin government went on to narrowly survive further confidence votes for a few months in 2005. It ultimately fell on Nov. 28 of that year on a clear motion saying the House had lost confidence in the government. That motion was put forward by then-Conservative Leader Stephen Harper and seconded by then-NDP Leader Jack Layton.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Curry, Bill",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 30, 2024",Conservatism; Political campaigns; Committees; Scandals; Political leadership; Prime ministers; No confidence motions & votes,,2024-12-30,The Globe and Mail
Sask. NDP Leader Carla Beck looks to continue building momentum in 2025,2024,"After doubling the number of MLAs on her side of the legislative chamber, Saskatchewan NDP Leader Carla Beck is looking forward to 2025 with a focus on serving as a larger, more resourced Opposition. Beck's party went from 13 seats to 27 in the provincial election on Oct. 28 while the governing Saskatchewan Party prevailed with 34 seats after winning 48 out of 61 ridings in 2020 Beck recently sat down with the Regina Leader-Post to talk about a lightning-fast, 10-day opening session of the 30th legislature while also reflecting on the recent provincial election and what she hopes the Opposition will be able to accomplish this coming year. (The following has been edited for length and clarity.) Related Leader Carla Beck says NDP has 'awakened hope' in Saskatchewan Majority rules: Saskatchewan Party does it again, wins fifth-straight provincial election Q: How do the results of the recent election affect things now and going forward as you continue to serve as the Opposition? A: At the start of the election, I think a lot of people wouldn't have necessarily picked us as the odds-on favourite to win, but that was our goal. We believed from the very start that if we worked hard enough and we connected with people in this province and we focused on the things that matter to Saskatchewan people, that we could put ourselves in a position of forming government in this province. Now, of course, we fell short of that goal but we did double the number of seats from the last election, and it is a changed landscape - not just physically in the house, but (it) changed in terms of the dynamic in the house. Q: You've started to incorporate terms like ""shadow cabinet"" and ""shadow minister,"" which had not been utilized previously. Then there's the use of emergency motions through Article 61 to force various votes Is that part of a conscious decision to position your party as being a government in waiting? A: We are committed to using every tool available to us to best serve our role as the official Opposition, including appointing shadow ministers for every one of our new MLAs, using every tool at our disposal in the house and outside of the house to continue to drive home the failures of this government, but also to propose solutions to things that we know Saskatchewan people expect...

Q: How do you balance voting for some of the government's policies - like the Affordability Act, for example - while still maintaining your position as the Opposition? A: There was a change signal that was sent by the people of this province in this election. I think part of the change was the different makeup of the house, but what I heard from a lot of people - and I believe as well - is that people were looking for a change when it comes to how politics happen in our province... We weren't going to vote against relief, but we also weren't going to give up on the fact that Saskatchewan people need relief now and not in 15 months. Q: When it comes to the opening 10-day session, were you able to accomplish the goals that you set out when it started? A: Some of them, yes. In terms of showcasing and really showing the people of this province how strong this brand new team of MLAs is, I think we accomplished that - showing that we were going to pick right up (by) holding this government to account, not backing down when it comes to issues around ethics, around health care, the cost of living.

"Dear Manitobans, you're welcome: Tories:   Interim PC leader claims Kinew's NDP taking credit for what unpopular government did before 2023 election",2024,"As Manitoba’s Progressive Conservatives head into a new year when they’ll choose a new leader, they’re patting themselves on the back for “the many ways in which Manitobans have continued to benefit in 2024 from investments and initiatives launched by the previous PC government.” In a press release Friday, the Tories highlighted measures they initiated before losing to the NDP in October 2023. “The biggest thing was to basically remind Manitobans that (Premier) Wab Kinew is the beneficiary of the previous PC government planting all these trees and they’re now bearing fruit for Manitobans… and he’s taking credit for it,” interim PC leader Wayne Ewasko told the Free Press . The PCs say their government is the one Manitobans can thank for: lower taxes in 2024, expansion of the Selkirk Regional Health Centre, more health-care training seats and rapid access to addictions medicine clinics, the opening of a new school in Morden and work on a new personal-care home in Lac du Bonnet. As well Ewasko took credit for Winnipeg Transit safety officers, infrastructure at the Port of Churchill and the Canadian Premium Sands project; he said the Tories laid the groundwork for it in 2019. “Making sure every Manitoban is benefiting from the basic personal exemption increase — that’s going to put more dollars in absolutely everyone’s pockets,” he said, referring to the tax bracket thresholds increasing Jan. 1, 2024 by 28 per cent to $47,000 and by 26 per cent to $100,000. “Wab Kinew and his government continues to pat himself on the back for the new health-care workers,” he said, referring to the oft-repeated 870 net new hires. “They don’t just pop off from the post-secondary institutions overnight. You had to plant those seeds and the trees don’t grow overnight.” The province has known for 20 years about the looming staffing crisis but did nothing to prepare for it, said Ewasko. “Under our government, we did something about it and now Wab Kinew is able to reap the rewards,” he said. The PCs’ year-end messaging is also meant to counter the common NDP government refrain that any shortcomings in its performance — especially in health care — is the result of underspending and policy mistakes by the Tories, said University of Manitoba political studies professor emeritus Paul Thomas. “After a controversial, divisive campaign leading to a sizable electoral defeat — and still trailing the NDP badly in the polls, the PCs need to achieve some positive publicity, enhance their image in the public mind and improve morale among their supporters,” said Thomas. Claiming credit for the positive benefits of programs and spending after losing the reins of power is “not a regular occurrence,” he said. “In this instance, it is meant to remind Manitobans that not everything about the (former premiers Brian Pallister and Heather Stefanson’s) period was negative,” Thomas said. Both Pallister, the fiscally conservative PC premier who won the 2016 election and Stefanson, who replaced him in 2021 then resigned as leader after the party lost the 2023 election, were deeply unpopular when they left office. The April 26 PC leadership race between Fort Whyte MLA Obby Khan and Churchill business owner Wally Daudrich has attracted little publicity and appears to have generated little excitement among party members, Thomas said. “Clearly, the party would like to generate some momentum going into the new year as the political recovery efforts get seriously underway,” he said. A provincial government cabinet spokesperson dismissed the Tories’ claim to any success in 2024. “The former Stefanson government failed Manitobans on a number of issues, from health care to affordability, leaving behind a $2-billion deficit, a crumbling health-care system and fewer social housing options,” the spokesperson said in a statement Friday. “Their legacy also includes running the most disgusting, divisive campaign in Manitoba’s history.” The party vowed to “stand firm” on Stefanson’s refusal to search a Winnipeg-area landfill for the remains of two Indigenous women who were the victims of a serial killer. Police believe they are buried there. “While (the PCs’) record is full of empty promises, we are the government that is actually implementing the policies and getting the work done for Manitobans by continuing to fix health care and making life more affordable for families,” the cabinet spokesperson said. One organization chided the Tories for describing government spending as “PC investments” and “PC measures.” “These are measures of the duly elected government at that time, paid for by Manitoba taxpayers,” said Molly McCracken, Manitoba director of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. The PCs’ press materials omitted the $1.6 billion in taxes slashed by the Pallister/Stefanson government, bringing Manitoba’s own-source revenue relative to GDP to the lowest level in almost 20 years, McCracken said. The tax cuts left the Manitoba government with the largest deficit in history outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, she said “The loss of this tax revenue makes Manitoba vulnerable to economic shocks or changes in federal equalization payments,” she said. However, McCracken accused the NDP government of doing too little for the people who are struggling the most. carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipe g, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 28, 2024",Leadership; Health care,,2024-12-28,Winnipeg Free Press

"Slow progress for NDP leader:   Without a seat in legislature, Nenshi adjusts to landscape",2024,"Naheed Nenshi is still looking to find his feet - and a seat in the legislature - after six months on the job as leader of Alberta's New Democratic Party. ""I really am still getting my skis under me,"" the former Calgary mayor said of his new gig in a recent year-end interview. Without a seat in the house, he has been watching the cut and thrust of the provincial legislature from the sidelines, and he's trying new things. The Opposition NDP has become more targeted in its media messaging and its approach to debates in the house, in part to avoid the trap of responding to the United Conservative Party government with daily outrage, he said. ""It's almost been useful for me to have the freedom to go talk to the nurses or the teachers or the parents or the cops, rather than be sitting in that room watching really, really bad acting and really terrible drama on the other side of the aisle,"" Nenshi said. Still, the question of where and when the NDP leader might get a seat in that hostile theatre is likely to continue to dog him in 2025. This year was bookended by former premier Rachel Notley announcing in January her resignation as party leader and recently that she would leave the legislature on Monday. In June, Nenshi took the helm. With Notley's Edmonton-Strathcona seat soon to be vacant, Nenshi could look to get elected in the capital, where he now spends much of his time. He said he isn't expecting Premier Danielle Smith to call a byelection before the six-month deadline to do so in June, after the house traditionally breaks for the summer. ""The premier will delay the byelection to keep me out so that I can't be part of the budget debates,"" he said. In more ways than one, the NDP is still under construction. Hanging over Nenshi's head is a steady stream of UCP attack ads accusing the provincial New Democrats of being under the thumb of Jagmeet Singh's federal NDP. Provincial members automatically become part of the federal party, despite clear policy differences between the two, especially when it comes to the oil and gas industry. Nenshi has long said he wants to bring the federal membership issue to his party members to decide as soon as possible. The earliest NDP members could debate, and potentially change that sticking point in the party's constitution, is in early May at the next NDP policy convention in Edmonton. There, members are also expected to steer the direction of what has largely remained a blank slate of a plan and platform. In the new year, Nenshi said the focus will continue to be on what he says has been missing from the UCP's legislative agenda: affordability, jobs, health care, public safety and education. ""These are not priorities for this government at all,"" Nenshi said. He has moved on one front by putting his former health critic, Luanne Metz, in charge of consulting on and fleshing out a health-care plan next year. ""(The UCP is) making this up as they go along and we're going to take the time to get it right,"" Nenshi said. The NDP offered a few priorities in the fall. New Democrats pitched private member's bills that aim to protect workers' tips from being pocketed by employers, bring in cancer care delivery standards and take action on Indigenous reconciliation. A proposal to bring back school class size reporting was defeated. There are UCP policies Nenshi hopes to one day repeal, including what he calls the ""cruel, hateful"" legislation that restricts transgender health care and will bring in pronoun policy in schools. And, after the first full year of the government's loosened ethics rules for political staff to accept gifts, Nenshi has another proposal. ""Throw open the curtains so that we can see all of the grift and corruption that has happened under this government to make sure it's not repeated ever,"" he said.

NDP accused of dropping ball on new health cards,2024,"Applicants for a new Manitoba Health card who expect to receive a modern plastic version featuring the northern lights will be disappointed. The decades-old paper health card will continue to be issued until the provincial government can roll out the long-promised plastic card. A spokesperson for cabinet communications couldn’t explain the reason for the delay. Premier Wab Kinew promised in his state of the province address on Dec. 3 that Manitobans would be able to “order” the new plastic card this month. He said at the time it would replace the printed paper version that hasn’t changed in close to 50 years. “We’re moving Manitoba strongly, decisively into the 1980s,” he quipped at the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce event. The government’s throne speech on Nov. 19 also stated that, “This December, you can apply for a new, plastic health card illuminated by the winning design, (the) northern lights.” In a year-end interview with The Canadian Press, the premier said the rollout has been delayed until mid-January, in part because the Canada Post strike prevented a “pile” of new paper health cards from being sent out. Neither the premier nor government communications staff could say how many paper health cards were held up or explain how the strike had slowed the rollout of the plastic cards. The Canada Post disruption that began Nov. 15 and ended Dec. 17 doesn’t explain the reason for the delay, said Progressive Conservative health critic Kathleen Cook. “A postal strike doesn’t prevent the government from taking applications online or printing plastic health cards to send out once the strike ends,” Cook said in an email. “This delay is yet another broken promise from the NDP on health care,” the member for Roblin said. “Details related to the production of the province’s new plastic health cards are still being finalized,” a government spokesman wrote in an email Tuesday, without elaborating. Once those details and a new online application for the plastic card is in place, Manitobans can apply for it. They won’t be sent automatically to people covered by Manitoba Health. “The new plastic card is optional, so until people apply, Manitoba Health assumes people still want their paper version,” the spokesman said. In addition, it won’t be first-come, first-served, a cabinet communications assistant said. “The new application system will prioritize those who do not currently have a health card to ensure that we get them the coverage they need first,” she said. Requiring Manitobans to apply for the plastic replacement card will help to ensure that the province has the correct, up-to-date name, date of birth and address information, “and especially so they get delivered to the right address,” she said. The government, which has promised to fix health care and is 14 months into its mandate, could’ve scored points by offering Manitobans modern, durable and attractive health cards to replace the worn-out paper ones, said one expert, who added it would have been viewed as a quick fix and emblematic of progress. “It’s a bit of a joke that our cards look the way they do,” University of Winnipeg political science Prof. Malcolm Bird said about the outdated paper health cards. “I think they thought, ‘Oh, this will be an easy win.’ Like many things, it’s more complicated than one would imagine,” he said. The province has said a digital version will be available for Manitobans to save on their smartphones. “What might look like to be a good public relations thing — bringing in new plastic health cards— is not moving as fast as it should be or could be, or ideally would,” said Bird. “That then cast doubt, and cast light on the very serious challenges this government’s facing trying to ‘fix health care’ because that’s complex,” he said. The underlying problem is Manitoba’s $1.3-billion deficit, said Bird. The government spokesman said the cost of switching to modern health cards is not available. “However, it is anticipated that the cost will be less than what was spent to produce the COVID-19 vaccination card ( $1.67 each ),” he said. Cook noted it’s just the latest in a string of delays on government promises. “They pledged more beds at the Grace Hospital by March this year and minor injury clinics at Grace and Misericordia this fall, but failed to meet both deadlines. Manitobans deserve a government that delivers on its commitments,” she said. Bird said the latest snafu is telling. “They’ve had it very easy for the last while, and now things are going to get more difficult.” The Tories are gearing up to elect a new leader in April and “will have more oomph and more direction and more motivation to really challenge this government. Then it’ll become even harder to govern,” the academic said. “Their honeymoon period, as it were, was very long and I think it’s now coming to an end.” carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 27, 2024",Strikes,,2024-12-27,Winnipeg Free Press
Braid: Nenshi's NDP takeover was 2024's most remarkable Alberta political story,2024,"Naheed Nenshi says the UCP made him do it. The former Calgary mayor took the biggest political gamble of any Alberta politician in 2024. Three years after leaving city hall, he decided to run for the leadership of an NDP party he'd never joined or supported. Success was no sure thing when the word came out that he might try to succeed longtime leader Rachel Notley. Seasoned party candidates were lining up. Sarah Hoffman, Kathleen Ganley, Jodi Calahoo Stonehouse and Rakhi Pancholi (who later withdrew) all knew the party and its membership far better than Nenshi did. But he was on to something. There was deep discontent among centrist and leftist voters with the NDP's loss in the 2023 election. The party failed to capture Calgary because of an unnecessary tax policy that seemed anti-business Many Albertans liked the thought of opening up the party beyond its traditional base, largely centred in Edmonton. Nenshi's experienced campaigners from his years as mayor began selling party memberships by the scores of thousands. On judgment day, June 22, Nenshi won 62,000 votes and 86 per cent of the ballots cast That has to stand as the most outstanding Alberta political accomplishment of the year. Naheed Nenshi is introduced as the new leader of the Alberta NDP at the Hyatt Regency in Calgary on Saturday, June 22, 2024. Nenshi was prompted to do it after the weather turned frigid in January. ""A year ago, I was living a very happy retirement,"" he said in a year-end interview. ""I was commenting on things in the news without making the news, having a very successful consulting practice and living a good life. ""In January, when it got very, very cold, we had a challenge with the electrical grid running the risk of system-wide failure that would have plunged people into cold and darkness. ""I realized that not only was this the fault of the UCP government, but their reaction was to try to pin the entire thing on the federal government. That's when I realized we don't have a serious, grown-up government. ""I said the fateful words to myself - somebody's got to do something. I'm the kind of person who, if I shake my fist and say somebody's got to do something, too often that somebody becomes me. ""I realized, like so many Albertans, that this government isn't just bad, they are an existential crisis to the future of Alberta. They are a government with no interest in governing. ""I wouldn't have run if we hadn't thought we'd have a good chance of winning. But I certainly did not expect what happened. We grew the membership of the party by more than 10 times, from 8,000 to 85,000."" Alberta NDP party members listen during a town hall with NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi at the University of Calgary on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2024. Premier Danielle Smith's government, he says, ""are spending our taxpayer money on ads to bolster Pierre Poilievre across the country - for example, the emissions cap ads. ""The Alberta government has become a political action committee for the federal Conservatives."" He predicts that if Poilievre wins the federal election that might come very soon, the UCP will be in trouble. ""I think that if we have a Conservative government federally, the province will be caught with their pants down because they've got nothing else. ""Albertans will start asking themselves if they're better off than they were in 2019 (when the UCP was first elected). ""Is public health care better or worse? Is public safety better or worse? Is our economic outlook better or worse? ""I think at that point, Albertans will say, wow, this is a really terrible government. They haven't done anything but a bunch of performative play-acting in fighting Ottawa."" ""Danielle Smith's only job creation strategy is creating jobs for lawyers in her endless lawsuits with Ottawa."" Naheed Nenshi was photographed during a year-end interview on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024 in Edmonton. Nenshi says that as an unelected leader, he often sits in the legislature visitors' gallery with Grade 6 students. ""You can just see the disappointment on their faces when they see how the UCP in particular act in the legislature."" (Nenshi has told NDP members not to heckle, an order not strictly obeyed.) He's very likely to run in Notley's Edmonton-Strathcona riding when a byelection is held no later than June 2025. And then, we'll start to see if the NDP's great gamble with Naheed Nenshi pays off.

"Nenshi 'will make deals for Alberta'; Party must build on legacy of Notley, NDP leader says in year-end interview",2024,"It has been six months since Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi was elected, becoming the ninth leader of the largest Official Opposition in Alberta's history. Since then, Nenshi has sat in on his first session without a seat, garnering jabs from the UCP. However, he said that in this session, the party focused more on bringing decorum into the house and offering amendments that would fundamentally improve legislation - despite zero out of the 26 proposed amendments being accepted. In a year-end interview with Postmedia, Nenshi said he plans to run for a seat in Calgary or Edmonton when one opens up and reflected on the Alberta NDP's relationships with the UCP and upper levels of government. When asked why he chose not to run in the Lethbridge-West byelection - which has been vacant since July 1 when former NDP MLA Shannon Phillips stepped down - Nenshi said he wasn't there for power. He added he's heard from constituents who resent having an MLA who ""pops in"" a couple of times a year and are unfamiliar with the community. ""I'm here for making sure people have good representation, and given that I don't spend much time in Lethbridge and I don't know the city, I think that the people of Lethbridge deserve an MLA who knows the issues and can advocate for that city,"" Nenshi said. Rachel Notley, former premier and former leader of the Alberta NDP, stepped down as MLA on Dec. 12, leaving a seat open for Edmonton-Strathcona. Nenshi hasn't said whether or not he will be running for the seat, but previously said he's looking to Calgary and Edmonton because he is most familiar with those cities. FAILED AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH THE UCP Nenshi called it an ""interesting"" experience to sit in the gallery during the five weeks of the fall session instead of on the floor. Key amendments he would've liked to see pass regard transgender legislation. One of the amendments would have attempted to bring parental consent back and the second would've prevented students from being outed in schools. ""In January ... I called the premier's office and said, 'There's a flaw here, which is you're going to lead to forcible outing of children,'"" Nenshi said. ""We drafted an amendment, but before we put the amendment on the floor, we offered it to the government. ... They were not interested."" When asked how the NDP will move forward and work with the UCP in the future, he said, ""You don't."" He said the party's work will be outside of the legislature informing Albertans of what key issues are happening and their impact. ""It's much less about the daily cut and thrust of what happens under the dome and much more about what's happening in Albertans'lives every day."" BREAKING WITH FEDERAL NDP STILL ON THE TABLE Nenshi previously said he would explore potentially breaking with the federal NDP party, saying the provincial party needed to broaden its supporter base to all federal parties - not just one. Per the Alberta NDP constitution, a party membership automatically enrols a member in the federal NDP. The UCP has previously characterized the relationship as a Liberal-NDP ""alliance"" tying the Alberta NDP to the Trudeau government. Nenshi said it's become clear to him that the majority of party members want the opt-in to be optional - not automatic. ""Opinions vary on how much further to go than that, but we continue to have conversations with party members,"" he said. ""I'm not a particularly partisan guy, which sounds like a funny thing from a party leader, but I am interested in giving Albertans the best possible solution, and if they find a home in the Alberta NDP, but they have a home in a different party federally, I say we welcome them anyway."" 'DEALS F OR ALBERTA WITH ANY OF THEM' Comments about him being a ""Trudeau sympathizer"" by the governing UCP were waved off by Nenshi, who said whether you like the prime minister or not, at the end of the day, you still have to make a deal with them. ""If I've got a Prime Minister Trudeau or a prime minister Poilievre that I'm dealing with as premier of Alberta, if I'm so lucky, then I will make deals for Alberta with any of them,"" Nenshi said. He pointed to the Trans Mountain pipeline, which was built with the help of Notley and himself, when he was mayor of Calgary. ""I got as much money out of prime minister Harper as I got out of Prime Minister Trudeau when I was mayor of Calgary - the most money of any city in the country, and that's what we'll keep doing."" Going forward, Nenshi said the party has to build on the legacy of leaders like Notley, who he credited for bringing the party into government. ""There's an incredible amount of excitement among Albertans, and hope and optimism about better is possible. That's my theme,"" Nenshi said. ctran@postmedia.com x.com: @kccindytran","Edmonton Journal; Edmonton, Alta.","Edmonton, Alta.","Tran, Cindy",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 26, 2024",Prime ministers,,2024-12-26,Edmonton Journal
Nenshi's takeover of NDP year's most remarkable political move; Former mayor was 'living a good life' in retirement when he took a big gamble,2024,"Naheed Nenshi says the UCP made him do it. The former Calgary mayor took the biggest political gamble of any Alberta politician in 2024. Three years after leaving city hall, he decided to run for the leadership of an NDP he'd never joined or supported. Success was no sure thing when the word came out that he might try to succeed longtime leader Rachel Notley. Seasoned party candidates were lining up. Sarah Hoffman, Kathleen Ganley, Jodi Calahoo Stonehouse and Rakhi Pancholi (who later withdrew) all knew the party and its membership far better than Nenshi did. But he was on to something. There was deep discontent among centrist and leftist voters with the NDP's loss in the 2023 election. The party failed to capture Calgary because of an unnecessary tax policy that seemed anti-business. Many Albertans liked the thought of opening up the party beyond its traditional base, largely centred in Edmonton. Nenshi's experienced campaigners from his years as mayor began selling party memberships by the scores of thousands. On judgment day, June 22, Nenshi won 62,000 votes and 86 per cent of the ballots cast. That has to stand as the most outstanding Alberta political accomplishment of the year. Nenshi was prompted to do it after the weather turned frigid in January. ""A year ago, I was living a very happy retirement,"" he said in a year-end interview. ""I was commenting on things in the news without making the news, having a very successful consulting practice and living a good life. ""In January, when it got very, very cold, we had a challenge with the electrical grid running the risk of system-wide failure that would have plunged people into cold and darkness. I realized that not only was this the fault of the UCP government, but their reaction was to try to pin the entire thing on the federal government. ""That's when I realized we don't have a serious, grown-up government. ""I said the fateful words to myself - somebody's got to do something. I'm the kind of person who, if I shake my fist and say 'somebody's got to do something,' too often that somebody becomes me. ""I realized, like so many Albertans, that this government isn't just bad, they are an existential crisis to the future of Alberta. They are a government with no interest in governing. ""I wouldn't have run if we hadn't thought we'd have a good chance of winning. But I certainly did not expect what happened. We grew the membership of the party by more than 10 times, from 8,000 to 85,000."" Premier Danielle Smith's government, he says, ""are spending our taxpayer money on ads to bolster Pierre Poilievre across the country - for example, the emissions-cap ads. ""The Alberta government has become a political action committee for the federal Conservatives."" He predicts that if Poilievre wins the federal election that might come very soon, the UCP will be in trouble. ""I think that if we have a Conservative government federally, the province will be caught with their pants down because they've got nothing else. ""Albertans will start asking themselves if they're better off than they were in 2019 (when the UCP was first elected). ""Is public health care better or worse? Is public safety better or worse? Is our economic outlook better or worse? ""I think at that point, Albertans will say, wow, this is a really terrible government. They haven't done anything but a bunch of performative play-acting in fighting Ottawa."" ""Danielle Smith's only job creation strategy is creating jobs for lawyers in her endless lawsuits with Ottawa."" Nenshi says that as an unelected leader, he often sits in the legislature visitors' gallery with Grade 6 students. ""You can just see the disappointment on their faces when they see how the UCP in particular act in the legislature."" (Nenshi has told NDP members not to heckle, an order not strictly obeyed.)

Singh called on Monday for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to resign after Chrystia Freeland's bombshell departure from cabinet, but didn't commit to bringing the Liberal government down in a confidence vote. He attempted to defend this noncommittal position in a circuit of year-end interviews this week. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois L eader Yves-François Blanchet both said this week that an election must take place early next year to give a new Parliament time to deal with U.S.president-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20. Poilievre reacted to Singh'sletter by calling it a ""stunt."" ""You did the same stunt in September, claiming you'd no longer prop Trudeau up. Then you went back on your word and voted eight times against an election and for your boss Trudeau,"" Poilievre wrote on X, referring to Singh ending the supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals. Af ter that agreement ended, Singh said his party would vote on confidence matters on a case-by-case basis. The NDP voted against the three confidence motions put forward by the Conservatives this fall. Trudeau has yet to address Freeland's departure publicly but told Liberal MPs this week that he will reflect on the situation and what he was hearing from them. Trudeau shuffled his cabinet on Friday to replace ministers who have left or informed him they won't run again in the next election. NDP House Leader Peter Julian said in a Monday interview that the party would entertain a non-confidence motion at the ""end of February (or) beginning of March"" if Trudeau had not stepped aside by then. The next federal election must be held by October 2025.

"Ex-NDP MLA Selina Robinson's memoir skewers David Eby, is dedicated to John Horgan",2024,"VICTORIA - As ousted NDP cabinet minister Selina Robinson tells it, Premier David Eby was initially supportive of her attempt to apologize for a wrong-headed comment she made after the brutal attack on Israel by Hamas. Robinson referred to Israel as having been established on ""a crappy piece of land with nothing on it."" The comment, during an online forum on Jan. 30, drew accusations of racism and support for genocide. Robinson began working on a public apology and by email, she let the premier know: ""Sorry. I got lazy. ... Should have been more precise in my words. Apology crafted. Should be out soon."" Ten minutes later he responded: ""Happens to the best. Hang in there."" Eby's support didn't last. She soon found herself pressured to resign, then forced out by the premier for offending powerful constituencies inside and outside of the NDP. Robinson's account was published this week as Truth Be Told, a memoir whose profits ""will go to advance coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians and to fight antisemitism in Canada."" The book covers a lot of ground regarding the NDP and antisemitism. The inspiration is a sobering account of what it was like to run afoul of a craven premier and a caucus who were unwilling to stand up to extremist calls for her head. Eby's support for Robinson began unravelling within a day of the e-mail exchange, quoted above. Despite her abject apology, a dozen Imams, mosques and Islamic centres told the premier that unless she was fired, NDP MLAs and candidates would not be permitted in their facilities. ""This was no small threat,"" writes Robinson. ""Candidates depend on these connections, especially in many culturally diverse areas, like Surrey, where close elections can be won or lost."" She then asks a question that underscores a double standard in the NDP. ""What would the Premier's response have been had the issue been, say, reproductive freedom or LGBTQ+ rights and the clergy were Catholic bishops?"" The backlash also forced the NDP to cancel a fundraiser in Surrey, a key battleground in this year's provincial election. The premier then summoned Robinson to a meeting of the caucus of NDP MLAs and cabinet ministers on Monday Feb. 5. He directed her to attend long enough to deliver an apology for the damage she'd done, then leave to allow the caucus ""to have a conversation about my actions without me in the room."" It was a sign that Eby no longer had her back. ""I would never know what happened or what was said,"" writes Robinson. ""It was a show trial in which the outcome was never in doubt."" She recited at caucus an apology crafted in the premier's office, then went home to await a call from the premier, which came shortly after noon. ""He told me that he could not see a way forward. I asked him what that meant. He repeated the phrase. I told the premier that if he wanted my resignation, I would give it to him, but he needed to ask for it."" Apparently Eby couldn't bring himself to say ""you're fired."" Instead, Robinson was handed off to the premier's office to work on a statement announcing her exit. In the midst of that work, the soon-to-be-ex minister got a call from Lisa Beare, then as now a member of Eby's cabinet. Robinson had regarded her as friend, but was soon disabused of that notion. ""Lisa called to say that I really should resign. She explained that there were no other options, and it would be best for everyone if I did the right thing. ""The right thing?"" fumes Robinson. ""I was the one besieged by a mob and they wanted me to do the right thing. Amid the worst moments of my life, Lisa's phone call stands out as one of the most painful memories."" The premier's office and Robinson finally compromised a news release that framed her departure as a ""joint decision."" Those weasel words notwithstanding, Eby's subsequent statement left no doubt that he'd forced her out: ""The depth of the work that Minister Robinson needs to do to address the harms that she's caused is significant and it is incompatible with her continuing as a minister."" Robinson, who was still an NDP MLA, offered to reach out to the Muslim and Jewish communities along the lines that the premier suggested. But Eby's chief of staff, Matt Smith, squelched the project as ""too political."" Robinson had one last meeting with Eby, hoping against hope that he'd changed his mind about her proposed outreach. Instead, he sought her help in derailing a plan by her constituency executive to write a letter of protest over her rough treatment. With that last, discouraging signal from the boss, Robinson resigned from the NDP caucus to sit as an independent. ""I did not leave my premier and my party, they left me."" During her seven years in government, Robinson served two premiers: John Horgan and David Eby. Her book is a persuasive indictment of Eby's limitations as a leader. The contents are dedicated to Horgan. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related B.C.'s public service 'freeze' comes after NDP added 1,600 jobs in six months There's no sign of the NDP reining in spending.

Singh vows to bring down government,2024,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has announced he will declare a loss of confidence in the Liberal government next year, a move that would trigger an early election should other opposition parties support his move. Singh's Friday pronouncement, which came in the form of an open letter posted on social media, was met with derision from Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives, who said the NDP leader must have had an ""epiphany"" after his previous refusals to join the Official Opposition in toppling Justin Trudeau's minority government. Singh wrote the Liberals were undeserving of ""another chance."" ""That's why the NDP will vote to bring this government down and give Canadians a chance to vote for a government who will work for them,"" he wrote. He said the New Democrats plan to use their next opposition day in the House of Commons - during which opposition priorities are given precedence over government business - to introduce the vote. The House is currently on its winter break and is set to resume Jan. 27. The schedule that outlines when opposition business dominates the parliamentary agenda has not yet been set, meaning it could be many weeks into the new year before opposition days are held. It also means other parties could introduce non-confidence motions before the NDP gets the opportunity to do so.","Toronto Star; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,"Torstar Syndication Services, a Division of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited","Dec 21, 2024",Opposition parties; Prime ministers,,2024-12-21,Toronto Star
Singh's move helps Trudeau and Freeland,2024,"The walls that were caving in around Justin Trudeau earlier this week came crashing down Friday. The prime minister remains alive, in hiding, but with every player in Ottawa circulating overhead trying to out-strategize each other, his days in office are now dramatically reduced. The day began with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh throwing a grenade into Trudeau's cabinet shuffle. Twelve days after declaring confidence in the prime minister, Singh announced on social media that he had now decided the Liberals - not just the prime minister but any possible Liberal leader - could not remain in office. ""The NDP will vote to bring this government down, and give Canadians a chance to vote for a government who will work for them,"" he posted on X. If Singh intends to follow through, and that is a big ""if"" - he announced in September that he was pulling out of the supply and confidence agreement because the Grits were ""too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interest to fight for people,"" only to continue keeping Trudeau's government afloat - it was a tactical move. First, if means that Singh could, if given the chance - also a big ""if"" - defeat the government before he qualifies for his MP's pension in late February. That rumour spread by the Conservatives that he has been stalling because of his pension eligibility has spread like wildfire. Instead of appearing like a party focused on working people, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is stressing that the New Democrats - and Singh specifically - are just in it for themselves, sacrificing the public's chance at a brighter future for Singh's desire to pad his pockets. If Singh gets the chance to defeat the government before Feb. 25, it could help put that line of attack to bed. But the arrival of Singh's announcement just before Trudeau's cabinet shuffle is more consequential than that. It means the calculations many Liberals made, that the NDP would sit idly by while the Liberals held a leadership contest, can no longer be relied upon. It means if the Grits are to have a leadership race - the party's constitution says it must last at least three months and would probably need a few more days for planning - it likely needs to be shorter than 90 days, and puts immense pressure on the prime minister to prorogue Parliament. Running a leadership race with an unpopular minority in Parliament would be near impossible. But asking Gov. Gen. Mary Simon for a prorogation is not a sure bet. Former governor general Michaëlle Jean granted prime minister Stephen Harper a reprieve from a near-certain defeat in the House after opposition MPs banded together in the fall of 2008, but the prorogation crossed over the Christmas break and few sitting days were affected by the formal timeout. Waterloo University political scientist Emmett Macfarlane told the Star he believes the Governor General would likely agree to prorogue Parliament to allow the Liberals to select a new leader, but suggested the break would need to be short - a return of Parliament no later than the end of March. But prorogation carries big political risks. It would feed the impression that the Liberals are self-serving, suspending Parliament to find a new leader who has better chances of defeating Poilievre, while ignoring the legislative needs of the nation. For the cast of dissenting Liberal MPs, which appears to grow by the hour and met Thursday night to plan its next coup attempt, Singh's move Friday made it both easier for Trudeau to remain Liberal leader into the next election, and for the Grits to pick an interim leader already in their midst - say Chrystia Freeland or Dominic LeBlanc - by arguing there is no time for a fully realized contest. It's easy to see how that benefits Singh, and harder to see how the Liberal party benefits. Leadership contests, as witnessed by Poilievre's own race, are a great opportunity to raise money, to build the candidates' profiles, expand the party base and gather crucial information about potential voters. But if Singh intended to speed up the timeline of the next election by a few months, Poilievre sought to convince them it should be now. Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill, Poilievre said he was writing to the Governor General to ask her to urgently return MPs to Ottawa so they could vote non-confidence in the prime minister. Between the Conservative, Bloc Québécois and NDP MPs, along with 18 Liberals, 70 per cent of MPs had expressed lost confidence in the prime minister, Poilievre noted. ""In the middle of a trade, border, crime and cost of living emergency, this cannot go on,"" he said. Poilievre's move placed pressure on Singh to endorse a swift return to the Commons, but also pressures the Grits into sticking with the leader they have, or dump him for a colleague they know. It means less chance of former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney or former B.C. premier Christy Clark joining the race. And that may be where the Liberals go. In a letter to the prime minister, Ottawa-area MP Chandra Arya called on Trudeau to resign and for caucus to rally behind Freeland. He wasn't the first MP to endorse her this week, and he won't be the last.

"NDP say they will vote non-confidence as Liberals shuffle federal cabinet:   Prime Minister appoints eight new ministers, with a dozen overall changes to front bench",2024,"New Democrats pulled their support for the minority Liberal government on Friday, throwing the beleaguered Prime Minister’s tenure into further doubt just minutes before Justin Trudeau shuffled his cabinet. As Liberal MPs walked into Rideau Hall to be sworn in as part of Mr. Trudeau’s front bench, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh released a letter on social media in which he committed to vote non-confidence in the government after the House returns on Jan. 27. The announcement is a marked change from the position his party took this fall when it repeatedly gave confidence in the government and the one he staked out earlier this week, where he said the NDP would leave all options on the table when deciding whether to still support the minority Liberals after deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland quit cabinet. “The NDP will vote to bring this government down, and give Canadians a chance to vote for a government who will work for them. No matter who is leading the Liberal Party, this government’s time is up,” said Mr. Singh in the Friday letter. His letter was silent on how the NDP would vote on non-confidence motions from other parties. Mr. Singh’s office said the NDP will table a non-confidence motion during the party’s first and only opposition day in the next parliamentary sitting. The government gets to decide when to schedule opposition days and has not yet assigned them for the winter term. While the timing is uncertain, the NDP’s announcement leaves the Liberals without any reliable allies in the House of Commons to ensure they can survive confidence votes and get their agenda through Parliament. Despite that, the cabinet shuffle proceeded only a few minutes late on Friday morning, and was presided over by Mr. Trudeau. Late in the day, the Prime Minister spoke briefly to reporters for the first time since Ms. Freeland’s Monday resignation. But he declined to answer questions about his political future and instead said his new cabinet was focused on dealing with the incoming administration of Donald Trump. “We have a lot of work to do and that’s what we’re focused on,” he said, citing the need to protect the economy and jobs in the “Canada-U.S. dynamic.” On Friday, three more Liberal MPs added their names to those who have publicly called for the Prime Minister to resign. The tally was at just a few before Ms. Freeland’s resignation and scathing attack on his leadership, but it now sits at 21 – about 18 per cent of Mr. Trudeau’s back bench. Toronto MP Rob Oliphant posted a letter on social media Friday morning urging the Prime Minister to “relinquish the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada” and called for a robust leadership race. The Globe and Mail reported on Thursday that Mr. Trudeau was in discussions with close advisers about whether he should stay as leader, but it remained unclear where the conversations would land with the expectation set that he would only make a decision in the new year. After the swearing-in ceremony, new Housing and Infrastructure Minister Nate Erskine-Smith, a Toronto MP, acknowledged to reporters that he’s going to have a “short runway” to make a difference in his new file. While Montreal MP Rachel Bendayan, who was promoted to Official Languages Minister, told reporters that the Prime Minister is still reflecting on his future. Other ministers insisted on a positive message, with Steve MacKinnon, who on Friday became Employment Minister in addition to his role at Labour, telling reporters that the cabinet is “full of new energy.” “We are a united front,” newly promoted Treasury Board President Ginette Petitpas Taylor offered to reporters. The Prime Minister’s Office had been planning the cabinet shuffle for months, but what was initially supposed to be a revamped team to take on Mr. Trump turned into one focused on filling the holes in the wake of Ms. Freeland’s exit and former central banker Mark Carney’s refusal to join the fray. On Monday, Mr. Trudeau’s long-time friend, Dominic LeBlanc, was promoted to Finance. His role at Public Safety was taken over by Ottawa MP David McGuinty. The new minister maintained in a scrum with reporters that the government still has time to negotiate with an opposition party before the House returns at the end of January. “Between now and Jan. 27 much could happen,” Mr. McGuinty said. In total, eight MPs were promoted into cabinet and four ministers had their portfolios changed. Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet is made up of 39 ministers, including himself. Quebec MP Élisabeth Brière is now Minister of National Revenue; Nova Scotia MP Darren Fisher is Veterans Minister; Newfoundland and Labrador’s Joanne Thompson took over as Seniors Minister; Liberal campaign cochair and Manitoba MP Terry Duguid is now Minister of Sport and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada; and government whip and Ontario MP Ruby Sahota is now the Minister of Democratic Institutions and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. Mr. Trudeau also reassigned four of his existing ministers, some of whom were juggling multiple roles. He left Anita Anand as Minister of Transport, while adding the internal trade portfolio to her responsibilities, and handed her second role as Treasury Board president to Ms. Taylor. Gary Anandasangaree will remain Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and add Northern Affairs and the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency to his files. Missing from the regional mix is a cabinet minister from Alberta. A federal election is scheduled for next October, but the NDP’s decision to pull confidence means an election is now expected much sooner. In the wake of Ms. Freeland’s Monday resignation, both Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader YvesFrançois Blanchet called on Mr. Trudeau to call a general election. On Friday, Mr. Poilievre wrote a letter to Governor-General Mary Simon to request that the House urgently be recalled so the opposition parties can move non-confidence in the Trudeau government. “Mr. Trudeau has lost confidence in Parliament,” he said. “This means Mr. Trudeau can no longer govern.” The Conservative Leader mocked the New Democrats for now promising to move non-confidence in the government after Parliament adjourned for the Christmas break and after giving the Liberals confidence less than two weeks ago. He noted that had the NDP voted non-confidence when they had the chance, the country would already be well into an election campaign. Mr. Poilievre urged the leaders of the NDP and Bloc to join in his request to the Governor-General. However, it’s unlikely that his request will be granted given recent precedent. Most recently in 2008, all opposition leaders had declared an intention to defeat then-Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper’s government. In response, Mr. Harper requested that the governor-general prorogue Parliament and she granted the request.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Walsh, Marieke; Levitz, Stephanie; Fife, Robert",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 21, 2024",Resignations; Political campaigns; Economic development; Parliaments; Prime ministers; Social networks; Political leadership; No confidence motions & votes; Political parties; Federal elections-Canada; Shakeups,Nom: Liberal Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940; Nom: New Democratic Party-Canada; NAICS: 813940,2024-12-21,The Globe and Mail
Jagmeet Singh promises non-confidence motion when Parliament returns,2024,"OTTAWA - NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Friday morning that his caucus will vote to bring the Liberal government down when Parliament reconvenes in the new year.

"B.C.'s public service 'freeze' comes after NDP added 1,600 jobs in six months",2024,"VICTORIA - Premier David Eby announced a public sector ""hiring freeze"" last week in response to concerns that the government has been adding jobs at three times the rate of the private sector. ""There is currently a hiring freeze among the public sector,"" Eby assured the B.C. Chamber of Commerce during a speech in which he pledged to ""reset"" the NDP relationship with the business community. The freeze would not apply to ""front-line services like health care and education"" but only ""among the administration of the public service,"" the premier hastened to clarify. Finance Minister Brenda Bailey echoed the message in releasing this week's update on provincial finances. ""This hiring freeze is really about us being smart with our internal resources, and as we work on the path to fiscal sustainability, the path to balance,"" she told reporters in Victoria. Bailey provided no details about any plan to restore balance and sustainability to provincial finances. The fine print of her budget update did provide a telling perspective on the reputed hiring freeze. In the first half of the current financial year, the New Democrats have already added the equivalent of 1,600 full-time jobs in central government, which is a four per cent increase in employment in just six months. A serious-minded freeze might have commenced with a vow to phase out all the positions added this year. But that is not the NDP way. This NDP government has already increased the number of full-time positions in central administration by 33 per cent during its seven years in office. Many of those are administrative, including non-union or excluded positions. I doubt that will be the end of it, judging from an overview the government released after the premier's announcement last week. For starters, Eby's hiring freeze is not, in fact a freeze, it is ""a temporary pause in external hiring."" ""This is not a hiring freeze,"" says the key passage in the document dated Dec. 12. ""But rather a proactive measure to make sure the B.C. public service is making the best use of its resources in a constrained fiscal situation."" There follow a number of exemptions and exceptions, large and small. One: ""The temporary external hiring pause applies to core B.C. public service positions. It does not apply to Crown corporations or other public sector organizations."" Along with Eby's announced exclusion of schools, hospitals and other front-line service providers, the exemption for Crown corporations and agencies has the effect of excluding almost 90 per cent of all positions in the broad public sector. Two: ""Competitions where an offer has been made on or before Dec. 11, 2024 will proceed to completion."" Where eligible candidates have been identified, ""they are to be offered a position in accordance with their placement on the list."" Three: Despite the temporary pause, the government will continue to recruit and hire outside candidates ""to fill critical and front-line positions or to meet an urgent government priority."" Which is to say, an urgent NDP priority. I'm guessing that will allow the New Democrats to staff up the new Ministry of Infrastructure, charged with consolidating capital planning and procurement for schools, post-secondary institutions, health care facilities, court houses and correctional facilities. Four: ""The B.C. public service remains committed to reconciliation, equity, diversity and inclusion, and we recognize many of our internship programs support diversity. These programs remain unchanged and are an exception for hiring external candidates. Ministries are encouraged to continue their support for these programs."" Five: Deputy ministers in each ministry have leeway to decide if a position meets ""the criteria of critical and front-line or urgent government priority, for external posting. ""Primary consideration should be given to positions outside of Victoria and Vancouver and those that support increasing diversity and being more representative of the communities we serve."" In short, the pause has many loopholes and there are plenty of ways to get around the restrictions on hiring. It recalls a stunt the New Democrats pulled back in the 1990s, when then Premier Glen Clark was trying to make himself look tough in his dealings with the public sector unions. Clark announced the elimination of 1,500 government positions and later expanded the target to include thousands more jobs. He reaped a lot of favourable news coverage, drew convenient protests from the union representing government employees, and the apparent showdown helped him win the 1996 provincial election. Later, union head John Shields disclosed how many unionized workers were actually laid off in Clark's staged winnowing of the public sector. Only 14. Something to keep in mind during the unfolding of Eby's open ended ""pause"" in public sector hiring. ""While there is no defined end date, this is considered an interim measure,"" according to the Eby government overview. ""The head of the public service (Shannon Salter) is committed to continued open communication about the hiring pause."" By no coincidence the premier announced the pause at the outset of a year of contract bargaining with the public sector unions. The unions doubtless saw through the government's bogus freeze in a flash. But neither should the public be fooled. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related There's no sign of the NDP reining in spending.

Naheed Nenshi reflects on past six months as Alberta NDP leader in year-end interview,2024,"It has been six months since Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi was elected. Since then, he has sat in on his first session at the Alberta legislature without a seat garnering jabs from the UCP. However, he said that in this session, the party focused more on bringing decorum into the house and offering amendments that would fundamentally improve legislation - despite zero out of the 26 proposed amendments being accepted. In a year-end interview with Postmedia, Nenshi said he plans to run for a seat in Calgary or Edmonton when one opens up and reflected on the Alberta NDP's relationships with the UCP and upper levels of government. When asked why he chose not to run in the Lethbridge-West byelection - which has been vacant since July 1 when former NDP MLA Shannon Phillips stepped down - Nenshi said he wasn't there for power. He added he's heard from constituents who resent having an MLA who ""pops in"" a couple of times a year and are unfamiliar with the community. ""I'm here for making sure people have good representation, and given that I don't spend much time in Lethbridge and I don't know the city, I think that the people of Lethbridge deserve an MLA who knows the issues and can advocate for that city,"" Nenshi said. Rachel Notley, former premier and former leader of the Alberta NDP, stepped down as MLA on Dec. 12, leaving a seat open for Edmonton-Strathcona. Nenshi hasn't said whether or not he will be running for the seat but previously said he's looking to Calgary and Edmonton because he is most familiar with those cities. Failed amendments and working with the UCP Nenshi called it an ""interesting"" experience to sit in the gallery during the five weeks of the fall session instead of on the floor. Key amendments he would've liked to see pass were those regarding transgender legislation. One of the amendments would have attempted to bring parental consent back and the second would've prevented students from being outed in schools. ""In January... I called the premier's office and said, 'There's a flaw here, which is you're going to lead to forcible outing of children,'"" Nenshi said. ""We drafted an amendment, but before we put the amendment on the floor, we offered it to the government... They were not interested."" When asked how the NDP will move forward and work with the UCP in the future, he said, ""You don't."" He said the party's work will be outside of the legislature informing Albertans of what key issues are happening and their impact. ""It's much less about the daily cut and thrust of what happens under the dome and much more about what's happening in Albertans' lives every day,"" Nenshi said. Naheed Nenshi speaks in an interview on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024, in Edmonton. Separating from federal NDP still on the table Nenshi previously said he would explore potentially breaking with the federal NDP party, saying the provincial party needed to broaden its supporter base to all federal parties - not just one. Per the Alberta NDP constitution, a party membership automatically enrols a member in the federal NDP. The UCP has previously characterized the relationship as a Liberal-NDP ""alliance"" tying the Alberta NDP to the Trudeau government. Nenshi said it's become clear to him that the majority of party members want the opt-in to be optional - not automatic. ""Opinions vary on how much further to go than that, but we continue to have conversations with party members,"" he said. ""I'm not a particularly partisan guy, which sounds like a funny thing from a party leader, but I am interested in giving Albertans the best possible solution, and if they find a home in the Alberta NDP, but they have a home in a different party federally, I say we welcome them anyway."" 'I will make deals for Alberta with any of them' Comments about him being a ""Trudeau sympathizer"" by the governing UCP were waved off by Nenshi, who said whether you like the prime minister or not, at the end of the day, you still have to make a deal with them. ""If I've got a Prime Minister Trudeau or a prime minister Poilievre that I'm dealing with as premier of Alberta, if I'm so lucky, then I will make deals for Alberta with any of them,"" Nenshi said. He pointed to the Trans Mountain pipeline, which was built with the help of Notley and himself, who was the mayor of Calgary at the time. ""I got as much money out of prime minister Harper as I got out of Prime Minister Trudeau when I was mayor of Calgary - the most money of any city in the country, and that's what we'll keep doing."" Going forward, Nenshi said the party has to build on the legacy of leaders like Notley, who he credited for bringing the party into government.

NDP keeps Lethbridge riding in byelection,2024,"The New Democratic Party's Rob Miyashiro won the byelection in Lethbridge-West on Wednesday, retaining the Opposition party's only seat south of Calgary. Miyashiro received 7,239 votes with all 57 polls reporting, according to unofficial results posted late Wednesday on the Elections Alberta website. That tally was 1,150 more than the United Conservative Party's John Middleton-Hope, who got 6,089 votes. Alberta Party candidate Layton Veverka received 233 votes. The NDP has represented the Lethbridge riding in the Alberta legislature since 2015 when Shannon Phillips was first elected MLA and the party swept into power, but the riding has been without an MLA since Phillips stepped aside July 1. During a brief victory speech, Miyashiro, sporting an orange suit, thanked his campaign team and supporters, and praised Middleton-Hope - a Lethbridge city councillor and former Lethbridge police chief - for running a strong campaign. ""I've heard from parents worried about overcrowded classrooms, from seniors struggling to afford their medications and from so many of you that just want a government that puts people first,"" the former Lethbridge city councillor said Wednesday night at The Zoo, a pub on the University of Lethbridge campus. During an interview Thursday, Miyashiro said it's been decades since the NDP won a provincial byelection. ""It's not a bad Christmas present, not bad at all,"" he said. Lethbridge-West residents'biggest concern is health care, said Miyashiro, who's stepping down from his role as executive director of the Lethbridge Senior Citizens Organization. Two family doctors announced during the campaign they are leaving the province, and ""tens of thousands"" of Lethbridge residents are without a family physician, he said. In a Thursday statement, Middleton-Hope said he's ""incredibly grateful"" for the support he and the UCP received during the campaign. ""While the result wasn't what we hoped for, we made significant strides and closed the gap considerably,"" he said. The voter turnout of roughly 37 per cent sets a record for an Alberta byelection. More residents voted during the advance poll, which took place over five days last week, than on election day. Of the 13,561 valid votes, 49 per cent were cast during the advance poll while 5,539 residents - representing almost 41 per cent of the total votes - got out to vote on Wednesday.

High-stakes byelection reinforces Nenshi's leadership of the NDP; Ex-Calgary mayor has chance to win a seat when Notley leaves Edmonton-Strathcona,2024,"It was just a mid-term byelection, barely noticed by media and the general public, but hugely important for Alberta politics. NDP candidate Rob Miyashiro won Lethbridge-West Wednesday by 1,150 votes, a wider margin than most observers expected. The even bigger winner was party Leader Naheed Nenshi. This vote was the first real test of his leadership since he took over the party in June, after longtime leader Rachel Notley stepped down. If the party had lost, grumbling in some corners of the NDP caucus would have escalated. These traditional NDP people don't care for Nenshi's more centrist approach. They're suspicious of his efforts to detach the party from Jagmeet Singh's federal NDP. They feel uneasy about his communications strategy that focuses more on the leader and less on daily tire-biting over every move Premier Danielle Smith makes. They remain nostalgic about Notley and would have resented anyone who followed, except perhaps loyalist Sarah Hoffman. Winning 62,000 leadership votes, mostly from new NDP members, was a great achievement for Nenshi. But for some New Democrats this was almost too much success. It raised questions about the nature of the party. Was it still the NDP at all? All that was in play on Wednesday. A loss in a riding won three times by Shannon Phillips, after a campaign that heavily featured Nenshi, threatened serious damage to his leadership and the party's momentum. The UCP types were drooling Wednesday night over a looming defeat for ""the purple"" - Nenshi's trademark colour when he was Calgary mayor. The count was very close until late results from two advance polls swamped UCP candidate John Middleton-Hope. Nenshi had to be at least as happy as Miyashiro. Nothing secures a leader's position like election victory. It's obvious that if it can happen in Lethbridge, the ex-mayor remains a threat to the UCP in Calgary. There's also a powerful message here for Smith and her party. They threw the book at Lethbridge-West and still couldn't win it. They mounted a provincewide campaign to discredit Nenshi with ads connecting him to Singh and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ever since he won the leadership, they've been trying to fix a sellout image of him in the public's mind. Many conservatives love that pitch, but it sure didn't work on the ground in Lethbridge-West. The only point of spending small fortunes on ads like that is to win. Nenshi can now concentrate on winning a riding for himself.

"Eby's public sector hiring 'freeze'has many loopholes; NDP already added 1,600 jobs during the first six months of financial year",2024,"Premier David Eby announced a public sector ""hiring freeze"" last week in response to concerns that the government has been adding jobs at three times the rate of the private sector. ""There is currently a hiring freeze among the public sector,"" Eby assured the B.C. Chamber of Commerce during a speech in which he pledged to ""reset"" the NDP relationship with the business community. The freeze would not apply to ""front-line services like health care and education"" but only ""among the administration of the public service,"" the premier hastened to clarify. Finance Minister Brenda Bailey echoed the message in releasing this week's update on provincial finances. ""This hiring freeze is really about us being smart with our internal resources, and as we work on the path to fiscal sustainability, the path to balance,"" she told reporters in Victoria. Bailey provided no details about any plan to restore balance and sustainability to provincial finances. The fine print of her budget update did provide a telling perspective on the reputed hiring freeze. In the first half of the current financial year, the New Democrats have already added the equivalent of 1,600 full-time jobs in central government, which is a four per cent increase in employment in just six months. A serious-minded freeze might have commenced with a vow to phase out all the positions added this year. But that is not the NDP way. This NDP government has already increased the number of full-time positions in central administration by 33 per cent during its seven years in office. Many of those are administrative, including non-union or excluded positions. I doubt that will be the end of it, judging from an overview the government released after the premier's announcement last week. For starters, Eby's hiring freeze is not, in fact a freeze, it is ""a temporary pause in external hiring."" ""This is not a hiring freeze,"" says the key passage in the document dated Dec. 12. ""But rather a proactive measure to make sure the B.C. public service is making the best use of its resources in a constrained fiscal situation."" There follow a number of exemptions and exceptions, large and small. One: ""The temporary external hiring pause applies to core B.C. public service positions. It does not apply to Crown corporations or other public sector organizations."" Along with Eby's announced exclusion of schools, hospitals and other front-line service providers, the exemption for Crown corporations and agencies has the effect of excluding almost 90 per cent of all positions in the broad public sector. Two: ""Competitions where an offer has been made on or before Dec. 11, 2024 will proceed to completion."" Where eligible candidates have been identified, ""they are to be offered a position in accordance with their placement on the list."" Three: Despite the temporary pause, the government will continue to recruit and hire outside candidates ""to fill critical and front-line positions or to meet an urgent government priority."" Which is to say, an urgent NDP priority. I'm guessing that will allow the New Democrats to staff up the new Ministry of Infrastructure, charged with consolidating capital planning and procurement for schools, post-secondary institutions, health-care facilities, court houses and correctional facilities. Four: ""The B.C. public service remains committed to reconciliation, equity, diversity and inclusion, and we recognize many of our internship programs support diversity. These programs remain unchanged and are an exception for hiring external candidates. Ministries are encouraged to continue their support for these programs."" Five: Deputy ministers in each ministry have leeway to decide if a position meets ""the criteria of critical and front-line or urgent government priority, for external posting. ""Primary consideration should be given to positions outside of Victoria and Vancouver and those that support increasing diversity and being more representative of the communities we serve."" In short, the pause has many loopholes and there are plenty of ways to get around the restrictions on hiring. It recalls a stunt the New Democrats pulled back in the 1990s, when then-premier Glen Clark was trying to make himself look tough in his dealings with the public sector unions. Clark announced the elimination of 1,500 government positions and later expanded the target to include thousands more jobs. He reaped a lot of favourable news coverage, drew convenient protests from the union representing government employees, and the apparent showdown helped him win the 1996 provincial election. Later, union head John Shields disclosed how many unionized workers were actually laid off in Clark's staged winnowing of the public sector. Only 14. Something to keep in mind during the unfolding of Eby's open-ended ""pause"" in public sector hiring. ""While there is no defined end date, this is considered an interim measure,"" according to the Eby government overview. ""The head of the public service (Shannon Salter) is committed to continued open communication about the hiring pause."" By no coincidence the premier announced the pause at the outset of a year of contract bargaining with the public sector unions. The unions doubtless saw through the government's bogus freeze in a flash. But neither should the public be fooled. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 20, 2024",Hiring; Multiculturalism & pluralism; Public sector,,2024-12-20,The Vancouver Sun
"CBC veers toward journalism, misses; Jagmeet singh has made a specialty of failing upwards. - adam pankratz",2024,"T his week, senior CBC parliamentary bureau reporter Janyce Mc-Gregor, no doubt, came to work with the full intention of delivering journalism to Canadians. Her journalism, as her X bio points out, is in ""heavy rotation on the CBC."" Somewhere along the way, for some reason, she veered off the path and missed the mark, committing herself to a fantastical narrative about Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. The broadcast in question (which does not appear to be posted anywhere on CBC's site yet) took place on Tuesday and features an attack on Poilievre on several fronts including his predictions about former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, his commentary on Justin Trudeau's treatment of female cabinet ministers, and the newness of the Conservative leader's commentary on the plunging dollar. It sure seems like Poilievre can't do anything right in McGregor's eyes. During the broadcast, McGregor suggests that in his Tuesday news conference, Poilievre went ""on and on"" about how now former finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned the previous day from cabinet just hours before she was to deliver the fall economic statement. In her resignation letter, Freeland revealed that Trudeau had fired her from the finance portfolio, and wanted to shift to her to a much less prestigious position. Poilievre deduced, ""They (Trudeau and Carney) had a deal ... that he (Carney) would take Chrystia Freeland's job. Well, when Carney saw how bad it all looked, he said, I no longer want the job."" The CBC's McGregor rebuked this analysis. ""I think some of the ways that (Poilievre) explained this might be veering towards fiction and quite speculative on his part,"" McGregor said, trying to suggest Poilievre was drawing conclusions based on nothing, implying what he was saying was unfounded. In reference to Poilievre's comments about a ""deal being made with Mark Carney and Mark Carney no longer wanting the job (of finance minister),"" McGregor scoffed at the notion that it could be true. ""That is not something that lines up with reporting done by professional journalists to date,"" she said, presumably very proud of herself. ""But listening to (Poilievre), I think he is veering beyond what are established facts in this situation."" But anyone reading ""professional journalism"" leading up to Poilievre's news conference could have followed the breadcrumbs and would have come to the same conclusion about who Trudeau wanted to replace Freeland with. Case in point, The Globe and Mail published a story with the headline: ""Trudeau makes fresh bid to recruit Mark Carney amid tensions with Freeland"" on Dec. 12 - five whole days before McGregor's analysis. And just on Wednesday, it was confirmed that Trudeau did indeed want Carney in the finance minister job, but it was also confirmed that the former bank governor would not be joining the government, just as Poilievre had speculated. Though we don't yet know Carney's reasoning. In her critique, McGregor then skips to how Poilievre was ""very much working to try to put a gender narrative on what happened."" The CBC reporter seems to reject that Freeland's firing had anything to do with how the prime minister treats women, because Freeland didn't put it in her resignation letter. I can't help but wonder whether McGregor would be so dismissive of a gender narrative if this action was being taken by a Conservative leader with a long history of throwing female ministers under the bus when they give him trouble. In her final critique of Poilievre's news conference, McGregor called it ""somewhat new for him to note the plunging dollar in his economic analysis."" Well, that's because the morning of Poilievre's news conference, the Canadian dollar dipped below (USD) 70 cents for the first time since early 2020, suggesting the Opposition leader brought it up because he read the ""established facts"" reported by ""professional journalists."" McGregorthenat -tempts to paint the plunging dollar as a good thing for Canadians. It must be, if Poilievre doesn't like it, right? This broadcast is yet another instance of CBC veering towards journalism and missing - not the best look for an institution whose whole raison d'être is currently being called into question. The importance of CBC is looking more and more like fiction.

Singh can't see past his maserati parking spot,2024,"The shallowest man in Canada had quite the day on Monday when Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland launched her volley of Molotov cocktails on the way out the door. Years of hypocrisy, pandering, and spinelessness laid bare for all the world to see as now former minister Freeland apparently decided she had had quite enough of bilking Canadians and subjecting them to ludicrous policies for the sole purpose of political expediency. What will this poor man do now? I refer, of course, to Jagmeet Singh. Jagmeet Singh has made a specialty of failing upwards. Since his election to the head of the NDP, he has been hailed as a new type of leader which would pull the Dippers forward and towards power. He has, however, never done anything of the sort, despite the Liberals doing their best to hand him votes. Let's all cast our minds back to the 2019 election when, following Justin Trudeau's apparent overenthusiasm for dress-up parties and makeup, we were assured that the NDP would make large gains in marginal ridings around the country. Nothing ever materialized, even in British Columbia where, at the time, the Trans Mountain pipeline was a hot-button issue the NDP were salivating over. Singh's own riding of Burnaby South covers half of the city in which the TMX pipeline terminates, yet he could do nothing to carry the message. This is, of course, partly because Singh never actually spends any time in Burnaby, but has the added feature of also being nationally embarrassing. The story was largely the same in 2021, when Canadians returned an essentially unchanged parliament following Trudeau's COVID-19 election. The NDP still languished a distant third, unable to convince Canada they had anything to offer. Now, with the Liberals in free fall, polls all have the NDP stagnant while Canadians, especially younger ones, flock to the Conservatives. It's a stunning indictment of NDP appeal under Singh. In all of this, the only time the NDP seat count changed significantly was when it went from 44 to 24 seats in 2019. Yet, fate decided that the Liberals would need NDP support to keep their government going, and so the country has been subjected to five years of Jagmeet Singh's caterwauling. Caterwauling, it should of course be noted, that is assiduously never, ever followed by any type of action. If a new piece of jargon is to enter the Canadian political lexicon it should be the verb ""to Jagmeet Singh."" Definition: to support a political party you claim is taking advantage of Canadians every day and can't be trusted, while simultaneously saying that something must be done and then doing absolutely nothing. (Facultative: Instagram post about a rocking chair good for new mothers. If a free chair is to be had, Singh springs into action and becomes an influencer extraordinaire). The apogee of this shameful and fraudulent behaviour was on display Monday in a fashion that would have made Charles Ponzi blush. Jagmeet Singh stood before a room of journalists to declare that ""Justin Trudeau has to go, he has to resign. And because of that, all options are on the table."" Paul Wells attempted to explain to Singh, as patiently as he could, how a parliament works and asked if Singh would bring down the government, seeing as he had no say in who the leader of the Liberal party was. Singh answered resolutely that ""All options are the table."" Well, knock me down with a feather, Jagmeet Singh won't commit to anything. Does this, perchance, in any way, resemble his refusal to support a Conservative non-confidence motion using his very own words as the text for said non-confidence motion? Why yes it does. Does it also sound like when he proudly announced that he had ""ripped up the supply and confidence agreement"" he had with the Liberals and then steadfastly supported them? Imagine that, it does. Scientists will one day study Singh's musculoskeletal structure for evidence of how humans can remain upright without a backbone. Jagmeet Singh seems to view parliament as a game or a club to drive his Maserati to, rather than the central institution in our democracy. He has, for half-a-decade now, preened in front the cameras while offering nothing of substance to the country or his riding. The last shred of hope Canadians can perhaps cling to is that he will be eligible for his pension in February. Maybe then we will finally be allowed to go to the polls.

Braid: Big win for Nenshi's NDP leadership in high-stakes Lethbridge byelection,2024,"It was just a mid-term byelection, barely noticed by media and the general public, but hugely important for Alberta politics.

The NDP has represented the Lethbridge riding in the Alberta legislature since 2015, when Shannon Phillips was first elected MLA and the party swept into power, but the riding has been without an MLA since Phillips stepped aside July 1 During a brief victory speech, Miyashiro, sporting an orange suit, thanked his campaign team and supporters, and praised Middleton-Hope - a Lethbridge city councillor and former Lethbridge police chief - for running a strong campaign. ""I've heard from parents worried about overcrowded classrooms, from seniors struggling to afford their medications and from so many of you that just want a government that puts people first,"" the former Lethbridge city councillor said Wednesday night at The Zoo, a pub on the University of Lethbridge campus. During an interview Thursday, Miyashiro said it's been decades since the NDP won a provincial byelection, giving a boost to the party and confirming it's competitive in every Alberta riding. ""It's not a bad Christmas present, not bad at all,"" he said. Lethbridge-West residents' biggest concern is health care, said Miyashiro, who's stepping down from his role as executive director of the Lethbridge Senior Citizens Organization. Two family doctors announced during the campaign they are leaving the province, and ""tens of thousands"" of Lethbridge residents are without a family physician, he said. The campaign was a civil one, as both he and Middleton-Hope focused on policy and avoided mud slinging, said Miyashiro. NDP leader Naheed Nenshi, who stood behind Miyashiro on Wednesday as he delivered his speech, said Premier Danielle Smith and the UCP spent ""untold amounts of money"" on negative advertising and cynically put the byelection close to Christmas because they didn't want people to vote. ""They threw everything they could at this campaign, and the people of Lethbridge-West said that's not good enough,"" said the former Calgary mayor. In a Thursday statement, Middleton-Hope said he's ""incredibly grateful"" for the support he and the UCP received during the campaign. ""While the result wasn't what we hoped for, we made significant strides and closed the gap considerably,"" he said. ""It was a tight race, and I'm proud of the effort put in by my team and all our supporters."" John Middleton-Hope. Photo supplied to Postmedia Calgary by John Middleton-Hope Byelection hotly contested, sets turnout record Political sociologist Trevor W. Harrison said Thursday the Lethbridge-West byelection was hotly contested. The New Democrats were desperate to hold on to the seat while the United Conservatives poured in resources in an attempt to knock off the NDP's lone riding in southern Alberta, said the University of Lethbridge professor. ""(The governing UCP) didn't lose anything but on the other hand they lost something they really hoped to win,"" said Harrison. The NDP also threw plenty at the byelection, with Nenshi in Lethbridge on numerous occasions and the party also bringing in numerous MLAs to bolster support. ""This was in some sense almost a proxy war for the coming war to come later in a couple of years,"" said Harrison. For Nenshi, Wednesday's byelection result was an important win, as a loss would have been a blow to the NDP's hopes of forming the next Alberta government, said Harrison. ""(The UCP) wanted in some sense to stall any momentum that the Nenshi-led NDP might have (in Lethbridge),"" he said. The voter turnout of roughly 37 per cent sets a record for an Alberta byelection. ""That's way above what we normally expect,"" said Harrison. More residents voted during the advance poll, which took place over five days last week, than on election day. Of the 13,561 valid votes, 49 per cent were cast during the advance poll while 5,539 Lethbridge-West residents - representing almost 41 per cent of the total votes - got out to vote on Wednesday. Another 1,357 votes were cast by special ballot or mobile. stipper@postmedia.com",Cal gary Herald (Online); Calgary,Calgary,"Tipper, Stephen",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 19, 2024",Older people; Negative campaigning; Political advertising; Elections,Nom: University of Lethbridge; NAICS: 611310,2024-12-19,Calgary Herald

No sign yet of the NDP reining in spending; Pattullo Bridge replacement overrun just one example of dodging budgeting realism,2024,"Through six years and two elections, the NDP swore that the Pattullo Bridge could be replaced for $1.377 billion, all in. They said it in speeches, news releases and during question period in the legislature. ""The simple answer is that $1.377 billion is the cost,"" the NDP transportation minister of the day assured the house back in 2018. ""That is the cost of the Pattullo Bridge."" When the short list of bidders was named the following year, the New Democrats maintained that the budget was already fixed. ""The approved budget of $1.377 billion represents the full cost to complete the project, including procurement, project management, construction, removal of the existing bridge and interest during construction."" In 2020, the government signed the construction contract with the consortium calling itself Fraser Crossing Partners, its cost fixed at $967.5 million. The remainder of the $1.377 billion budget would cover project management, financing, risk management, property acquisition and other project-related costs. Interest costs during construction included? That assertion raised questions about the effect of the supposedly fixed budget, when construction fell a year behind schedule and then a second year behind schedule. After the latter extension, announced in May of this year, the government was still reporting the budget unchanged at $1.377 billion, same as when the schedule called for the crossing to be completed in three years as opposed to the current five years and counting. How could the budget be unchanged after that much of an overrun on the construction schedule? Transportation Minister Rob Fleming took a stab at answering in an interview with Jas Johal on CKNW Radio at the end of May. ""We're pretty good in that regard,"" he claimed. ""We've been very aggressive in managing these contracts."" Fleming didn't seek re-election. But the truth about the NDP's ""aggressive"" management of the project came out in the fine print of this week's quarterly update on provincial finances. After six years on a supposedly fixed budget of $1.377 billion, the cost has now surged by $260 million to $1.637 billion. A 20 per cent increase and it happened almost overnight. The government also announced a smaller, though still significant, seven per cent budget overrun of $127 million on the Broadway subway project. The government provided no detailed explanation for the overruns. But the bridge replacement is one of several overbudget projects to be saddled with one of the NDP's union-favouring community benefit agreements. Hard to believe that there wouldn't have been earlier indications of what was happening with the budget on the Pattullo when they were adding one year, then another to the construction schedule. Perhaps such concerns were not put in writing, for fear that the news might leak before the election. In any event, the Pattullo overrun and apparent coverup were emblematic of this week's mostly discouraging update on provincial finances. The new finance minister, Brenda Bailey, suggested that the New Democrats were rising to the challenge of managing finances. ""We know we have to responsibly manage public resources and you'll see us doing that,"" she told reporters Tuesday. There are no examples of the NDP producing results along those lines. They are reviewing ways to reduce administrative spending in health care. They've announced a ""temporary pause"" in some hirings in the public sector. Meanwhile the deficit is out of control. Last spring, the New Democrats forecast a record $8-billion deficit. Even that amount proved not to be enough to satisfy Premier David Eby's drive to spend. The deficit was boosted by another $1 billion, to $9 billion, in the update on the financial year, released a few weeks before the official start of the election campaign. The NDP line was that nobody cares about debits and deficits, so there was no need to produce a plan to ever bring the books back into balance. Katrine Conroy, Bailey's predecessor as finance minister, laughed at the mere suggestion that such a plan was either possible or necessary. Caught in a tight spot during the campaign, Eby actually conceded the need to some day balance the budget. Bailey, on her appointment as finance minister, pledged to make it a priority. But first, she would make another addition to the deficit. This week's update covering the first six months of the financial year boosted the forecast to $9.4 billion, almost 20 per cent higher than the amount given back in February. Bailey also said the government is still working out how to deliver the ""grocery rebate"" of up to $1,000 per household, promised during the election. The payout has been costed at $1.8 billion, enough to eat up about half of the unallocated contingency funds in the budget. The balance in contingencies, if left untouched until the March 31 end of the financial year - never a good bet with big-spending Eby at the helm - would presumably be enough put a dent in the projected $9.4 billion overrun. That's a long way from saying the New Democrats are getting the books under control. And judging from the evidence to date, one thing they won't be doing is reining in spending. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 19, 2024",Construction contracts; Project management; Budget deficits,,2024-12-19,The Vancouver Sun
Singh is embarrassing himself,2024,"This is going to sound like sarcasm, but I mean with all sincerity: Does Jagmeet Singh understand the assignment? The federal NDP leader has spent this week furrowing his brow and occasionally shaking his first about the outrage he has witnessed on Parliament Hill: That is, Liberal infighting. It's too much, Singh says. The Liberals should be focused on more important things. And that's why he's calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. That is, quite plainly, not up to Jagmeet Singh. He has no more right to demand that the Liberal leader resign than he does to demand that Disney stop remaking old movies or that the Blue Jays sign a power-hitting outfielder. None of it is in his portfolio. What he can do, however, is withdraw support from the Liberal minority government, which he has still not, somehow, managed to do. Singh says he does not want the Liberals to govern. He says it is time for a change. He wants Justin Trudeau to walk into the sea. (Metaphorically.) And yet, every time he has the chance to actually topple the Liberal government, he balks. Just last week, Singh's MPs helped Trudeau pass his GST holiday. It's an odd way to show your displeasure: You guys are the worst. Let me give you a hand. It's not like Singh hasn't had his chances. On Monday, after Chrystia Freeland's surprise resignation, Singh was asked whether he would vote to bring the government down (something he could actually do). ""All options are on the table,"" Singh replied, which is very much not the same thing as ""yes."" Reporters tried again: Would Singh vote against a motion of confidence in the government? ""All options are on the table."" Would he continue to support the government? ""All options are on the table,"" he said again and again, adding, at one point, ""that means anything is possible."" OK, thanks for clarifying. Does it also mean that there is an unlimited range of possibilities? Because that's what I'm thinking. This kind of incoherence is no new thing for the NDP leader. For more than two months now he has clung to a baffling duality: demanding an end to the Liberal government while not actually ending the Liberal government. When Singh announced in early September that he was ""ripping up"" the confidence and supply agreement his party had maintained with the Liberals since 2022, it briefly seemed like an election was on the way, until Singh clarified that actually, no, it wasn't; he was still willing to support the Liberals on a case-by-case basis. Singh's position was ripe for ridicule, but he had no one to blame but himself. In his Rip It Up video, he said it explicitly: ""The Liberals have let people down. They don't deserve another chance from Canadians."" But they do apparently deserve another chance from Jagmeet Singh. And another one. And another one. It's no secret why Singh isn't keen on an election. His NDP is less popular federally than the Liberals, despite the fact that Trudeau is so deeply unliked even his closest ally, Freeland, just told him to get stuffed. Across 42 national polls released since Singh issued his September non-ultimatum, the NDP outperformed the Liberals just once, and only then by a single percentage point. A vote would almost certainly hand Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives a majority and consign Singh to a parliamentary role with zero influence and no leverage. But at this point, that is baked in. The NDP spent years propping up Trudeau, allowed him to take credit for anything the government accomplished, while gaining no electoral benefit for themselves. The horse is already out of the barn, in other words, and frolicking three fields over. At some point, Singh simply has to bring down the government he insists deserves that fate. Talking tough but doing nothing is not just an embarrassment for Singh, it looks bad on his caucus. Why are they still backing a leader who so utterly refuses to lead? I'd say Singh can't keep going on like this, but I suspect he probably can. Scott Stinson is a frequent contributor to the Toronto Star.

Up to Singh; NDP leader has power to end the farce in Ottawa,2024,"Justin Trudeau's latest catastrophe puts an enormous weight on the shoulders of New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh. It also represents a character-testing challenge and an opportunity - or perhaps we should call it a duty - to perform the sort of service to the country he was elected to provide. It's very simple. The NDP leader needs to indicate that the next time a vote of confidence in the government is called, his party will join the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois in withholding its support. That would bring a merciful end to the painful mix of farce and ineptitude that has been on display in Ottawa at a time Canada desperately needs a serious-minded administration to face challenges that are advancing on all sides. While Singh called on Monday for Trudeau to resign, it's not enough. He has the ability to all but force him out, and should use it. Singh's party has been the only leg of a shakey table that's been propping up the Liberals since they eked out another minority in 2021. The NDP leader has used the grip he holds to squeeze money out of the government for such favoured projects as pharmacare and dental care, both of which provide limited benefits to specific recipient groups at serious cost to a treasury that is already deeply in debt. Well, good for him, you might say. What else is the NDP for but to get money for social benefits for those who can't otherwise obtain them? Fair enough. But Canada's finances are now so fraught the prime minister has seen his finance minister tender her resignation while publicly castigating him for pursuing ""costly political gimmicks which we can ill afford and which make Canadians doubt that we recognize the gravity of the moment."" She didn't have to spell out which gimmicks she meant. Canadians had already figured that out for themselves, making clear that they recognized Trudeau's lastminute, desperation-driven unveiling of a Christmas tax break and a $250 handout as a political stunt intended to buy votes. Freeland's departure leaves Trudeau isolated at the top of a regime in which even his most senior cabinet member no longer has confidence. In addition to her role as finance minister, Freeland served as deputy prime minister, a post bestowed on her by Trudeau at a time he recognized her as his most able lieutenant and a possible successor. Yet so corroded has her trust in him become that she chose to walk away just hours before she was due to deliver an economic update intended to set out the country's course at a time of immense uncertainty. Her departure, she said, came after Trudeau chose the Friday before her speech to inform her he no longer wanted her in the job. That inexplicable example of horrific timing came after reports he'd been once-again wooing former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney as her replacement, even though he lacks a seat in the Commons. No one knows what Carney thinks of this mess, as he wisely evaded invitations to share his thoughts. Could anyone with his background possibly throw themselves willingly into a tire fire like the one spewing toxic fumes across Canada's benighted capital? Freeland's rebuke is easily the most damning to strike a flailing prime minister, but adds to a growing body of humiliating rebuffs. His cabinet has been steadily leaking members as ministers depart in search of more secure employment than a government consistently 15-20 points back in the polls, led by a man the majority of Canadians say they wish would resign. A Radio-Canada count in October identified 24 MPs, including half a dozen ministers, who didn't plan to seek re-election. Freeland's resignation came the same day Housing Minister Sean Fraser said he wouldn't run again, and weeks after an attempted caucus uprising against Trudeau. So battered is his standing that the incoming president of the United States has taken to openly mocking him, referring to Trudeau as ""Governor ... of the Great State of Canada."" Billionaire Elon Musk derided him as ""an insufferable tool."" Canada's premiers lectured him over critical remarks on Trump's victory that Ontario Premier Doug Ford denounced as ""not helpful at all."" As it happens, those remarks centred on Americans'failure to choose a female president, an obvious irony now that the only woman ever to serve as Canada's finance minister says she can no longer work with him. The quandary for Singh is whether he should act in the best interests of the country even if it involves risks for his party. Though Liberals claim support from barely a fifth of the electorate, the NDP is slightly lower. An election that sees the decimation of Trudeau's remaining forces won't necessarily result in gains for New Democrats. Then again, it's hard to predict. Trudeau has moved the government sharply to the left; between them, the Liberals and NDP share about 40 per cent of voter support. It's possible a significant number of ""progressives"" who can't bring themselves to back Trudeau again could opt for New Democrats instead, potentially returning the party to the Official Opposition status it held before 2015. The last time the Liberals were ejected from office it took almost a decade to regroup and retool themselves, and in that instance they suffered far less of a pasting than they currently appear headed for. A decade or more as official opposition could do much to establish New Democrats as something other than perennial third-place also-rans. There's also the fact that Canadian voters very clearly want a chance to pass judgment on this government. They don't want to wait 10 more months until Trudeau has no choice but to call a vote. They certainly don't want to be forced to endure another winter, spring and summer of disarray as the prime minister desperately clings to office with the help of a small, cynical coterie of unelected advisers. Canada needs a government that isn't in the process of chewing off its own leg. Jagmeet Singh has the ability to offer that opportunity. A failure to act is the sort of thing restless voters might remember.

"Too much of a good thing: How B.C.’s NDP was punished for record immigration levels:   Premier David Eby, in a year-end interview, said he regrets he didn’t recognize sooner the challenges that fast-growing B.C. communities were facing",2024,"Every month, the population of Surrey, B.C., expands by another 1,200 to 1,500 people, mostly newcomers to Canada. It’s not Roxham Road-level chaos, where thousands of asylum seekers entered Canada monthly via an unofficial border crossing into Quebec before it was closed last year. But it is growth beyond capacity, with everything from schools and hospitals to transit and food banks increasingly stretched. Premier David Eby, in a year-end interview, said he regrets he didn’t recognize sooner the challenges that fast-growing B.C. communities were facing. “I hadn’t seen that as a potential threat to the goals that we’d set out to achieve provincially,” he said. When British Columbia first broke records for immigration in 2021, the provincial government of then-Premier John Horgan welcomed the news, saying it made B.C. a leader in Canada in attracting new talent to address its labour market needs. The province has continued to break its own immigration records and now has the highest proportion of non-permanent residents in the country – roughly one-tenth of the population. It wasn’t until last spring that Mr. Eby began to publicly complain about Ottawa’s handling of the immigration file. He described the federal government’s proposal to have B.C. take in more asylum seekers as “daft.” He also acknowledged that communities were frustrated with the impact on housing and access to health care of a fast-growing population. “For those who are frustrated, I get it. We have about 10,000 people every 37 days moving into the province. Even though we’ve brought on tens of thousands of units of housing. … We need to do more.” But finally acknowledging the problem wasn’t enough. In the October election, the governing NDP paid the price for the province’s growing pains. Those communities with the fastest growth – Surrey, Langley, Chilliwack, to name a few – dumped 11 NDP incumbents. It was a significant rebuke that left Mr. Eby governing with the smallest possible majority. “We’re not keeping up with the services that are required for our population. It’s growing so quickly, and there’s a sense of frustration from the residents,” Surrey city council member Linda Annis said in an interview. She said both the province and the federal government have neglected her fast-growing community, which needs greater investments in schools, hospitals, roads and transit. With 8,000 students sitting in school portables as just one example, she said, Surrey voters used the election to register that frustration. Mr. Eby, who spent much of the election campaign focused on the Surrey battleground ridings, agreed that long wait times at Surrey Memorial Hospital’s emergency department are a problem. Up into the Fraser Valley, he recalled speaking with a school superintendent who told him he was lying awake at night worrying about how to accommodate the influx of students. Ottawa has now tabled a plan to reduce immigration numbers over the next three years, but B.C. still faces challenges in accommodating its current population. “Quebec and Ontario have seen way more asylum seekers than British Columbia has,” Mr. Eby said. “The immigration challenges in British Columbia have a very different kind of appearance. It’s around just volumes of people, just the sheer number of temporary workers, international students, as well as traditional immigration streams, and in our ability to provide just the infrastructure for services.” Mr. Eby is calling for more infrastructure funding from Ottawa and has been increasingly vocal about what he describes as blatant federal favouritism toward Ontario and Quebec. B.C. has secured just $6-million in federal interim housing funding out of the $1-billion that has been spread across the country. “It’s hard to explain, except for me to reach the unavoidable conclusion that consistently, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s immigration or economic stimulus or equalization or you name it, British Columbia does not get as much as other provinces.” Jeffrey MacDonald, a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, said the federal government’s Interim Housing Assistance Plan is intended to reimburse provinces for a portion of the money they spend on housing for asylum claimants. But the money is not calculated on a per-capita basis, he said in a statement. Instead, provinces and municipalities have to apply for reimbursement. The statement said Quebec had benefited from the program, as well as separate money specifically designated to that province. “On June 10, 2024, the federal government announced a pledge of $750 million to the Government of Quebec, in recognition of housing and other services costs associated with the influx of asylum claimants between 2021 and 2023, particularly at Roxham Road,” Mr. MacDonald said in his statement. “While a portion of this amount is covered under IHAP, the majority of the funding is separate from the program.” Besides funding, Mr. Eby would also like to see British Columbia have more influence over its immigration decisions. “There’s an opportunity, in my opinion, for the province to take more control over the immigration system and to do a bit more nuanced job than Ottawa in responding to those areas where we’re short of people with the skills that we need, but balancing that with our ability to provide housing and services.” He said British Columbians understand the importance of immigration to the economy. “And simultaneously, they do understand that there is too much of a good thing – if we’re unable to provide the basics.”",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Hunter, Justine",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 18, 2024",Provinces; Federal government; Local elections; Students; Political asylum; Funding; Immigration,,2024-12-18,The Globe and Mail
NDP government still out front — but has to deliver,2024,"Manitoba’s NDP government is still flying high in public opinion polls. That should not come as a great surprise. The public usually gives new governments a grace period to settle into office before holding them accountable for their election commitments. It has been more than a year since Premier Wab Kinew and the NDP were sworn into office after winning the Oct. 3, 2023 provincial election. A new Free Press- Probe poll says 53 per cent of Manitobans would vote for the NDP if an election were held today. That is down slightly from 56 per cent in September, but still higher than the 45 per cent the party drew in last year’s election. Support in Winnipeg is even higher for the NDP at 61 per cent. That’s up close to 10 percentage points compared with last year’s election. The NDP won 28 of 32 seats in the capital city in 2023. It has since added another seat in Winnipeg after winning a byelection in the constituency of Tuxedo earlier this year. It was held to replace former Progressive Conservative premier Heather Stefanson, who retired from politics in April. The byelection result was especially damaging to the PC brand, since the party had never lost Tuxedo prior to this year. What the latest polling numbers show is that the NDP has an abundance of political capital to spend before the next provincial election, scheduled for October 2027. It can afford to make some unpopular decisions, or fail to make good on some election promises, and still be competitive in the next election. That contest is still far away; three years is a long time in politics. Nevertheless, it doesn’t appear any of the perceived mistakes Kinew and the NDP have made so far have hurt them at the polls, including the expulsion from caucus of NDP MLA Mark Wasyliw in September. The NDP said it removed Wasyliw, a defence lawyer, because of his affiliation with a law partner who was defending convicted sexual predator Peter Nygard. The NDP was roundly criticized for the move, as it seemed to fly in the face of a person’s right under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms to a legal defence in criminal proceedings. Similarly, the NDP did not appear to suffer politically after failing to consult with the community prior to selecting a location for the province’s first supervised consumption site on Disraeli Freeway in Point Douglas. The NDP government applied to Health Canada for an exemption under the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act before speaking with area residents and community stakeholders. These types of political errors do eventually catch up with governments. But it’s still too early in the NDP’s mandate for those missteps to have had a material impact on its popularity. That will likely change as time goes on, especially if government fails to deliver on some of its key election promises, such as reducing hospital wait times. After a year in government, the NDP has not been able to bring down emergency room wait times, which were largely unchanged in Winnipeg at 3.43 hours (median wait time) in October, compared with 3.53 hours for the same month in 2023. Meanwhile, wait times across the province for hip and knee replacement surgery are slightly longer in 2024 than in 2023, according to the province’s most recent wait time data. For now, most Manitobans appear to be satisfied with their provincial government. But things change. After this poll was taken, the government released that this year’s deficit had jumped by $531 million — something voters might not approve of. The NDP should not take Manitobans’ support for granted as it enters the second year of its mandate.

Adam Pankratz: Jagmeet Singh can't see past his Maserati parking spot,2024,"The shallowest man in Canada had quite the day on Monday when Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland launched her volley of Molotov cocktails on the way out the door. Years of hypocrisy, pandering, and spinelessness laid bare for all the world to see as now former minister Freeland apparently decided she had had quite enough of bilking Canadians and subjecting them to ludicrous policies for the sole purpose of political expediency. What will this poor man do now? I refer, of course, to Jagmeet Singh. Jagmeet Singh has made a specialty of failing upwards. Since his election to the head of the NDP, he has been hailed as a new type of leader which would pull the Dippers forward and towards power. He has, however, never done anything of the sort, despite the Liberals doing their best to hand him votes. Let's all cast our minds back to the 2019 election when, following Justin Trudeau's apparent over-enthusiasm for dress-up parties and makeup, we were assured that the NDP would make large gains in marginal ridings around the country. Nothing ever materialized, even in British Columbia where, at the time, the Trans Mountain pipeline was a hot button issue the NDP were salivating over. Singh's own riding of Burnaby South covers half of the city in which the TMX pipeline terminates, yet he could do nothing to carry the message. This is, of course, partly because Singh never actually spends any time in Burnaby, but has the added feature of also being nationally embarrassing. The story was largely the same in 2021, when Canadians returned an essentially unchanged parliament following Trudeau's COVID-19 election. The NDP still languished a distant third, unable to convince Canada they had anything to offer. Now, with the Liberals in freefall, polls all have the NDP stagnant while Canadians, especially younger ones, flock to the Conservatives. It's a stunning indictment of NDP appeal under Singh. In all of this, the only time the NDP seat count changed significantly was when it went from 44 to 24 seats in 2019. Yet, fate decided that the Liberals would need NDP support to keep their government going, and so the country has been subjected to five years of Jagmeet Singh's caterwauling. Caterwauling, it should of course be noted, that is assiduously never, ever followed by any type of action. If a new piece of jargon is to enter the Canadian political lexicon it should be the verb ""to Jagmeet Singh."" Definition: to support a political party you claim is taking advantage of Canadians every day and can't be trusted, while simultaneously saying that something must be done and then doing absolutely nothing. (Facultative: Instagram post about a rocking chair good for new mothers. If a free chair is to be had, Singh springs into action and becomes an influencer extraordinaire). The apogee of this shameful and fraudulent behaviour was on display Monday in a fashion that would have made Charles Ponzi blush. Jagmeet Singh stood before a room of journalists to declare that ""Justin Trudeau has to go, he has to resign. And because of that, all options are on the table."" Paul Wells attempted to explain to Singh, as patiently as he could, how a parliament works and asked if Singh would bring down the government, seeing as he had no say in who the leader of the Liberal Party was. Singh answered resolutely that ""All options are the table."" Well, knock me down with a feather, Jagmeet Singh won't commit to anything. Does this, perchance, in any way, resemble his refusal to support a Conservative non-confidence motion using his very own words as the text for said non-confidence motion? Why yes it does. Does it also sound like when he proudly announced that he had ""ripped up the supply and confidence agreement"" he had with the Liberals and then steadfastly supported them? Imagine that, it does. Scientists will one day study Singh's musculoskeletal structure for evidence of how humans can remain upright without a backbone. Jagmeet Singh seems to view parliament as a game or a club to drive his Maserati to, rather than the central institution in our democracy. He has, for half a decade now, preened in front the cameras while offering nothing of substance to the country or his riding. The last shred of hope Canadians can perhaps cling to is that he will be eligible for his pension in February. Maybe then we will finally be allowed to go to the polls.

"The biggest loser in freeland crisis is not justin trudeau; It's you and me; NDP's Singh has opportunity to come out a winner, but he seems unwilling to take it",2024,"The biggest loser out of the Freeland resignation crisis? Not Justin Trudeau, not Jagmeet Singh, even as both are wallowing in the tub of butter of their own self-interest rather than focusing on what's best for Canadians. The biggest loser is Alberta. It's Canada. It's you and me. We face the biggest economic threat in decades with the 25 per cent Trump tariffs looming, but Trudeau's government is simultaneously preening, insulting and obstinate about Trump's demands while at the same time collapsing into a sinkhole of internal chaos. A federal election is our obvious need. Every reasonable Canadian wants one, even the few reasonable Canadians remaining in Trudeau's own party. They've now turned on him, with Trudeau's strongest ally Chrystia Freeland leading the way with her resignation as Finance Minister and her penning of the finest ever ""Dear Justin"" letter. Freeland hammered her former best bud on everything from failing to take a true Team Canada approach on negotiations with Trump to allowing the flight of financial investment from Canada to the U.S. She then went for the political kill shot, implying that Trudeau wasn't working for the people any more, but was putting himself first with ""costly political gimmicks."" This was a clear reference to Trudeau's planned borrowing spree so he can buy off voters with a $250 rebate even as the country is gagging on debt. We learned Monday there's $62 billion more debt to swallow this fiscal year, obliterating the Liberals'so-called $40 billion debt ceiling. The calls for Trudeau to resign or call an election came from all corners Monday. Liberal MP Anthony Housefather called for Trudeau to pack it in, as did fellow Liberal MP Francis Drouin, both on CTV. ""He needs to go,"" said Drouin. ""I think today's resignation is a sign of that."" And Bloc Québécois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet: ""Mr. Trudeau's government is over."" Blanchet said we need a January 2025 election ""in order for Quebecers and Canadians to compose a new Parliament that will have the mandate to deal with the real crisis at hand, which is the most important crisis in terms of diplomacy and trade between Canada and United States in recent history."" Of course, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre - who has been about 20 points ahead in the polls for a year now - also called for an immediate election. Poilievre listed Canada's woes: the lack of fiscal stability during a potential trade war, the inflationary carbon tax, government spending and the federal bureaucracy doubling in size during Trudeau's reign, housing costs rising with 1,400 encampments in Ontario alone, as many as 500,000 people in the country illegally, gun crime doubling, and 47,000 drug overdose deaths since 2015: ""We cannot accept this kind of chaos, division, weakness while we're staring down the barrel of a 25 per cent tariff from our biggest trading partner and closest ally today, which, by the way, is headed by a newly-elected president with a strong and fresh mandate, a man who can spot weakness from a mile away."" Perhaps the most insightful comment came from a non-partisan source, pollster Nik Nanos. Nanos told CTV that Freeland just threw Trudeau under the political bus, but this has opened the door for a bold move from the NDP's Jagmeet Singh: ""I think the big story is Jagmeet Singh. If Jagmeet Singh wants to be that progressive alternative to the Conservatives, this week is probably the day to kind of stand with the other opposition parties and demand an election because that will force the Liberals to run under Justin Trudeau. He's back on his heels, and, you know, one of his most loyal supporters and colleagues just basically destroyed him today."" But - at least as of my late afternoon deadline - the one person in Ottawa who could bring down the government, refused to do so, with Singh lamely calling for Trudeau to resign instead of forcing a non-confidence vote. I've never put much credence in the talk that Singh is holding out to qualify for his $2.2 million pension in February before he brings down the government, but given Singh's ongoing harsh rebukes of Trudeau, Trudeau's new and most devastating political crisis, and Nanos's sage analysis, Singh is either a timid hypocrite afraid to take a political gamble or a self-serving greedhead putting his pension ahead of the public interest. Why won't he act? We know by now we can't count on Trudeau to do the right thing for Canada. The clock is ticking on Singh. Meanwhile, this country is running on fumes, leaking oil and driving on four flats. We're desperate for a new driver, no?

"B.C. Insider: Province’s fiscal update already having an impact:   The BC NDP faces criticism over a ballooning deficit, but opposition parities are tackling their own problems",2024,"Good morning. While Ottawa is rife with political intrigue after the dramatic resignation of Chrystia Freeland as finance minister on Monday, British Columbia is having its own spate of drama. The province will deliver its second quarterly fiscal update today, later than the Nov. 30 deadline the law stipulates in a non-election year, but within the extra time allowed because of the October vote. Indications are that whatever the results are, they are already having an impact. Last Tuesday, Premier David Eby told members of the BC Chamber of Commerce that his government had work to do “around the administration of government services and ensuring that that is right-sized for the work that’s actually out there.” The Premier promised the business audience that his government would “reset” its relationship with them. The next day, B.C.’s head of the public service announced that the government would freeze hiring for the civil service. Public-sector unions were big boosters of the NDP in the last provincial election. Paul Finch, president of the BC General Employees’ Union, which represents the majority of unionized civil-service workers, was perplexed in an interview with reporter Justine Hunter. Contract negotiations with public-sector unions are to begin in January, but the BC NDP has been facing mounting criticism about its ballooning deficit. The red ink predicted when the budget was introduced last February amounted to $7.9-billion, but that climbed to $9-billion after the first quarterly update in September. Election promises, including a grocery rebate for most households, are expected to push the deficit up to at least $10-billion, though that money hasn’t yet been spent: It will be in addition to whatever the updated deficit will be. A co-operation agreement with the two Green MLAs in the legislature is expected to add $200-million in spending, though it’s unclear whether that will be new money or money found within the existing budget. Standard & Poor’s downgraded the province’s credit rating this year from AA to AA- in response to the record deficit tabled in February. Moody’s still gives B.C. a triple-A rating over the long term but has downgraded its outlook to negative. All of this would be cannon fodder for B.C.’s opposition parties, but they are having their own problems. The Conservatives, who form the Official Opposition with 44 seats to the NDP’s 47, ran in the election in part on a platform of better fiscal management. But even before its MLAs – the vast majority of them rookies – take their seats in the legislative chamber, Conservative Leader John Rustad was fielding questions last week about whether his oft-stated commitment to allowing his members to speak their minds was going to be workable. In a letter leaked to radio host Jas Johal, 13 new Conservative MLAs rebuked their colleague Elenore Sturko after she publicly supported the decision of a Vancouver police board member to resign for making comments she said could be offensive toward ethnic and gender minorities. What followed was a Monty Pythonesque spectacle: The 13, who decried Sturko’s comments as evidence of cancel culture, wanted their leader to instead cancel Sturko, calling on him to make her apologize. Rustad had two choices: abide by his commitment to allow his MLAs to speak out – including Sturko. Or side with the letter-writers who wanted him to reaffirm his commitment to free speech, in part by disciplining one of their colleagues who had exercised hers. Rustad tried to do both: He posted a photo of himself with the ousted police board member and urged Sturko to meet with her, without ordering her to do anything. She declined. “We are redefining a political party,” he said in an interview with Justine the day his caucus met to hash out their differences. A year ago, British Columbians had another opposition and a different alternative to either the NDP or the Conservatives. That evaporated in late August when then-BC United leader Kevin Falcon, without consulting with his candidates, cancelled the party’s campaign and urged British Columbians to get behind the Conservatives. But the party still maintains an office, a few staff and its registration as a political party. As such, it has debt, lots of it. According to notes obtained by Justine from an internal meeting of BC United, the once-dominant party owes $930,000 to vendors and $270,000 to staff. It has only $170,000 in cash on hand, but its monthly costs are $92,000. The party is begging its supporters for help, but it’s unclear who might be willing to extend charity: Those who supported Falcon’s decision to collapse the campaign in favour of the Conservatives have a new suitor to support. Those who were furious about the decision aren’t likely feeling generous. According to the notes, though, swag is available for purchase for any true believers.

Kelly McParland: Time for Jagmeet Singh to put Liberals out of their misery,2024,"Justin Trudeau's latest catastrophe puts an enormous weight on the shoulders of New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh. It also represents a character-testing challenge and an opportunity - or perhaps we should call it a duty - to perform the sort of service to the country he was elected to provide. It's very simple. The NDP leader needs to indicate that the next time a vote of confidence in the government is called, his party will join the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois in withholding its support. That would bring a merciful end to the painful mix of farce and ineptitude that has been on display in Ottawa at a time Canada desperately needs a serious-minded administration to face challenges that are advancing on all sides. While Singh called on Monday for Trudeau to resign, it's not enough. He has the ability to all but force him out, and should use it. Singh's party has been the only leg of a shakey table that's been propping up the Liberals since they eked out another minority in 2021. The NDP leader has used the grip he holds to squeeze money out of the government for such favoured projects as pharmacare and dental care, both of which provide limited benefits to specific recipient groups at serious cost to a treasury that is already deeply in debt. Well, good for him, you might say. What else is the NDP for but to get money for social benefits for those who can't otherwise obtain them? Fair enough. But Canada's finances are now so fraught the prime minister has seen his finance minister tender her resignation while publicly castigating him for pursuing ""costly political gimmicks which we can ill afford and which make Canadians doubt that we recognize the gravity of the moment."" She didn't have to spell out which gimmicks she meant. Canadians had already figured that out for themselves, making clear that they recognized Trudeau's last-minute, desperation-driven unveiling of a Christmas tax break and a $250 handout as a political stunt intended to buy votes. Freeland's departure leaves Trudeau isolated at the top of a regime in which even his most senior cabinet member no longer has confidence. In addition to her role as finance minister, Freeland served as deputy prime minister, a post bestowed on her by Trudeau at a time he recognized her as his most able lieutenant and a possible successor. Yet so corroded has her trust in him become that she chose to walk away just hours before she was due to deliver an economic update intended to set out the country's course at a time of immense uncertainty. Her departure, she said, came after Trudeau chose the Friday before her speech to inform her he no longer wanted her in the job. That inexplicable example of horrific timing came after reports he'd been once-again wooing former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney as her replacement, even though he lacks a seat in the Commons. No one knows what Carney thinks of this mess, as he wisely evaded invitations to share his thoughts. Could anyone with his background possibly throw themselves willingly into a tire fire like the one spewing toxic fumes across Canada's benighted capital? Freeland's rebuke is easily the most damning to strike a flailing prime minister, but adds to a growing body of humiliating rebuffs. His cabinet has been steadily leaking members as ministers depart in search of more secure employment than a government consistently 15-20 points back in the polls, led by a man the majority of Canadians say they wish would resign. A Radio-Canada count in October identified 24 MPs, including half a dozen ministers, who didn't plan to seek re-election. Freeland's resignation came the same day Housing Minister Sean Fraser said he wouldn't run again, and weeks after an attempted caucus uprising against Trudeau. So battered is his standing that the incoming president of the United States has taken to openly mocking him, referring to Trudeau as ""Governor ... of the Great State of Canada."" Billionaire Elon Musk derided him as ""an insufferable tool."" Canada's premiers lectured him over critical remarks on Trump's victory that Ontario Premier Doug Ford denounced as ""not helpful at all."" As it happens, those remarks centred on Americans' failure to choose a female president, an obvious irony now that the only woman ever to serve as Canada's finance minister says she can no longer work with him. The quandary for Singh is whether he should act in the best interests of the country even if it involves risks for his party. Though Liberals claim support from barely a fifth of the electorate, the NDP is slightly lower. An election that sees the decimation of Trudeau's remaining forces won't necessarily result in gains for New Democrats. Then again, it's hard to predict. Trudeau has moved the government sharply to the left; between them, the Liberals and NDP share about 40 per cent of voter support. It's possible a significant number of ""progressives"" who can't bring themselves to back Trudeau again could opt for New Democrats instead, potentially returning the party to the Official Opposition status it held before 2015. The last time the Liberals were ejected from office it took almost a decade to regroup and retool themselves, and in that instance they suffered far less of a pasting than they currently appear headed for. A decade or more as official opposition could do much to establish New Democrats as something other than perennial third-place also-rans. There's also the fact that Canadian voters very clearly want a chance to pass judgement on this government. They don't want to wait 10 more months until Trudeau has no choice but to call a vote. They certainly don't want to be forced to endure another winter, spring and summer of disarray as the prime minister desperately clings to office with the help of a small, cynical coterie of unelected advisors. Canada needs a government that isn't in the process of chewing off its own leg. Jagmeet Singh has the ability to offer that opportunity. A failure to act is the sort of thing restless voters might remember.

"Chrystia Freeland’s resignation from Trudeau’s cabinet prompts reactions from across the political landscape:   Politicians from Liberal, Conservative and NDP parties as well as other Canadians voiced how they felt about the decision",2024,"In the wake of Chrystia Freeland’s resignation from Justin Trudeau’s cabinet on the day she was set to deliver the fall economic statement, political leaders have been reacting to the loss for the Liberals and the longtime politician’s reputation and impact. The reactions came from those who worked alongside her in the House of Commons, as well as people who run organizations affected by her ministerial positions in the Trudeau government, which included international trade, intergovernmental affairs, foreign affairs, finance minister and deputy prime minister over the past nine years. Calls for Trudeau to step down and for an election to be held Many well-known political names used the moment to call for either Justin Trudeau’s resignation, or for the NDP to call for a vote of non-confidence. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre held a news conference, saying the Prime Minister has lost control and urged the NDP to join the other opposition parties to defeat the minority Liberal government. “The minister of finance resigned in the middle of an economic crisis and one fifth of his caucus has lost confidence in him. That shows Justin Trudeau has lost control but he is hanging onto power,” he said. “Everything is spiraling out of control.” In a press release, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh wrote, in part, “The withering resignation of Trudeau’s right-hand minister shows just how deeply this Liberal government’s members are obsessed with infighting, and ignoring the urgent challenges everyday Canadians are coping with. “While the Liberals fight with each other, I believe we should be fighting for Canadian jobs at risk from Donald Trump’s tariffs. While Trudeau obsesses over his own drama, I believe we should be focused on the cost of homes and groceries that are burning up people’s paycheques and dimming hope.” Former Trudeau cabinet minister Jody Wilson-Raybould who resigned in 2019 over the SNC-Lavalin affair, wrote, “Justin Trudeau-#itstime, long past time to go.” B.C. Liberal MP Patrick Weiler, who supported a secret ballot on whether Mr. Trudeau should run again in November, put out a statement reiterating his call for the Prime Minister to step aside and begin a leadership process. John Ruffolo, founder of tech investing firm OMERS Ventures, said the government is now in “free fall,” and wrote that the NDP needed to call for a vote of non-confidence. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner posted a series of tweets Monday morning calling for a federal election, several of which included a dumpster on fire. Shock and surprise Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford said “we all are” concerned about Freeland’s resignation, referring to himself and the other premiers. On her way into a cabinet meeting Monday morning, Transport Minister and Treasury Board President Anita Anand said: “Chrystia Freeland is a good friend, someone I work with very closely … this news has hit me really hard."" Support for Freeland Housing Minister Sean Fraser, who also resigned from his position Monday, said that he considers Ms. Freeland “a friend, and that friendship will continue long after my time in politics.” Liberal MP Anthony Housefeather wrote, “All my strength and support to Chrystia Freeland. Since 2015 she has more than earned my trust and friendship.” Dan Kelly, the president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business noted that, “While we disagreed often, Chrystia Freeland was easily the most accessible federal or provincial Finance Minister I’ve worked with in my 30+ years CFIB career.” Alexandra Chyczij, national president of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, put out a statement saying, in part, “On behalf of the Ukrainian Canadian community, I thank the Honourable Chrystia Freeland for her many years of exemplary public service to Canada in Cabinet and for her steadfast and unequivocal support for Ukraine.” Former Conservative cabinet minister Lisa Raitt tweeted simply, “#TeamChrystia.” With reports from Robert Fife and Marieke Walsh",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,,The Globe and Mail,"Dec 16, 2024",Resignations; Friendship; Political leadership; Prime ministers,,2024-12-16,The Globe and Mail
"Manitoba NDP's popularity holds firm:   More than half back Kinew government, with Winnipeg support especially strong",2024,"A slight dip in support won’t prevent Manitoba New Democrats from ending 2024 on a high. Premier Wab Kinew’s party continues to hold a significant grip on the population, with more than half of Manitobans saying they’d vote for him again, as per a Free Press -Probe Research poll. “It’s very much the same,” Probe partner Mary Agnes Welch said. “The NDP is still in a good phase.” The December omnibus survey suggests 53 per cent would cast a ballot for the NDP, down three percentage points from September, but still eight points higher than the 45 per cent of the vote they garnered in the 2023 provincial election. Kinew’s support in Winnipeg, where he took 28 of 32 seats in the 2023 vote, remains extremely strong; the poll found 61 per cent preferred his party, up about 10 percentage points from the election. NDP support is high across the board, including in the suburbs (61 per cent), which are traditionally more conservative. “You can’t win a provincial election without winning much of Winnipeg,” University of Manitoba political studies adjunct Prof. Christopher Adams said. Winnipeg was referred to by the Progressive Conservatives as “Fortress Winnipeg” during the NDP years under Gary Doer and into Greg Selinger’s first term, Adams said. “So, I always look to see if Winnipeg is looking like a fortress again, and it does look like it,” Adams said. “I would say the PCs are going downward rather than upward in Winnipeg. They need to work on that.” Two factors are contributing to that, including the extended honeymoon for Kinew and the lack of a permanent leader of the PC party, he said. “Their opposition has been muted somewhat since the last election,” Adams said. “A number of us political studies folks (expect) the PCs to sort of start to come back after their next convention.” The survey found one-third of Manitobans approve of the work interim PC leader Wayne Ewasko is doing. Ewasko will make way for Fort Whyte MLA Obby Khan or longtime PC member Wally Daudrich when the party picks a new leader in April. “We remain focused on holding the NDP accountable on behalf of Manitobans, whether it’s ER closures, skyrocketing surgical and diagnostic wait times, out-of-control crime or the growing cost-of-living crisis,” Ewasko said in an email Friday. “After 14 months in office, the NDP has yet to show Manitobans a long-term plan or vision for the future of our province.” That hasn’t stunted Kinew’s popularity. Kinew remains the most popular premier in Canada, with a 67 per cent approval rating, a recent Angus Reid survey found. His rating climbed one percentage point since September. Women (64 per cent), most demographic groups, Indigenous (61 per cent) and racialized voters (60 per cent), and voters with higher formal education (66 per cent) are more likely to back the NDP. Adams said when the PCs win elections in Manitoba, there’s no difference between men and women in their support for the PCs or the NDP. While 44 per cent of men support the PCs, only 25 per cent of women would vote the same way. “The PCs, as they get toward the next election, have to improve their support in Winnipeg, and their support among women,” Adams said, noting that when former premier Brian Pallister was successful, he ran ads that appealed to women by softening his image. Welch said she wonders whether Kinew’s honeymoon period is starting to dip slightly. She pointed to a question that asked Manitobans their feelings about Kinew and his government. While the majority of Manitobans continue to feel positive about the NDP administration, those who described themselves as “enthusiastic” and “happy” dipped slightly compared with September figures. More people shifted to feeling “satisfied” and “indifferent,” while negative emotions — “disappointed” and upset” — dropped slightly. The number of people who identified as “angry” increased slightly. Overall negative emotions fell five percentage points to 16 per cent in September, while positive feelings dropped two points, to 54 per cent. “I wonder if it will be a harbinger of whether or not the honeymoon is over,” Welch said. “An extraordinary honeymoon period brings really high expectations, and the only place to go is down. Soon, we are going to be asking about real progress in health care and homelessness.” Adams questioned whether those nagging issues will affect the next poll results in March. For its part, the NDP said it will stay the course. “We will continue to work hard every day to (fix) our health-care system after years of cuts under Heather Stefanson and the PCs and make your life more affordable,” an NDP spokesperson said in an email Friday. Support for the Tories remained unchanged at 34 per cent despite a two-point dip in Winnipeg. The Liberals have plummeted to seven per cent support from 15 per cent since the last election. Adams suggested the lack of a permanent leader is a factor. Twenty-four per cent of those polled approved of interim leader Cindy Lamoureux, a drop of six points from September. “I think the Liberal brand is very poor right now in Manitoba, and the federal Liberals, as they do poorly, it often overlaps with the provincial Liberals in terms of their popularity,” Adams said. The NDP lost ground outside Winnipeg, down five points to 43 per cent from September — statistically tied with the Progressive Conservatives. “It’s highly unusual,” Adams said, with the caveat of a smaller sample of people polled outside the city. “Regardless, it shows the NDP is strong across the province.” The poll of 1,000 Manitoba adults was taken from Nov. 26 to Dec. 10. The poll is considered accurate plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 95 per cent of the time. scott.billeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Scott Billeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Billeck, Scott",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 16, 2024",Provincial elections; Election results; Women; Voters,,2024-12-16,Winnipeg Free Press
Thousands mourn former B.C. premier John Horgan:   Memorial service for the popular NDP leader was filled with humorous stories and heartfelt memories,2024,"About 3,000 people gathered on Sunday to honour the life of John Horgan, the popular former premier of British Columbia and Canada’s ambassador to Germany, after his death by cancer last month at the age of 65. The attendees, who ranged from dignitaries and Indigenous elders to New Democratic Party loyalists and ordinary British Columbians, were present at a provincial state memorial service that was, at Mr. Horgan’s instructions, anything but stuffy. The NDP premier from 2017 to 2022 is known for steering his province through climate catastrophes, the COVID-19 pandemic and divisive environmental battles. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his eulogy, described Mr. Horgan as “quick-witted and brilliant, but unflinching in his values and beliefs.” But he was remembered Sunday for his litany of corny dad jokes, his love of sports and television series Star Trek, and his boundless energy for serving the people of British Columbia. The string of speakers shared light-hearted memories of a garrulous Irishman with an irrepressible sense of humour and an unerring sense of purpose and direction. Mr. Trudeau described how Mr. Horgan, as the head of the Council of the Federation, sat him down in Victoria in 2022 for a long night of “too many pizzas and not enough beers” to hammer out an agreement between the federal government and the provinces on health care funding. Disagreements over funding levels had marked decades of federal-provincial relations, but the COVID pandemic had exposed the cracks in the system, and Mr. Horgan was persuasive. The Prime Minister finally agreed to deliver tens of billions of dollars in new funding to reduce wait lists and boost mental-health supports. “It was John who made it happen that night. That was one of his last acts as premier and I can’t think of a better legacy than that,” he told the service. British Columbia’s Lieutenant-Governor, Janet Austin, remembered Mr. Horgan as a leader who did not seek power: “Despite his many contributions and accomplishments, he was without ego,” she said. “He was entrusted with power because he would use it wisely and for all the right reasons.” Ms. Austin asked Mr. Horgan to form a government in 2017 after he brokered a minority government based on an agreement with the Greens. Mr. Horgan routinely polled as one of the country’s most popular premiers despite – or perhaps because – he led the province through one of its most tumultuous periods. B.C.’s current NDP Premier, David Eby, Mr. Horgan’s successor, marvelled at his mentor’s popularity: “As politicians, a lot of us here are wondering – man, he left politics more popular than when he entered. How did he do it?” Mr. Eby was one of the New Democrats who “strong-armed” Mr. Horgan into accepting the role as leader of the opposition in 2014 when the NDP ranks were demoralized by successive electoral defeats. Mr. Horgan, as NDP leader, reinvented the party as a pragmatic and moderate centre-left vehicle that became electable again after 16 years of rejection by B.C. voters. Mr. Eby listed Mr. Horgan’s broad scope of accomplishments in just five years as premier, from a transformative change in the relationship with First Nations to smaller but life-altering policies to waive tuition fees for former children in government care. Sunday’s service was held not far from the Langford, B.C., neighbourhood where he grew up and later returned to raise a family and serve as MLA from 2005 to 2023. Ravi Parmar, who replaced Mr. Horgan as the MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca, told reporters the former premier chose the Q Centre Arena in Colwood for the service because it is home to his beloved Victoria Shamrocks lacrosse team. Mr. Parmar recalled how, as premier, Mr. Horgan would ditch his RCMP security detail on weekends to attend games with his wife, Ellie. On Sunday, their seats were reserved and draped in team jerseys. Carole James, who served as Mr. Horgan’s finance minister, noted that Mr. Horgan chaffed in the role as opposition leader because he could not enact change but came into his own when he found himself in the premier’s office: “No one was more surprised than John by how much he loved the job.” After leaving his role as B.C.’s 36th premier, Mr. Horgan was appointed as Canada’s ambassador to Germany last year. He died at a Victoria hospital on Nov. 12 after his third bout with cancer since 2008. He leaves his wife of 45 years and their two sons, Evan and Nate. The crowd rose to their feet in applause for the two sons. Evan Horgan choked up as he said he had hoped for more time with his father. “He taught us about integrity, humility, honesty,” he said, adding that his father didn’t really care for pomp and circumstance. “He was always the same guy, John from Langford.” Evan Horgan was the last member of the family to see his father before he died in hospital: “I asked him what he would want me to say about him. He said, ‘Just tell everyone to do their level best.’ ”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Hunter, Justine",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 16, 2024",Federal provincial relations; Funding; Prime ministers; Pandemics; COVID-19; Deaths,,2024-12-16,The Globe and Mail
"Harshandeep Singh was killed while working as a security guard. At a memorial, Alberta first responders claimed him as one of their own",2024,"Sikh prayers blended with the piped strains of Amazing Grace as the young security guard killed on the job earlier this month was laid to rest with full first responder honours. Hundreds gathered at an Edmonton funeral home Sunday to pay respects to 20-year-old Harshandeep Singh, who was shot and killed while patrolling a central Edmonton apartment building Dec. 6. Singh's loved ones were ushered into the room by an honour guard of police, peace officers, sheriffs and firefighters - who have claimed Singh as one of their own. ""We identify him as a first responder,"" said Jerry Galliford, a provincial sheriff and president of the Alberta First Responders Association, which helped organize the memorial. ""He may be a civilian member, but he's on the front lines. He's putting himself at risk. He's a professional, and that's how we identify a first responder."" Galliford hopes Singh's death leads to more recognition of the dangers security guards face. ""I hope that it does make some changes, because it's necessary. I think I heard a stat that there are seven security officers for every police officer, which is a dramatic number."" 'They've been in his shoes' A turban and badge are carried past the honour guard during an Alberta First Responders Association memorial for Harshandeep Singh at the Edmonton Crematorium and Funeral Home in Edmonton on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024. Singh was killed in a central Edmonton apartment building while on his third day working as a security guard. David Bloom/Postmedia Singh came to Canada a year and a half ago in hopes of a better life for himself and his family. He studied business at NorQuest College and hoped to become a police officer. Gagandeep Ghuman, who delivered a eulogy on behalf of Singh's family, called him a ""beacon"" of joy and positivity. Singh grew up on a farm in India's northern Haryana state where he learned the values of hard work and humility. He carefully saved every dollar he earned in Canada, sending money home to his parents and sister. Singh was shot and killed in a stairwell at 10603 107 Ave. early Dec. 6. Leaked security footage purporting to show his final moments shows a gun-wielding man shooting him in the back after shoving him down the stairs. Singh worked for National Security Guard Protection Services and had been on the job for just three days, a family spokesperson said. Evan Rain and Judith Saulteaux, both 30, were arrested and charged with first-degree murder. They remain in custody pending a bail hearing early next year. Galliford was unsurprised by the identity of the accused. ""When I was a correctional peace officer, I actually had the accused on my unit,"" he said. ""So I'm not shocked by this turn of events, but I am devastated. Everybody's devastated."" Thirty per cent of the first responders' association - which began two years ago as a Facebook group - started their careers in security, Galliford said. ""They've been in his shoes. Some of our members have been in that building working security. So it hits deep."" Attendees at Sunday's memorial included first responders, fellow security guards, members of Edmonton's Sikh community, Singh's extended family and Mayor Amarjeet Sohi. Singh's open casket sat at the front of the room flanked by garlands and flowers. Many wore Sikh head scarves, while uniformed first responders removed their caps as a show of respect. Singh embraced the values of Sikhism, said Ghuman, including service, humility and integrity. He worked hard to balance his work and his studies and ""embodied the spirit of so many young people who leave their homes in search of a brighter tomorrow,"" he said. Singh also represented the ""best"" of international students, Ghuman added, saying many such students have ""been unfairly cast in a negative light,"" with some claiming they have been scapegoated for Canada's housing troubles. In his spare time, Singh was a boxer, swimmer and aviation enthusiast who enjoyed building scale models. He also volunteered and went out of his way to support others, Ghuman said. Singh's mother and father were unable to come to Canada for Sunday's memorial due to travel and visa difficulties, Ghuman said. A crowdfunding campaign raised more than $122,000 to cover funeral and legal expenses, including transporting Singh's body back to India. Harshandeep Singh is shown in an undated handout photo. Building scene of previous shooting The building where Singh was shot had a lengthy history of health and safety violations. It was also the scene of a shooting less than a month prior, which remains under investigation. City police say a man was injured in a shooting at the apartment early Nov. 21. He was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries, EPS spokesperson Carolin Maran said in an email. Police requested the City of Edmonton review the property's business licence earlier this year, she added. A spokesperson for Alberta Occupational Health and Safety, meanwhile, confirmed it conducted an inspection of the apartment with Singh's employer on Sept. 9. No orders were issued as a result of the inspection, the agency said. jwakefield@postmedia.com x.com/jonnywakefield @jonnywakefield.bsky.social Related Hundreds attend NorQuest College vigil for international student slain on night security job Accused in Edmonton security guard killing had history of violence and gang involvement: parole board A security guard was gunned down in an Edmonton apartment building.

"Trudeau, Singh to attend former premier John Horgan's provincial state memorial",2024,"Times Colonist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh are attending today's provincial state memorial service for former premier John Horgan. Itineraries released by Trudeau and Singh's offices on Saturday confirmed their attendance at The Q Centre in Colwood. Both leaders paid tribute to B.C.'s 36th premier when he died last month. Trudeau said Horgan ""embodied kindness and courage"" while Singh called the former premier ""an incredible leader"" and a pillar of the NDP movement. Other dignitaries expected at the memorial include Lt.-Gov. Janet Austin and Premier David Eby. Horgan died at Royal Jubilee Hospital on Nov. 12 after his third bout with cancer since 2008. He served as premier from 2017 to 2022. After he resigned from his Langford-Juan de Fuca MLA seat in 2023, Horgan was appointed ambassador to Germany. In June 2024, he went on leave from his ambassadorship after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He returned to Victoria and was admitted to Royal Jubilee almost two weeks prior to his death. The service will start at 1 p.m. at The Q Centre arena at 1767 Island Hwy., and will be livestreamed. Doors will open at 11:45 a.m., and all guests must be seated by 12:45 p.m. The service is open to the public, but you must have a ticket.

NDP strikes confidence deal with Green MLAs,2024,"After almost two months of talks, the B.C. NDP has reached a deal with Green MLAs Jeremy Valeriote and Rob Botterell to support the government on confidence votes in exchange for collaboration on key priorities such as health care and environmental protection. The new accord, called the ""co-operation and responsible government accord,"" will give Premier David Eby and his government some stability after they came out of the October provincial election with only a oneseat majority. Unlike the confidence-and-supply agreement reached between the NDP and the Greens in 2017, the new deal is set to be reviewed every year - instead of a full four-year commitment - and will include public quarterly progress reports. It also doesn't require the Greens to vote with the NDP on every bill. Both parties agreed that lessons were learned over the three years of the prior agreement, which was ripped up a year early by then-Premier John Horgan with the calling of the 2020 election. ""What we struck here was a balance where we focused on key initiatives and key priorities that are deliverables in a way to keep government stable for four years,"" said Deputy Premier Niki Sharma. ""I would say all of the things in this agreement are a result of lessons from how we've worked together in the past. And I think it's an important thing to think about a way that we can work together in the future from those lessons."" Many of the specific policy points in the deal come almost directly from the NDP's 2024 election platform, including the commitments to build 30,000 non-market housing units over 10 years; prevent clawbacks on the new Canada Disability Benefit; and expand both the shelter aid for elderly renters and the rental assistance programs. Several items from the Green's platform that Valeriote and Botterell were able to negotiate into the deal include the establishment of community health centres alongside urgent and primary health centres; the expansion of public medical coverage to include psychologists; and the establishment of regional transit on Vancouver Island and along the Sea to Sky Highway. There are also provisions for a review of the NDP's marquee Clean B.C. plan in 2025 by both parties; a review of B.C. forests amid continuing challenges in the forestry sector; and potentially the permanent protection of the Fairy Creek Watershed, although there remains no timeline on when that could happen. ""The agreement draws heavily on our platform's four key areas: thriving people, resilient communities, a flourishing natural world, and healthy society and good governance,"" said Valeriote. ""The structure of the agreement is intentional from both sides. It doesn't restrict the B.C. Greens from holding government to account, but gives us an active role in delivering on specific priorities for British Columbians."" One area of potential contention included in the document surrounds the issue of proportional representation, with the Greens having long supported a shift away from the current first-past-the-post system. The stipulation that a referendum be held on proportional representation was included in the 2017 agreement. It was ultimately held in 2018 and rejected by voters. This time, the Greens have merely got the NDP to agree to forming an all-party committee to discuss the topic next year. Valeriote told reporters he hopes to keep the dream of changes to the electoral system alive.","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 15, 2024",Agreements; Provincial elections; Health facilities,,2024-12-15,The Province
"Former NDP MLA remembered for being 'smart, funny ... kind'",2024,"A former B.C. New Democrat MLA and the incoming party director, Dan Coulter, has died at the age of 49 after a brief hospitalization. His death was confirmed Friday by party president Aaron Sumexheltza and it's current director, Heather Stoutenburg. They did not indicate the cause of death. Coulter was admitted to hospital after suffering a ""serious medical emergency,"" said the party in a statement last week. ""It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the loss of Dan Coulter, a devoted advocate for the people of British Columbia, a passionate voice for inclusivity and justice, and a cherished member of the B.C. NDP family,"" said Sumexheltza and Stoutenburg. ""To those of us who knew him, Dan was so much more than a colleague - he was a friend and a mentor. He was smart, funny, thoughtful and honest. But above all things, he was kind."" Premier David Eby echoing that on social media, saying the province has lost an ""incredible advocate and a fighter for justice."" ""He was so happy to be part of a movement to make this province better for everyone,"" Eby said. ""Even at such a young age, Dan leaves behind a proud legacy of standing up for workers, the people of Chilliwack, and people across B.C."" A private service is scheduled for this Saturday, Dec. 21. A public service will be held in Chilliwack on Jan. 11. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to the Chilliwack Restorative Justice and Youth Advocacy Association, which Coulter previously served as a director of, the Chilliwack Bowls of Hope Society and the B.C. SPCA. Coulter was elected in 2020 in the riding of Chilliwack. He also served as the parliamentary secretary for accessibility and later the minister of state for infrastructure and transit. His victory was a historic breakthrough for the NDP in the Fraser Valley, with Coulter's riding a traditionally conservative stronghold that had been held by the B.C. Liberals since its formation in 2009. The riding was modified and renamed Chilliwack North for the 2024 election and Coulter was defeated by the Conser vative Heather Maahs. Before his time in provincial politics, Coulter served as a trustee for the Chilliwack school board from 2013 to 2020 and as the president of CUPE Local 3787. While working as a millwright in 1999, he was the victim of a workplace accident that left him with serious injuries that required him to use wheelchair. He is survived by his partner Rebecca and their dogs Spencer and Anna-Bella. Last week, B.C. Children's Minister Grace Lore announced she had colorectal cancer and was stepping away from her portfolio while undergoing treatment, but will participate in important votes in the legislature. A memorial service is also being held today at the Q Centre for former NDP premier John Horgan.","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 15, 2024",,,2024-12-15,The Province

"As Notley exits, Alberta NDP now Nenshi's to fumble",2024,"On Thursday a former premier of Alberta, Rachel Notley, announced ""with mixed feelings"" that she is resigning her seat in the province's legislature at the end of the month. Her feelings might well be mixed, and that's a decent description of how Alberta feels about Rachel Notley. The judgment of history will emphasize her extraordinary feat in winning an Alberta general election for the New Democrats, something that had previously been unthinkable, and establishing the party as a credible governing alternative when the province really, really needed one. If you're a United Conservative, you might be opening a bottle of champagne right now. But don't forget to thank her under your breath for providing crucial competitive pressure that forced Alberta conservatives to clean up their political act. There's bound to be speculation about what Notley will do next and why she's quitting the assembly. She'll be measured for some higher political role whether she wants to be or not. Her own success as a leader and campaigner may appear to have left her (usefully?) somewhat homeless as a politician. The Alberta New Democratic Party she was born into has been taken over by Naheed Nenshi, an egotistical politician with his own political machine, no NDP background and a relative lack of specifiable political principles. (I mean all that in a kindly way: I do not expect to hear Nenshi cry out ""Egotistical? Moi?"" when this is published.) And his marriage to the Alberta NDP has a compelling logic that everyone in the province who can't stand the Tories has accepted. But it does mean that he isn't bound to run on Notley's track record or Notley's prairie socialism. After her time in office, Notley herself didn't have much luck with this. If she takes on some new political job that requires or even indicates moral support for the current federal government, that would be seen as a surprising betrayal of the Alberta NDP (as well as the federal NDP, for whatever that might be worth), and would risk dividing the provincial party. Let's also remember that the lady is 60 years of age despite her youthful appearance and energy. She is four years senior to her successor Jason Kenney, seven to the current premier and eight to Nenshi. Nenshi has stopped talking about a potential rebranding of the NDP(A), which can for now still command the inherited loyalty of organized labour and that of the people who literally grew up alongside Notley, the crown princess who became queen, in the party. But the temptation to turn the provincial party into Nenshi's Purple Prosperity People must still be present, and such a defection would be a dreadful development for the New Democracy. I'm not the person anyone needs to hear this from, exactly, but a strong NDP (with that name) in Alberta may be more important for the future of soft democratic socialism and labour-union power than the immediate fate of the federal party. Hell, a bad 2025 federal election and a grateful-but-quickmoving-on from Jagmeet Singh is probably the best thing for the NDP, even considered purely as a party, in the long run.

New Saskatchewan Marshals Service already 'poaching'; NDP estimates that at least $14 million has been 'wasted' on planning force,2024,"As the Saskatchewan Marshals Service (SMS) aims to be up and running next summer - a year ahead of its initial mid-2026 projection - the new police force is looking to recruit from in-province agencies. In a statement issued Friday, the SMS said it ""has seen interest from all over the country, including provinces like B.C., Alberta and Manitoba and also from individuals here in Saskatchewan."" By the time the service is up and running, it anticipates there will be SMS officers drawn ""from both inside and from outside the province."" Nicole Sarauer, Opposition shadow minister for policing and public safety, said this speaks to some of the concerns raised by her party - that the money for the SMS would be better spent shoring up active police services in Saskatchewan. ""They are poaching from already existing police forces to fill their allotment of officers,"" said Sarauer. ""If we're just shuffling a group of police officers from one type of policing body to another type of policing body in Saskatchewan, it doesn't actually address the concerns that people have about crime in this province."" A home-base location for the SMS is still up in the air, as is the cost. The NDP estimated that ""at least $14 million has been wasted on planning for the service to date."" Minister of Corrections, Policing and Public Safety Tim McLeod presented a different figure in an emailed statement. ""Our government has been transparent with costs,"" said Mc-Leod. ""To date, $5.6 million has been spent in building the Saskatchewan Marshals Service."" The SMS was first announced in 2022 as a means to ""enhance law enforcement presence across the province,"" stated an SMS news release issued on Thursday afternoon. The SMS has already hired Chief Marshal Rob Cameron, Deputy Chief Marshal Rich Lowan and Civilian Deputy Chief Thomas Sierzycki, along with two superintendents and three inspectors, according to the release. ""As we continue to approach our eventual deployment in Saskatchewan, it's important to our service that we maintain these positive relationships with other enforcement agencies,"" said Cameron in the news release. ""We will continue to engage with municipal and First Nations communities and other partners so we can best serve the province."" As for a governing mandate, the SMS will focus on higher crime locations in Saskatchewan. The intention is to ""detect, disrupt and deter"" criminal activity, locate ""high-risk and prolific offenders"" as well as people with outstanding warrants, offer assistance to existing police services and conduct investigations pertaining to farming and agriculture. alsalloum@postmedia.com","Leader Post; Regina, Sask.","Regina, Sask.","Salloum, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 14, 2024",Criminal investigations; Public safety,,2024-12-14,Leader Post
Former NDP MLA Coulter dies at 49 after emergency; Premier praises incoming party director for standing up for people of Chilliwack,2024,"A former B.C. NDP MLA and the incoming party director, Dan Coulter, has died at the age of 49 after a brief hospitalization. His death was confirmed Friday by party president Aaron Sumexheltza and its current director, Heather Stoutenburg. They did not indicate the cause of death. Coulter was admitted to hospital after suffering a ""serious medical emergency,"" the party said in a statement last week. ""It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge the loss of Dan Coulter, a devoted advocate for the people of British Columbia, a passionate voice for inclusivity and justice, and a cherished member of the B.C. NDP family,"" said Sumexheltza and Stoutenburg. ""To those of us who knew him, Dan was so much more than a colleague - he was a friend and a mentor. He was smart, funny, thoughtful and honest. But above all things, he was kind."" Premier David Eby echoed that on social media, saying the province has lost an ""incredible advocate and a fighter for justice."" ""He was so happy to be part of a movement to make this province better for everyone,"" Eby said. ""Even at such a young age, Dan leaves behind a proud legacy of standing up for workers, the people of Chilliwack, and people across B.C."" A private service is scheduled for Saturday. A public service will be held in Chilliwack on Jan. 11. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to the Chilliwack Restorative Justice and Youth Advocacy Association, which Coulter previously served as a director of, the Chilliwack Bowls of Hope Society and the B.C. SPCA. Coulter was elected in 2020 to represent the riding of Chilliwack. He also served as the parliamentary secretary for accessibility and later the minister of state for infrastructure and transit. His victory was a historic breakthrough for the NDP in the Fraser Valley, with Coulter's riding a traditionally conservative stronghold that had been held by the B.C. Liberals since its formation in 2009. The riding was modified and renamed Chilliwack North for the 2024 election and Coulter was defeated by the Conservative candidate, school board trustee Heather Maahs. Before his time in provincial politics, Coulter served as a trustee for the Chilliwack school board from 2013 to 2020 and as the president of CUPE Local 3787. While working as a millwright in 1999, he was the victim of a workplace accident that left him with serious injuries that required him to use a wheelchair. He is survived by his partner Rebecca and their dogs Spencer and Anna-Bella. Last week, B.C. Children's Minister Grace Lore announced she had colorectal cancer and was stepping away from her portfolio while undergoing treatment, but will participate in important votes in the legislature. A memorial service is also being held Sunday at the Q Centre for former NDP premier John Horgan, who died on Nov. 12 after his third bout with cancer.","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Lazenby, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 14, 2024",,,2024-12-14,The Vancouver Sun
Both parties talk 'balance' as Greens agree to deal that stabilizes B.C. NDP,2024,"After almost two months of talks, the B.C. NDP have reached a deal for Green MLAs Jeremy Valeriote and Rob Botterell to support the government on confidence votes in exchange for collaboration on key priorities such as health care and environmental protection. The new deal, called the ""co-operation and responsible government accord,"" will give Premier David Eby and his government some stability after they won only a one-seat majority in the October provincial election. Unlike the confidence-and-supply agreement reached between the NDP and the Greens in 2017, the new deal is set to be reviewed every year instead of a full four-year commitment and will include public quarterly progress reports. It also doesn't require the Greens to vote with the NDP on every bill. Both parties agreed that lessons were learned over the three years of the prior agreement, which ended being ripped up a year early by then-Premier John Horgan with the calling of the 2020 election. ""What we struck here was a balance where we focused on key initiatives and key priorities that are deliverables in a way to keep government stable for four years,"" said Deputy Premier Niki Sharma. ""I would say all of the things in this agreement are a result of lessons from how we've worked together in the past. And I think it's an important thing to think about a way that we can work together in the future from those lessons."" Many of the specific policy points in the deal come almost directly from the NDP's 2024 election platform, including the commitments to build 30,000 non-market housing units over 10 years; prevent clawbacks on the new Canada Disability Benefit; and expand both the shelter aid for elderly renters and the rental assistance programs. Several items from the Green's platform that Valeriote and Botterell were able to negotiate into the deal include the establishment of community health centres alongside urgent and primary health centres; the expansion of public medical coverage to include psychologists; and the establishment of regional transit on Vancouver Island and along the Sea to Sky Highway. There are also provisions for a review of the NDP's marquee Clean B.C. plan in 2025 by both parties; a review of B.C. forests amid continuing challenges in the forestry sector; and potentially the permanent protection of the Fairy Creek Watershed, although there remains no timeline on when that could happen.

Selina Robinson tells all about her exit from the B.C. NDP,2024,"The sting of antisemitism that many Canadian Jews have been experiencing since Oct. 7, 2023, has led to this catastrophic comparison: This is what it must have felt like in 1930s Germany. This is a problematic parallel for many reasons. Chief among them is that in Nazi Germany, it was the government – and arms of government, including the police – leading and carrying out the antisemitism in the form of discriminatory laws and violence. Here, today, the threat is not coming from those in charge. But what kind of support are they offering? Many in the Canadian Jewish community would say: not enough. A reading of Truth Be Told, a new book by former B.C. cabinet minister Selina Robinson, will not offer much comfort in that regard. Ms. Robinson, who is Jewish, lost her seat in cabinet in February after an ugly comment made during a B’nai Brith webinar. Lamenting a lack of knowledge about Jewish history, she said that Israel had been founded on “a crappy piece of land with nothing on it.” She quickly corrected herself and afterward apologized multiple times, acknowledging her error, but it didn’t matter. There were, in fact, many people on that land – especially Arabs, who would certainly not call it “crappy,” but rather, home. A few days later, Ms. Robinson lost her job as minister of postsecondary education. A month later, she quit the party’s caucus, alleging, in a damning open letter, that it had an antisemitism problem. In her self-published book, Ms. Robinson gives her take on what went on behind the scenes, describing what she experienced as a betrayal by many of her NDP colleagues, especially Premier David Eby. When she texted him an apology for her webinar gaffe, he replied: “Happens to the best. Hang in there,” she discloses. A few days later, as the anger over what she said continued, he told her he could not “see a way forward.” Truth Be Told, dedicated to the late former premier John Horgan, portrays Mr. Eby as being less concerned about doing the right thing and more focused on what Ms. Robinson describes as the mob demanding her resignation. This mob, she says, was after her long before she made those comments. “I maintain that what happened is not because of what I said, but because of who I am. And this is not something I can change.” I have gotten to know Ms. Robinson because of her advocacy for Holocaust education; she reached out to me to discuss the issue in the spring of 2023, and we have stayed in touch. She recently sent me an advance copy of her book, which goes on sale Dec. 18. She describes returning to the legislature and feeling abandoned by her colleagues, as protests raged outside her new, non-ministerial office. In this low period, she had an idea: to bring Jews and Muslims together for dialogues. Ms. Robinson pitched her project to the Premier’s then-chief of staff. Buoyed, she made calls to the Jewish and Muslim communities. Two weeks later, she writes, the Premier’s office declared it “too political.” A month after she lost her cabinet position, after not hearing from Mr. Eby that whole time, she writes, he asked for a meeting. Maybe, she thought, he had reconsidered her dialogue project. Instead, she writes, he asked if she knew that her constituency executive was planning to write a letter to the party expressing discontent with her treatment. Mr. Eby asked for her thoughts about him reaching out to them, to encourage them not to write the letter, she says. Immediately after that meeting, she resigned. There are other allegations – that Mr. Eby went months after her cancer diagnosis without asking her how she was doing; a dispute they had over hedgetrimming at UBC; a phone call where he hung up on her. But what rankles her is the lack of caring about the antisemitism she was experiencing. While she doesn’t think most of her former NDP colleagues are antisemitic, she writes, “I can be 100-per-cent certain, however, that I can count on one hand the number of my former colleagues who are anti-antisemitic.” That is a chilling thing for any Canadian Jew to read. It should be a chilling thing for any Canadian, in fact. If someone so deeply involved with and beloved by a political party and government can feel this way, where does that leave the rest of us? During an editorial board meeting at The Globe and Mail before the B.C. fall election, I asked Mr. Eby about Ms. Robinson. “I think it’s awful that Selina didn’t feel that she was able to stay in our caucus,” he said. “I reflect on that, what I could have done better, what I could have done differently.” He called her an important voice, said her loss was significant, and said he was committed to fighting hate “in all forms.” I choose to take some comfort in that.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Lederman, Marsha",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 14, 2024",Antisemitism; Jewish people,,2024-12-14,The Globe and Mail
"BC Greens agree to support NDP, bolstering its razor-thin majority",2024,"For the second time in seven years, the BC Green Party has agreed to support an NDP government, signing a confidence pact with binding promises on policies and greater oversight of provincial legislation. The two parties announced the four-year agreement Friday, touting the major policies they agreed upon that dedicate more than $200-million in spending – but with the understanding that this deal will be renewed annually by both parties. The agreement bolsters the NDP’s razor-thin majority after the October election. The NDP holds 47 seats to the BC Conservatives’ 44 and the Greens have two. It lists a raft of policies the parties see as “deliverables” next year, including: opening community health centres to improve primary care access; a $50-million annual plan to subsidize people buying heat pumps for their homes; protecting, buying or building 30,000 units of non-market housing starting with a quarter being secured next year; spending $50-million to expand public coverage of visits to psychologists; and creating new bus routes along three major highways. The Greens will vote with the NDP in support of all these policies and also be privy to detailed briefings as the government crafts and delivers its budgets. Niki Sharma, Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, told reporters in Vancouver Friday that in order to reach this new pact, both parties had to have frank discussions about what went right and wrong with the previous deal, which former NDP premier John Horgan prematurely tore up in 2020 to call a snap election. In that vote, the New Democrats gained a solid majority and the Greens lost one of their three seats. “I know that we’ll have differences of opinions moving forward, but the fact that we can show a pathway where two political parties – in a time of great polarization – can come together for British Columbians is a profound thing,” she said. Jeremy Valeriote, a rookie Green MLA for the riding of West Vancouver–Sea to Sky, said at a separate news conference in Victoria that his party pushed hard for the annual renewal of the agreement in negotiations over the past two months as a way to hold the NDP accountable. He also noted that the Greens secured the commitment of public quarterly progress reports on the 18 policies identified in the pact. The Greens regarded Mr. Horgan’s snap election call four years ago as a betrayal. “We did take a lot of those lessons and put them into this discussion,” said Mr. Valeriote. The Greens maintain that they will continue to vote independently on areas not mentioned in the deal where the two parties clash, such as the New Democrats’ support for certain LNG export projects or its pledge to expand the use of involuntary care for people battling mental illness, addictions and problems with aggression. BC Conservative Leader John Rustad said on election night in October that his party would try to bring down the New Democrats as soon as possible. He doesn’t see the agreement doing much in terms of stabilizing the current government when the legislature sits again in the new year. “The difference between 47 [NDP MLAs] plus two Greens without a deal versus 47 plus two Greens with the deal is irrelevant: I don’t think there was a chance that the Greens were going to be eager to take down the NDP,” he told The Globe and Mail in a phone interview Friday. Still, the agreement does make the mechanics of governing easier for the NDP, since they won’t have to ensure every single member is in the legislature on the days they want to pass new laws. It is pressure that wears on bare majority governments, according to Stewart Prest, a political-science lecturer at the University of B.C. And, he said, it also allows the NDP to sidestep the controversy of the Speaker of the House, NDP MLA Raj Chouhan, repeatedly breaking ties to vote in favour of legislation, which is atypical. The Greens, meanwhile, have secured progress on many important priorities while making the agreement “as politically painful as possible for the NDP to walk away from,” Dr. Prest said Friday.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Hager, Mike",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 14, 2024",Agreements; Public policy; Provincial government; Political parties,Nom: Green Party-British Columbia Canada; NAICS: 813940; Nom: New Democratic Party-British Columbia Canada; NAICS: 813940,2024-12-14,The Globe and Mail

"Colby Cosh: As Notley exits, Alberta NDP now Nenshi's party to fumble",2024,"On Thursday a former premier of Alberta, Rachel Notley, announced ""with mixed feelings"" that she is resigning her seat in the province's legislature at the end of the month. Her feelings might well be mixed, and that's a decent description of how Alberta feels about Rachel Notley. The judgment of history will emphasize her extraordinary feat in winning an Alberta general election for the New Democrats, something that had previously been unthinkable, and establishing the party as a credible governing alternative when the province really, really needed one. If you're a United Conservative, you might be opening a bottle of champagne right now. But don't forget to thank her under your breath for providing crucial competitive pressure that forced Alberta conservatives to clean up their political act. There's bound to be speculation about what Notley will do next and why she's quitting the assembly. She'll be measured for some higher political role whether she wants to be or not. Her own success as a leader and campaigner may appear to have left her (usefully?) somewhat homeless as a politician. The Alberta New Democratic Party she was born into has been taken over by Naheed Nenshi, an egotistical politician with his own political machine, no NDP background and a relative lack of specifiable political principles. (I mean all that in a kindly way: I do not expect to hear Nenshi cry out ""Egotistical? Moi?"" when this is published.) And his marriage to the Alberta NDP has a compelling logic that everyone in the province who can't stand the Tories has accepted. But it does mean that he isn't bound to run on Notley's track record or Notley's prairie socialism. After her time in office, Notley herself didn't have much luck with this. If she takes on some new political job that requires or even indicates moral support for the current federal government, that would be seen as a surprising betrayal of the Alberta NDP (as well as the federal NDP, for whatever that might be worth), and would risk dividing the provincial party. Let's also remember that the lady is 60 years of age despite her youthful appearance and energy. She is four years senior to her successor Jason Kenney, seven to the current premier and eight to Nenshi. Nenshi has stopped talking about a potential re-branding of the NDP(A), which can for now still command the inherited loyalty of organized labour and that of the people who literally grew up alongside Notley, the crown princess who became queen, in the party. But the temptation to turn the provincial party into Nenshi's Purple Prosperity People must still be present, and such a defection would be a dreadful development for the New Democracy. I'm not the person anyone needs to hear this from, exactly, but a strong NDP (with that name) in Alberta may be more important for the future of soft democratic socialism and labour-union power than the immediate fate of the federal party. Hell, a bad 2025 federal election and a grateful-but-quick-moving-on from Jagmeet Singh is probably the best thing for the NDP, even considered purely as a party, in the long run.

Notley to step down as NDP MLA; Ex-premier says it has been an honour to serve Edmonton-Strathcona riding,2024,"EDMONTON Former premier Rachel Notley, NDP MLA for Edmonton-Strathcona, has announced she will be stepping down. Notley posted on Facebook thanking her constituents, staff, family and caucus members. She said it has been an ""indescribable"" honour to represent those in her community for nearly 17 years. An NDP staffmember told Postmedia that Notley's resignation will be effective Dec. 30. At a news conference on Monday, Notley said she will announce her plans in the coming weeks - which will not include municipal or federal politics, which she had previously ruled out. In January, Notley announced that she would be stepping down as leader of the Alberta NDP, making room for Naheed Nenshi, who was elected leader in June. She said part of her reason for staying months after losing the election was to help guide the 19 new MLAs who were elected. She was first elected in 2008 and became leader of the Alberta NDP in 2014. The following year, she became the 17th premier following the NDP's unexpected win in the 2015 election. As leader of the government, she increased corporate income taxes to 12 per cent from 10 per cent, increased the minimum wage to $15 per hour and placed a consumer carbon tax on fuel while also aiming to phase out coal plants. When asked if she could pick a highlight of her time in the legislature, she said it was difficult to decide what was most rewarding. While she would've liked to depart the legislature as premier, she reflected on the growth her caucus has had over nearly two decades. ""With our leadership race and our new leader, we've generated so much enthusiasm in terms of our membership and our activism, and so I'm proud that Alberta is not a one-party province,"" Notley said. Notley's resignation triggers a byelection, and the timing will be up to Premier Danielle Smith. It will also make room for Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi to run for the Edmonton-Strathcona seat. He previously told Postmedia he would be looking to run for a seat in either Edmonton or Calgary. When Smith was asked if she'd call a byelection in time for Nenshi to join the spring session, she said they would have to ""wait and see,"" noting Nenshi chose not to run in the Lethbridge byelection on Dec. 18. When asked about her thoughts on Nenshi potentially running in her riding, she said she would leave it up to him to decide what he wants to do but said two NDP leaders have previously run in the riding. In a post on Instagram, Nenshi called Notley a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" politician and thanked her for her guidance during his first legislative session. ""She grew our movement into government and now the largest Opposition in the history of Alberta and for that we are deeply grateful,"" Nenshi said. The NDP said Nenshi will not be commenting further and will be hosting a YouTube Live event on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. where he will be answering questions.

"Opposition charges NDP has 'conveniently' withheld financial results, sparking fears t hat B.C. deficit has skyrocketed",2024,"Opposition MLAs say the NDP are 12 days late and counting in filing their quarterly financial outlook. The delay is fuelling speculation over the reason - is it simple administrative delay or is it hiding a deficit ballooning higher than the $8.9 billion figure revealed in September? B.C.'s finance minister Brenda Bailey and her ministry say that despite the delay, the government is within the extended timeline allowed in an election year. These questions come as Premier David Eby is telling the business community he wants a ""reset"" of their relationship with the provincial government. At a B.C. Chamber of Commerce lunch on Tuesday, the premier said he plans to reduce the provincial deficit, boost economic development and freeze hiring in the public service. ""There is currently a hiring freeze in the public sector. Not in the front-line services, like health care, education ... but in the administration,"" Eby told business leaders. Eby didn't elaborate when asked about the freeze on Thursday, but said government will also be conducting a review of administrative costs in health care. He also said he understands the challenges faced by British Columbians because of poor economic conditions, which in turn reflects on the provincial budget. ""Our budget is under huge pressure. We're at the bottom of the economic cycle right now. Resource prices are low. The decision of people whether or not to buy a home has been constrained by high interest rates,"" explained Eby. ""People are feeling those high interest rates in other ways as well. They've got less money to spend. They're going to restaurants less. ... The same pressure that families are feeling in their budgets, we are seeing that in government budgets as well."" As for when the fiscal update could be released, Bailey said more information will be provided next week. Peter Milobar, the official Opposition's finance critic, argued that by law the NDP were required to provide the financial update, which will be the second since February's budget, by Nov. 30. He said it is now the middle of December and there is no word on when the report is coming. ""The same week that the premier is telling the business community that he wants to reset the relationship, they've conveniently withheld the second quarter results,"" he said. ""I think they would have been very interested to know ahead of that luncheon on the 10th, just what the state of books are in British Columbia, as he's flinging out previously undisclosed hiring freezes and things of that nature."" The ministry said that under provincial law, the government doesn't have to meet the Nov. 30 deadline in a year with a fall election, but has 90 day deadline that started after final election results were in. Still, Milobar said, the failure to give the public a look at the government's books is part of a trend of not taking the necessary steps after an election, such as releasing mandate letters for new ministers and calling the legislature into session to take immediate action on voter priorities. He said the government has shrugged off those responsibilities until the new year as it negotiates with the Greens. ""Everyone in the province is being held up, not knowing what the work of a minister is supposed to be, what the priority is supposed to be, what the priority of the government is. ... The actual nitty gritty detail that comes in those mandate letters, and what's the fiscal situation? We don't know any of that."" The B.C. Chamber of Commerce CEO, Fiona Famulak, isn't as concerned as Milobar about the delayed update but said timely and transparent reporting is important to monitor progress and that any increase of the deficit would be a concern. As for the ""reset"" of the relationship with the NDP, Famulak said she plans to push the government to fulfill its promises. ""The proof will be in the pudding and we look forward to seeing the actions taken and the results delivered, and will hold the government's feet to the fire so that the economy is prioritized, such that private sector job growth increases, our natural resources are unlocked to create the economic opportunities that they can and that economic opportunity benefits British Columbians of all generations.""

"BC Greens agree to support NDP, bolstering the government’s razor-thin majority:   The two parties announced the four-year agreement touting the major policies they agreed upon that dedicate more than $200-million in spending",2024,"For the second time in seven years, the BC Green Party has agreed to support a minority NDP government, signing a confidence pact with binding promises on policies and greater oversight of provincial legislation. The two parties announced the four-year agreement Friday, touting the major policies they agreed upon that dedicate more than $200-million in spending – but with the understanding that this deal will be renewed annually by both parties. The agreement bolsters the NDP’s razor-thin majority after the October election. The NDP holds 47 seats to the BC Conservatives’ 44 and the Greens have two. It lists a raft of policies the parties see as “deliverables” next year, including: opening community health centres to improve primary care access; a $50-million annual plan to subsidize people buying heat pumps for their homes; protecting, buying or building 30,000 units of non-market housing starting with a quarter being secured next year; spending $50-million to expand public coverage of visits to psychologists; and creating new bus routes along three major highways. The Greens will vote with the NDP in support of all these policies and also be privy to detailed briefings as the government crafts and delivers its budgets. Niki Sharma, Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, told reporters in Vancouver Friday that in order to reach this new pact, both parties had to have frank discussions about what went right and wrong with the previous deal, which former NDP premier John Horgan prematurely tore up in 2020 to call a snap election. In that vote, the New Democrats gained a solid majority and the Greens lost one of their three seats. “I know that we’ll have differences of opinions moving forward, but the fact that we can show a pathway where two political parties – in a time of great polarization – can come together for British Columbians is a profound thing,” she said. Jeremy Valeriote, a rookie Green MLA for the riding of West Vancouver–Sea to Sky, said at a separate news conference in Victoria that his party pushed hard for the annual renewal of the agreement in negotiations over the past two months as a way to hold the NDP accountable. He also noted that the Greens secured the commitment of public quarterly progress reports on the 18 policies identified in the pact. The Greens regarded Mr. Horgan’s snap election call four years ago as a betrayal. “We did take a lot of those lessons and put them into this discussion,” said Mr. Valeriote. The Greens maintain that they will continue to vote independently on areas not mentioned in the deal where the two parties clash, such as the New Democrats’ support for certain LNG export projects or its pledge to expand the use of involuntary care for people battling mental illness, addictions and problems with aggression. BC Conservative Leader John Rustad said on election night in October that his party would try to bring down the New Democrats as soon as possible. He doesn’t see the agreement doing much in terms of stabilizing the current government when the legislature sits again in the new year. “The difference between 47 [NDP MLAs] plus two Greens without a deal versus 47 plus two Greens with the deal is irrelevant: I don’t think there was a chance that The Greens were going to be eager to take down the NDP,” he told The Globe and Mail in a phone interview Friday. Still, the agreement does make the mechanics of governing easier for the NDP, since they won’t have to ensure every single member is in the legislature on the days they want to pass new laws. It is pressure that wears on bare majority governments, according to Stewart Prest, a political-science lecturer at the University of B.C. And, he said, it also allows the NDP to sidestep the controversy of the Speaker of the House, NDP MLA Raj Chouhan, repeatedly breaking ties to vote in favour of legislation, which is atypical. The Greens, meanwhile, have secured progress on many important priorities while making the agreement “as politically painful as possible for the NDP to walk away from,” Dr. Prest said Friday.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Hager, Mike",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 13, 2024",,,2024-12-13,The Globe and Mail
"Selina Robinson’s new book is a tell-all about her exit from the BC NDP:   The former cabinet minister maintains that she was removed from her role not for her words, but who she is",2024,"The sting of antisemitism that many Canadian Jews have been experiencing since Oct. 7, 2023, has led to this catastrophic comparison: This is what it must have felt like in 1930s Germany . This is a problematic parallel for many reasons. Chief among them is that in Nazi Germany, it was the government – and arms of government, including the police – leading and carrying out the antisemitism in the form of discriminatory laws and violence. Here, today, the threat is not coming from those in charge. But what kind of support are they offering? Many in the Canadian Jewish community would say: not enough. A reading of Truth Be Told , a new book by former B.C. cabinet minister Selina Robinson, will not offer much comfort in that regard. Ms. Robinson, who is Jewish, lost her seat in cabinet in February after an ugly comment made during a B’nai Brith webinar. Lamenting a lack of knowledge about Jewish history, she said that Israel had been founded on “a crappy piece of land with nothing on it.” She quickly corrected herself and afterward apologized multiple times, acknowledging her error, but it didn’t matter. There were, in fact, many people on that land – especially Arabs, who would certainly not call it “crappy,” but rather, home. A few days later, Ms. Robinson lost her job as minister of post-secondary education. A month later, she quit the party’s caucus, alleging, in a damning open letter, that it had an antisemitism problem. In her self-published book, Ms. Robinson gives her take on what went on behind the scenes, describing what she experienced as a betrayal by many of her NDP colleagues, especially Premier David Eby. When she texted him an apology for her webinar gaffe, he replied: “Happens to the best. Hang in there,” she discloses. A few days later, as the anger over what she said continued, he told her he could not “see a way forward.” Truth Be Told , dedicated to the late former premier John Horgan, portrays Mr. Eby as being less concerned about doing the right thing and more focused on what Ms. Robinson describes as the mob demanding her resignation. This mob, she says, was after her long before she made those comments. “I maintain that what happened is not because of what I said, but because of who I am. And this is not something I can change.” I have gotten to know Ms. Robinson because of her advocacy for Holocaust education; she reached out to me to discuss the issue in the spring of 2023, and we have stayed in touch. She recently sent me an advance copy of her book, which goes on sale Dec. 18. She describes returning to the legislature and feeling abandoned by her colleagues, as protests raged outside her new, non-ministerial office. In this low period, she had an idea: to bring Jews and Muslims together for dialogues. Ms. Robinson pitched her project to the Premier’s then-chief of staff. Buoyed, she made calls to the Jewish and Muslim communities. Two weeks later, she writes, the Premier’s office declared it “too political.” A month after she lost her cabinet position, after not hearing from Mr. Eby that whole time, she writes, he asked for a meeting. Maybe, she thought, he had reconsidered her dialogue project. Instead, she writes, he asked if she knew that her constituency executive was planning to write a letter to the party expressing discontent with her treatment. Mr. Eby asked for her thoughts about him reaching out to them, to encourage them not to write the letter, she says. Immediately after that meeting, she resigned. There are other allegations – that Mr. Eby went months after her cancer diagnosis without asking her how she was doing; a dispute they had over hedge-trimming at UBC; a phone call where he hung up on her. But what rankles her is the lack of caring about the antisemitism she was experiencing. While she doesn’t think most of her former NDP colleagues are antisemitic, she writes, “I can be 100-per-cent certain, however, that I can count on one hand the number of my former colleagues who are anti -antisemitic.” That is a chilling thing for any Canadian Jew to read. It should be a chilling thing for any Canadian, in fact. If someone so deeply involved with and beloved by a political party and government can feel this way, where does that leave the rest of us? During an editorial board meeting at The Globe and Mail before the B.C. fall election, I asked Mr. Eby about Ms. Robinson. “I think it’s awful that Selina didn’t feel that she was able to stay in our caucus,” he said. “I reflect on that, what I could have done better, what I could have done differently.” He called her an important voice, said her loss was significant, and said he was committed to fighting hate “in all forms.” I choose to take some comfort in that.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Lederman, Marsha",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 13, 2024",Antisemitism; Jewish people,,2024-12-13,The Globe and Mail

She is an advocate of the New Democrats'plan to remove the GST off daily essentials such as children's clothing and monthly bills, like home heating, internet and cell phone bills. ""It's an honour to run for the NDP,"" Verrelli said. ""Northern Ontarians are struggling right now. All families are finding it hard to keep up. The Liberals in Northern Ontario have disappointed people - they let corporate greed drive up prices, then pushed back again and again against NDP plans to deliver relief, agreeing to half-measures like the winter tax holiday instead of permanently taking GST off essentials.

Witness recalls night Edmonton security guard Harshandeep Singh gunned down,2024,"Tammi Comeau won't soon forget the night Harshandeep Singh was slain in her apartment building. The 20-year-old international student from India, just three days on his new job as a security guard, died in the stairwell at 10603 107 Ave. early in the morning of Dec. 6. Comeau was just drifting off to sleep when a shot shattered the quiet. ""That was a gunshot,"" her son told her. Alarmed, Comeau and her son hit the floor and Comeau dialled a neighbour. No answer - she was out on a smoke break. ""I was freaking,"" Comeau recalled. She dialed 911. ""I think I heard a gunshot. My son said it was a gunshot,"" she told the police. ""Did anybody else call?"" Suspecting it might be nothing, she told the operator she didn't want to waste their time. Then she went looking up and down the hallway. Nothing. She hadn't heard any running. Then a neighbour down the hall asked if her husband was home and if he could help. ""She says, 'The security guard's laying there on the floor downstairs,'"" Comeau recalled. ""I called 911 back again, and I got on the phone with them,"" she said. The paramedics came, and she watched as they worked to save Singh. ""Even before the video went viral, I knew he shot him in the back, I saw the entry wound,"" she said, referring to a surveillance video from the stairwell that was posted on social media over the weekend. ""His cellphone was still in his hand,"" she said. As she returned to her apartment, she saw stickers on him for the defibrillator. The following day, police arrested Evan Rain, 30, of no fixed address, and Judith Saulteaux, 30, charging each with first-degree murder and possessing a prohibited weapon. Neither lived in the building where Singh was shot. Rain was specifically not allowed in the 36-unit building, Comeau said. But that didn't stop him from staying there, she said. ""He just stays at people's houses and just kind of takes over,"" she said. Rain told her son that he was in a biker gang. Looking for a new home The building has 33 two-bedroom units and three three-bedroom units on three floors. Comeau moved in during the summer, brought to Edmonton by her husband's work in the construction industry and to the apartment by its affordable rent and proximity to schools and services. Quickly she found that there were people who were persona non grata - but that didn't stop them from terrorizing residents - including one armed with a machete who threatened her if she didn't let him in. ""When I was going into the front door, I said, 'I'm going to get kicked out if I let anybody in.' ""He said, 'Go ahead and try to stop me.' And he pulled out his machete."" There were other issues with the apartment, namely cockroaches. And the air conditioning didn't work, Comeau said. The family is looking for a new place to call home. But memories of the night Singh died just down the stairs from her apartment haunt her. ""I think I got a little bit of PTSD. Once in a while, if I hear a big bang or something, I jump,"" she said. ""I never realized what that was all about,"" she said. ""You can't control your own body."" First responders plan tribute The Alberta First Responders Association (AFRA) is making plans to make sure Singh isn't forgotten. On the job just a few days before being killed while making rounds at the property, he was on thefront lines as a security guard and so is considered a first responder, said AFRA president Jerry Galliford. ""While security members aren't 'sworn' members, they are on the front lines, they do respond to calls for service, and they absolutely put themselves in harm's way to keep their territory safe,"" he said. ""Who is and who isn't a first responder can be a hot topic. But by definition, if you are the first on scene, you are one,"" Galliford told Postmedia. ""I've been working with the family and employer to ensure we can honour and celebrate the life of young Hashandeep Singh properly as a first responder who was killed in the line of duty. We are organizing an honour guard that will be represented by many different agencies, such as corrections, sheriffs, policing, EMS, and many more,"" he said. ""I expect a large showing of uniformed members from across the province. As well, I have received many messages from across the country from security and law enforcement personnel who wish they could be present for the service and wish us well for our efforts to bring this honour to Singh."" The AFRA tribute is set for Sunday, Dec. 15, at noon at the Edmonton Crematorium and Funeral Home, 6403 Roper Rd. NW. GoFundMe hits $122,000 A GoFundMe account set up for Singh's family by Gulzar Singh Nirman had exceeded $122,000 Tuesday evening. ""This senseless act of violence has left his family, friends, and loved ones shattered and struggling to cope with this devastating loss,"" Nirman wrote. ""His untimely death has left an unimaginable void in their lives, both emotionally and financially."" The funds will help cover the costs of sending Singh's body back to India and assist with funeral expenses, legal costs and other unforeseen financial challenges. ""Harshandeep's story is a heartbreaking reminder of how precious and fragile life is. As a community, we have the opportunity to come together and support his family in their time of need,"" Nirman wrote. ""Let us honour his memory by standing united and providing his family with the support they need to heal.

NDP fumbled what could be good news in health care,2024,"If health officials are being directed by the provincial government to cut bureaucratic spending by eight per cent and redirect that money to front-line care, that would probably be a good thing. The problem with cost-cutting exercises such as this, though, is the official edict from the government is not always what occurs on the front lines of health care. Manitoba Nurses Union president Darlene Jackson said this week nurses have been told cost-cutting measures from the NDP government are on the way that could affect staffing levels, including nurse-to-patient ratios. The government has confirmed there’s a plan to tighten the purse strings but says cuts will come solely from the bureaucracy. It said the directive is for Shared Health to chop eight per cent from its bureaucratic spending and redirect that money to clinical services. That would not necessarily be a bad thing, especially if it’s applied across the board, not only to Shared Health (which runs or oversees much of the health system) but to all the regional health authorities in Manitoba, including the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. Shared Health follows the Canadian Institute of Health Information guidelines to calculate administrative costs. It’s broken down into three categories: corporate, patient care-related and human resources and recruitment. That applies to Shared Health, the province’s five regional health authorities and CancerCare Manitoba. The administrative costs for those entities in 2023-24 was $307.6 million, as per Shared Health’s 2023-24 annual report. That is 4.79 per cent of total operating costs, Shared Health reports. If Shared Health, all regional health authorities and CancerCare cut their administrative costs by eight per cent, that would free up $24.6 million for front-line services. It sounds like a decent plan on paper. It would be consistent with what the NDP promised voters during last year’s election — to redirect bureaucratic spending to front-line care, including hiring more doctors, nurses and other staff. Administrative costs in health care have grown significantly in recent years. They’re up a staggering 41 per cent over the past five years, to $307.6 million in 2023-24 from $218.5 million in 2019-20. As a percentage of total operating costs, administrative spending has not increased much. It was 4.3 per cent in 2019-20 and grew slightly to 4.79 per cent in 2023-24. Still, it is an increase, and the total dollar value is excessive. So an order from the government to scale that back and redirect those resources to front-line care would seem prudent. But is that what’s truly happening? It’s unclear. The nurses union says it’s hearing a different story on the front lines. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether the government says, ‘This has to come from bureaucracy,’” president Jackson said. “The message has sort of filtered down from the executive team in the region to nurses through directors, through managers, that there is definitely a look at how savings can be achieved.” If what the government is saying is true, that it’s limiting spending cuts to the bureaucracy, it would be different than the type of cuts implemented by the former Progressive Conservative government. The Tories under former premier Brian Pallister ordered widespread operating cuts to regional health authorities, which filtered down into many areas of health delivery and resulted in staffing cuts. So the question becomes: what specifically is the new spending-cut directive and how will it be implemented? If what the union says is true, the edict is either broader than what the NDP government admits, or regional health authorities are not following orders properly. This presents a significant political problem for the NDP. No matter what the truth is behind the proposed spending cuts, the narrative will be that the NDP is cutting health care, just like the Tories did. This could have been managed better, starting with how the information was made public. The government should have made an official announcement that it was directing the health-care system to reduce administrative costs. It should have done so with representatives from Shared Health and the WRHA, and announced specifically how the edict would be carried out. It’s important to take control of the message when implementing spending cuts of any kind. Instead, the NDP issued a directive internally and allowed others, including the nurses union, to set the narrative. It’s another rookie mistake by a new government. Either way, the NDP government will have some explaining to do in the coming weeks and months, especially when hospitals start filling up with respiratory-illness cases this winter, and more patients admitted to hospital wait days in emergency departments. New information was released Tuesday by Doctors Manitoba that warned that widespread ER closures in rural and northern Manitoba will severely affect patient care over the holidays. The political errors are starting to pile up for this government. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 11, 2024",Workforce planning; Cost control; Bureaucracy; Nurses; Operating costs,Nom: Shared Health; NAICS: 516210,2024-12-11,Winnipeg Free Press
NDP calling for $50K fine against former Sask. Party MLA for conflict of interest breach,2024,"The Opposition has proposed a $50,000 penalty against former Sask. Party MLA Gary Grewal as a way to strengthen conflict of interest laws and punishments for breaches. NDP shadow minister for ethics and democracy Meara Conway argues the laws and consequences should apply to both former and current MLAs. ""We were given legal advice that the current Members' Conflict of Interest Act has a gap in that it prevents bringing penalties forward against former MLAs,"" Conway told media at the legislative building on Monday, adding that it effectively allows them to ""sail away into the sunset"" should they be found in breach of the act, so long as they don't run again. ""It's ridiculous."" In October, the conflict of interest commissioner ruled that Grewal had breached the act twice when it came to light that two hotels with which he was affiliated or owned entered into contracts with the Ministry of Social Services. Grewal announced in February that he did not intend to seek re-election this year (the provincial vote took place Oct. 28). Conway said the NDP's call for a fine came about through consultation with legal counsel, adding that Grewal ""profiteered"" to the tune of over $731,000 ""in public money."" She said counsel considered fines from elsewhere in Canada to land on the $50,000 figure. The NDP has asked for the government to work with the Opposition to strengthen the act and other laws governing the conduct of MLAs. As it stands, the Sask. Party government has shown no indication that it would consider imposing any penalty on Grewal. Premier Scott Moe and Minister of Social Services Terry Jensen both said last week that since he is a former MLA, it would not be appropriate to hand down punishment, nor is there precedence to do so. ""When was the last time that a private citizen was summoned or subpoenaed by the legislature? I don't know that that's ever happened,"" Moe said Thursday regarding the NDP's failed emergency motion to have Grewal appear before the legislative assembly and answer questions about the hotel controversy. On Monday, Moe committed to a review of the act over the next year but made no specific comment regarding fines against former MLAs. Related Former Sask.

Little progress on hospital wait times after year of NDP,2024,"The good news is hospital emergency-room and urgent-care wait times in Winnipeg are down slightly, exactly one year after the NDP won last year’s provincial election. The bad news is wait times have grown at three of the city’s six hospitals during that time. The NDP pledged during 2023 election campaign to reduce ER wait times by adding more staff and beds to the system. One year later, wait times have dropped a bit, but not much. The median wait for Winnipeg’s three ERs and three urgent care centres was 3.52 hours in October 2023, the month the NDP was sworn into office. That dropped marginally to 3.43 hours in October of this year. It’s not much of an improvement. The median wait time is the point at which half of patients had shorter wait times and half had longer ones. The biggest improvement during the NDP’s first year in office was at Concordia Hospital’s urgent-care centre, where the median wait time dropped from 4.4 hours to 3.63 hours. It’s still far too long and much longer than it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is an improvement. The ER wait time at Health Sciences Centre is also down slightly from 3.66 hours to 3.53 hours over the past year, while Seven Oaks urgent care saw a slight decline from 3.97 hours to 3.63 hours. However, wait times at Winnipeg’s three other hospitals have grown since October 2023. The longest ER wait times continue to be at St. Boniface Hospital, where the median wait time has grown to a staggering 6.2 hours from 5.45 hours in October 2023. The bottleneck at St. B’s ER is a serious problem that should be drawing the attention of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and the provincial government. It’s a disaster; half of people arriving at the ER are waiting more than six hours to see a doctor. The longest wait time for nine of 10 ER patients (called the 90th percentile wait time) was 13.9 hours at the facility, up slightly from 13.6 hours in October 2023. It’s not that more people are showing up at the ER for care. In fact, the total number of St. Boniface ER visits fell almost every year — from 46,920 in 2019-20 to 39,405 in 2023-24 — according to the WRHA’s latest annual report. Even the number of patients sick enough to be admitted to hospital dropped during that period from 9,715 to 8,928. What did grow dramatically is the number of people who arrived at the St. Boniface ER but left without being seen by a doctor. That has more than doubled from 3,130 in 2019-20 to 7,025 in 2023-24. It’s unclear why ER wait times at St. Boniface have grown so much, considering patient volumes are down. The number of staffed beds at the hospital is unchanged at 464 over the past three years. However, bed occupancy has hit its highest point in five years at 94.4 per cent. It could be the hospital is seeing more acutely ill patients and/or is treating more long-term patients who should be cared for in a non-hospital setting. It may also be due to staffing shortages. Either way, this should be examined a lot more closely. A 6.2-hour median wait time is unacceptable. Grace Hospital is another problem facility. Its ER wait time is largely unchanged from a year ago at 5.67 hours (it was 5.6 hours in October 2023). Despite an announcement earlier this year by the NDP government to fund more beds at the facility, there has been no improvement in ER wait times there. And much like St. Boniface Hospital, ER visits at Grace are down over the past five years, as are the number of admitted patients. Overall, the number of ER and urgent-care visits at Winnipeg hospitals (excluding Health Sciences Centre, which reports its numbers separately through Shared Health) is down compared with pre-pandemic volumes (180,108 in 2023-24 versus 199,066 in 2019-20), as are the number of admitted patients (19,240 in 2023-24 compared to 21,925 in 2019-20). HSC has seen its ER visits decline from 118,590 in 2019-20 to 103,997 in 2023-24, while its staffed bed count increased only marginally from 773 to 781 during that period. Whatever the case, ER and urgent-care wait times at Winnipeg hospitals are still far too long and much longer than they were pre-pandemic. No one said a new government could fix this problem overnight. But so far, after a year in office, the NDP has made little progress. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 9, 2024",Health sciences; Pandemics,,2024-12-09,Winnipeg Free Press

Sask. Party protects former MLA; NDP want Grewal to face questions about breaching conflict rules,2024,"Former Sask. Party MLA Gary Grewal will not be made to appear before the legislative assembly to answer questions about breaching the Conflict of Interest Act. On Thursday, the NDP Opposition introduced two emergency motions, one of which called on Grewal to appear before the committee of the whole assembly ""to answer questions about the Ministry of Social Services's hotel policies and the conflict of interest commissioner's opinion of Oct. 21, 2024."" That opinion from Conflict of Interest Commissioner (COIC) Maurice Herauf found that Grewal breached the act twice while he was sitting as a Sask. Party MLA. Grewal became the focus of two COIC investigations once it came to light that a pair of hotels with which he was affiliated or owned had entered into contracts with the Ministry of Social Services. Specifically, the Sunrise and Thriftlodge motels saw a surge in government contracts after Grewal's 2020 election. Over those four years, the motels linked to Grewal received $731,000 from the ministry. Speaking after question period, Premier Scott Moe said ""you don't see Mr. Grewal here,"" in response to questions about a penalty. When pressed on the message it sends if the former MLA faces no consequences, Moe responded: ""Historically, has that ever occurred? Not to my knowledge."" Moe made the point that Grewal did not run in the recent election. However, MLAs do receive four months of transition pay following their time in the role. NDP Leader Carla Beck made a point of that, saying Herauf put it back to the legislative assembly to decide on a penalty. ""Just because there is no precedent, perhaps, doesn't mean that something shouldn't be done,"" said Beck. The motion failed on the assembly floor after a rowdy question period. The motion was introduced by Opposition ethics and democracy critic Meara Conway, who questioned the government's decision not to pursue any punishment for Grewal. ""Before Gary Grewal was a Sask. Party MLA, he made $1,309 off government contracts. While he was an MLA, he made $731,000,"" noted Conway, who asked what the government thought would be a proper penalty in this matter. ""Or should one-term MLAs who don't run again just be permitted to sail off into the sunset with three-quarters of a million dollars in their pocket?"" Minister of Social Services Terry Jensen did not entertain any possible punishments, instead saying ""the individual opposite should know that member is a private citizen, and that's where it will stay,"" said Jensen, adding that he accepts the report from COIC which left the decision regarding penalties with the legislative assembly. ""This is why people hate white-collar crime,"" said Conway, who noted that the government appeared to be letting Grewal off the hook ""without even a slap on the wrist."" Conway was cautioned by the Speaker of the house, Todd Goudy, who said the statements ""didn't seem to be appropriate."" In addition to kiboshing the emergency motion on Grewal, the government also opposed a motion to conduct an investigation into food prices in the North as a response to reports that doctors in La Ronge have treated 27 cases of scurvy within the last six months. alsalloum@postmedia.com","Leader Post; Regina, Sask.","Regina, Sask.","Salloum, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Fines & penalties; Conflicts of interest; Government contracts; Social services,,2024-12-06,Leader Post
Conservatives race ahead of ruling NDP on business and jobs; Tory MLAs meet with industry leaders to discuss province's economic growth,2024,"The B.C. Conservatives got ahead of the New Democrats this week in meeting with seven industry associations over concerns about economic growth and private sector employment. The Business Council of B.C., B.C. Chamber of Commerce and five other industry associations raised those issues in an open letter to the government on Oct. 30. They flagged the loss of manufacturing jobs, the lag in private sector employment and affordability. The New Democrats, continuing a slow-motion approach to their postelection agenda, have yet to set up a meeting with the seven or release a formal response to the letter. Nine Conservatives, led by Gavin Dew, MLA for Kelowna-Mission and the party's critic on jobs, economic development and innovation, met with the business organizations on Tuesday. ""I think it's quite notable we've made the effort to put together nine critics to go and meet with those folks and establish a relationship and get down to work on our approach to supporting private sector job growth,"" Dew told Rob Shaw of the Orca online newspaper. ""It's equally notable the NDP has not responded, and is totally silent, as to any indication of how they intend to shift direction."" Not every NDP minister has been slow off the mark on economic matters. On Tuesday, I was on a panel at the First Nations Energy Summit, put on by Clean Energy B.C. The room was buzzing over the previous day's presentation by Adrian Dix, the new minister of energy and climate solutions in the NDP government. Though two other ministers were in attendance, Dix got the most attention for his emphasis on building clean energy projects in partnership with First Nations. One of the organizers told me he'd lost count of the number of times Dix emphasized the need for ""urgency."" In that regard, B.C. Hydro is expected to announce by mid-month the successful respondents to this year's call for independent power projects. The hard part is getting them built in expedited fashion. But I gather Dix acknowledged as much Monday. If every minister in government were as on top of his files as Dix, the New Democrats would be living up to the premier's postelection promise to ""hit the ground running."" Back to the Conservatives and their meeting with the industry group. ""Throughout the meeting, Dew and his fellow critics emphasized their commitment to working collaboratively with industry leaders to develop a comprehensive recovery plan,"" according to the Opposition news release. ""Discussions also highlighted the province's growing fiscal challenges, including a projected $9 billion deficit for 2024-25, the largest in B.C.'s history."" No mention there of the corresponding lapse in the Conservative election platform. After declaring that ""B.C. is drowning in a sea of red ink,"" the Conservatives said it was their intention to top up the sea with another $2.3 billion in spending. Only after winning a second term of government (which presumes a lot) would the Conservatives ""return the budget to balance."" In the meeting with business leaders this week, ""the Conservative economic team reaffirmed its commitment to an inclusive and collaborative approach, ensuring that all voices are heard in the development of policies that drive long-term prosperity and job creation,"" according to the news release. Speaking of inclusivity, the Conservatives have not been in any evident rush to address lingering concerns about Brent Chapman, their winning candidate and MLA for Surrey South. Chapman was dogged during the campaign over some deeply offensive social media posts he'd made against the Muslim and Palestinian communities. He apologized, but also ducked media questions, a practice that has continued to this day. One of his few interviews since the election was with Tom Zillich of the Surrey Now-Leader. ""Chapman initially agreed to a phone interview, but later asked that questions be emailed, due to his busy schedule,"" according to the Nov. 15 posting in the Now-Leader. Zillich asked Chapman if he had ""reached out to Muslim groups"" over his posts on social media. In writing, Chapman pretty much ducked the question: ""I was fortunate to have Muslim people in Surrey South vote for me. Some told me that they voted for me in the hope that I would get SOGI out of schools, recriminalize hard drugs, bring safety back to our streets, help people experiencing homelessness, and bring down the cost of living. ""I intend to honour their support, the support of the rest of my voters and work hard for all the people of Surrey South."" Last week, several advocates in the Muslim community told the Tyee that Chapman has yet to respond to their invitations to meet with them. Reporter Jen St. Denis also wrote that ""Chapman did not respond to the Tyee's request for an interview for this story."" Conservative Leader John Rustad appointed Chapman critic for transit and ICBC. Both are major portfolios given persistent concerns over funding for rapid transit and the fallout from ""no fault"" auto insurance. Opposition critics are sometimes referred to as members of a ""shadow cabinet."" If Chapman continues to avoid the overdue reckoning with the Muslim community, he risks making his post all but invisible. vpalmer@postmedia.com","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Palmer, Vaughn",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Conservatism; Economic growth; Clean technology; Employment; Critics; Social networks,,2024-12-06,The Vancouver Sun
"NDP seeks to make GST rebate permanent, expand eligibility in opposition motion:   Motion calls on the Liberals to permanently remove GST from essential goods and expand its proposed $250 rebate to include adults who did not earn employment income in 2023",2024,"The NDP is seeking support from the House of Commons for changes to a government affordability plan that would make the proposed two-month GST rebate permanent and expand the list of those who would be eligible for a proposed $250 rebate. Both measures are part of a non-binding opposition motion that NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh put forward in the Commons on Friday that will be voted on Monday. The NDP motion calls on the Liberals to remove permanently the GST from essential goods, including home heating, grocery meals, internet and mobile phone bills, diapers and kids’ clothes. As well, the motion wants the government to expand its proposed $250 rebate to include adults who did not earn employment income in 2023 – recent graduates trying to enter the workforce, retired seniors and the disabled. The government could pay for the measures by enacting an excess-profit tax targeting the largest and most profitable corporations, the NDP motion says. Last month, the federal Liberals promised a two-month, targeted GST cut, and proposed to send $250 cheques to working Canadians in the spring. The GST cut has been passed by MPs and has moved to the Senate. The government did not receive the necessary support on the $250 cheques. Both measures, aimed at easing pocketbook pressures for households, would have cost the federal government $6.28-billion – $1.6-billion for the sales tax break and $4.68-billion for the cheques. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized the NDP position on cheques, saying the party is opposing a program to help working Canadians. Conservatives denounced the NDP motion Friday, with MP Jasraj Singh Hallan arguing Mr. Singh should not be able to move it as a member of the opposition because he has voted with the government a number of times. Assistant Deputy Speaker Carol Hughes, presiding during the exchange, said Mr. Singh is not a part of the government, “and the honorable member knows that full well.” In a statement on Friday, Mr. Singh was dismissive of Conservative opposition to his actions, calling it a “next-level tantrum from the Poilievre Conservatives,” referring to party leader Pierre Poilievre. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for Chrystia Freeland cited comments from the Finance Minister at a news conference earlier this week at which she said the government is moving forward with the rebate because it received support, but the GST cut has not found support. “That’s the reality of our position in a minority,” she said. Mr. Poilievre and Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet oppose both measures.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Bailey, Ian",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 6, 2024",,,2024-12-06,The Globe and Mail
Poilievre submits no-confidence motion:   Conservative leader attempts to use Singh's words against him in push for vote next week,2024,"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he agrees with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on one thing: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals are too weak to fight for Canadians. Poilievre kicked off debate in the House of Commons Thursday on a cheekily worded Conservative motion designed to use Singh's own words against him. The motion quotes some of Singh's harshest language against the Liberal government along with his staunch support for organized labour. Poilievre told the House his non-confidence motion will afford MPs the chance to vote on the ""wise things that he said"" when it's expected to come up next week. He said if Singh votes against it, that means ""he does not want to take responsibility"" for his words and have voters ""judge his record and his plans."" The Conservative opposition motion quotes Singh accusing the Liberals of being ""too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people,"" and that the Liberals will always ensure ""unions have no power"" by stepping in to stop labour disputes. That came after Ottawa's recent interventions to end disruptions by striking rail and port workers by asking the Canada Industrial Relations Board to intervene. But Singh has said he won't play Conservative games and will vote against the motion. In the back-and-forth, NDP MP Matthew Green scoffed at Poilievre's remarks and accused him of cosplaying as a supporter of organized labour. At one point, Liberal MP Mark Gerretsen accused Poilievre of using a prop, which is against House rules, to troll the Liberals. As Poilievre held onto his speaking notes, he had conspicuously placed at the bottom of the stack of papers a New York Times article featuring a large photo of Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly and a headline suggesting she could be Trudeau's successor. But it wasn't just the Conservatives playing tactical parliamentary shenanigans on Thursday. A surprise move by the NDP forced a debate on abortion access to delay the Conservative motion and siphon away House of Commons airtime on it Thursday. Ahead of Poilievre's motion coming up, NDP MP Heather McPherson suddenly seized the parliamentary remote control and changed the channel by springing a debate on a Foreign Affairs Committee report tabled in the House. McPherson also used the report, about Canada's global assistance for sexual and reproductive health rights, to pivot to domestic abortion issues by accusing the Conservatives of being beholden to abortion opponents and the Liberals of failing to protect access to services. ""The Liberals are too weak to stand up to premiers - those conservatives premiers - who are restricting access to women's health care,"" she said. When the Tories attempted to return to the regular scheduled programming, the Liberals and NDP ganged up and voted against them, further delaying the Conservative motion. The Tories charged that the NDP had hijacked the House agenda to protect Singh from a tough spot. Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer said it was a ""desperate attempt to limit debate"" through a ""procedural trick."" The Liberal government will face a raft of opposition motions in the coming days.","Toronto Star; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,"Torstar Syndication Services, a Division of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited","Dec 6, 2024",Conservatism; Womens health; Abortion; No confidence motions & votes,,2024-12-06,Toronto Star
NDP safe drug-use site a major strategic error,2024,"The Kinew government handed its political opponents a gift this week. As the NDP rolls out the province’s first supervised consumption site for drug users, it failed to consult community stakeholders over a proposed site in a South Point Douglas building. It also chose a location right across the street from a school. That’s red meat for the Opposition Progressive Conservative party, which is ideologically opposed to the sites, even though the harm-reduction strategy has proven time and time again across Canada and around the world to save lives by preventing drug overdoses. That evidence doesn’t matter to those who are philosophically against the sites. They continue to claim, without evidence, that they enable drug users and create unsafe conditions for local communities. Opponents, including the Manitoba Tories, instead promote the false dichotomy that the government should provide treatment options instead of safe consumption sites, as if the two are mutually exclusive. They’re not. Governments can do both. In fact, supervised consumption sites are often the gateway to treatment; they are trusted places where drug users are introduced to treatment options, sometimes for the first time. Despite that strong evidence, governments still have to take great care in how and when they open the sites, if for no other reason than to counteract the misinformation disseminated by critics. The NDP government has failed spectacularly on that front by giving their opponents an arsenal of ammunition to attack the proposed site at 200 Disraeli Fwy. What the government should have done before selecting a location was consult with community members, not only to get their feedback but also to provide them with information about how the harm-reduction strategy saves lives. They should have also chosen a spot that is not in close to a school or a child-care centre. Not only did the province fail to do the above, the NDP also appears to be proceeding in secret. The government did not announce the site location, it was discovered on a Health Canada website that shows the province applying for an exemption under the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (the exemption is required to open a supervised consumption site). Given the sensitivity and controversy around the sites, fuelled largely by critics and their misinformation, that is not the way this should have been rolled out. The province should have been open and transparent with the public during every stage of development, including site selection. The Tories and other critics will now blend their misinformation tactics with the procedural failings of the Kinew government in their attempt to create fear around the proposed site. “Provinces across the country — Ontario and other ones, as well — are closing consumption sites,” said MLA Carrie Hiebert, the Tory critic for addictions. “There’s a reason for that — it’s safety.” Actually it isn’t. It’s ideology. The decision by the Ford government in Ontario to close 10 supervised consumption sites was criticized by the province’s auditor general in her 2024 annual report, which was released this week. It included a performance assessment of the province’s opioid strategy and the Tory government’s decision to close the 10 sites by March 2025. “Supervised consumption services … are proven life-saving interventions,” auditor general Shelley Spence wrote in her report. Spence blasted the province for failing to assess the effect of closing the sites. She found internal government documents acknowledged that the planned closures increased the risk of overdose deaths, would put additional pressure on hospital emergency rooms and would increase the amount of discarded drug supplies, including needles, in public places. In 2022-23, none of the more than 2,500 opioid-related deaths in Ontario happened at supervised consumption sites and none of the 3,600 overdoses reported by them at their sites resulted in death, the report says. “Over 1,500 of these potentially fatal overdoses were prevented at the 10 to-be-closed supervised consumption services sites,” Spence wrote in her report. It’s easy for that evidence to get lost in the debate, though, when government is not open and transparent with the public and fails to consult with community stakeholders before opening a site. The NDP government will now have to move into full damage control to clean up the mess it created. It may even have to pick another site. Whether or not there is demonstrable harm in operating a safe consumption site across the street from a school, the appearance — especially for skeptics of harm reduction — is bad. This was a major strategic error by the Kinew government. tom.brodbeck@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Tom Brodbeck","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man.","Brodbeck, Tom",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 6, 2024",Drug overdose; Community; False information; Critics; Narcotics,,2024-12-06,Winnipeg Free Press
B.C. NDP lags on economy as Conservatives race ahead,2024,"VICTORIA - The B.C. Conservatives got ahead of the New Democrats this week in meeting with seven industry associations over concerns about economic growth and private sector employment. The Business Council of B.C., B.C. Chamber of Commerce and five other industry associations raised those issues in an open letter to the government on Oct. 30. They flagged the loss of manufacturing jobs, the lag in private sector employment and affordability. The New Democrats, continuing a slow-motion approach to their postelection agenda, have yet to set up a meeting with the seven or release a formal response to the letter. Nine Conservatives, led by Gavin Dew, MLA for Kelowna-Mission and the party's critic on jobs, economic development and innovation, met with the business organizations on Tuesday. ""I think it's quite notable we've made the effort to put together nine critics to go and meet with those folks and establish a relationship and get down to work on our approach to supporting private sector job growth,"" Dew told Rob Shaw of the Orca online newspaper. ""It's equally notable the NDP has not responded, and is totally silent, as to any indication of how they intend to shift direction."" Not every NDP minister has been slow off the mark on economic matters. On Tuesday, I was on a panel at the First Nations Energy Summit, put on by Clean Energy B.C. The room was buzzing over the previous day's presentation by Adrian Dix, the new minister of energy and climate solutions in the NDP government. Though two other ministers were in attendance, Dix got the most attention for his emphasis on building clean energy projects in partnership with First Nations. One of the organizers told me he'd lost count of the number of times Dix emphasized the need for ""urgency."" In that regard, B.C. Hydro is expected to announce by mid-month the successful respondents to this year's call for independent power projects. The hard part is getting them built in expedited fashion. But I gather Dix acknowledged as much Monday. If every minister in government were as on top of his files as Dix, the New Democrats would be living up to the premier's postelection promise to ""hit the ground running."" Back to the Conservatives and their meeting with the industry group. ""Throughout the meeting, Dew and his fellow critics emphasized their commitment to working collaboratively with industry leaders to develop a comprehensive recovery plan,"" according to the Opposition news release. ""Discussions also highlighted the province's growing fiscal challenges, including a projected $9 billion deficit for 2024-25, the largest in B.C.'s history."" No mention there of the corresponding lapse in the Conservative election platform. After declaring that ""B.C. is drowning in a sea of red ink,"" the Conservatives said it was their intention to top up the sea with another $2.3 billion in spending. Only after winning a second term of government (which presumes a lot) would the Conservatives ""return the budget to balance."" In the meeting with business leaders this week, ""the Conservative economic team reaffirmed its commitment to an inclusive and collaborative approach, ensuring that all voices are heard in the development of policies that drive long-term prosperity and job creation,"" according to the news release. Speaking of inclusivity, the Conservatives have not been in any evident rush to address lingering concerns about Brent Chapman, their winning candidate and MLA for Surrey South. Chapman was dogged during the campaign over some deeply offensive social media posts he'd made against the Muslim and Palestinian communities. He apologized, but also ducked media questions, a practice that has continued to this day. One of his few interviews since the election was with Tom Zillich of the Surrey Now-Leader. ""Chapman initially agreed to a phone interview, but later asked that questions be emailed, due to his busy schedule,"" according to the Nov. 15 posting in the Now-Leader. Zillich asked Chapman if he had ""reached out to Muslim groups"" over his posts on social media. In writing, Chapman pretty much ducked the question: ""I was fortunate to have Muslim people in Surrey South vote for me. Some told me that they voted for me in the hope that I would get SOGI out of schools, recriminalize hard drugs, bring safety back to our streets, help people experiencing homelessness, and bring down the cost of living. ""I intend to honour their support, the support of the rest of my voters and work hard for all the people of Surrey South."" Last week, several advocates in the Muslim community told the Tyee that Chapman has yet to respond to their invitations to meet with them. Reporter Jen St. Denis also wrote that ""Chapman did not respond to the Tyee's request for an interview for this story."" Conservative leader John Rustad appointed Chapman critic for transit and ICBC. Both are major portfolios given persistent concerns over funding for rapid transit and the fallout from ""no fault"" auto insurance. Opposition critics are sometimes referred to as members of a ""shadow cabinet."" If Chapman continues to avoid the overdue reckoning with the Muslim community, he risks making his post all but invisible. vpalmer@postmedia.com Related Vaughn Palmer: 'Recalibration' stalls $1 billion B.C. battery plant expansion once celebrated by David Eby, Justin Trudeau Thank you for your service to B.C.

Sask. Party government blocks NDP from calling former MLA to testify on hotel controversy,2024,"Former Saskatchewan Party MLA Gary Grewal will not be made to appear before the legislative assembly to answer questions about breaching the conflict of interest act. On Thursday, the NDP Opposition introduced two emergency motions, one of which called on Grewal to appear before the committee of the whole assembly ""to answer questions about the Ministry of Social Services' hotel policies and the Conflict of Interest Commissioner's opinion of October 21, 2024."" Related Former Sask. Party MLA Gary Grewal breached conflict of interest act: report Social services spent $11.2M on hotel procurement since 2018: Minister That opinion from Conflict of Interest Commissioner (COIC) Maurice Herauf found that Grewal breached the Act twice while he was sitting as a Sask. Party MLA. Grewal became the focus of two COIC investigations once it came to light that a pair of hotels with which he was affiliated or owned had entered into contracts with the Ministry of Social Services. Specifically, the Sunrise and Thriftlodge motels saw a surge in government contracts after Grewal's 2020 election. Over those four years, the motels linked to Grewal received $731,000 from the Ministry. Speaking after question period, Premier Scott Moe said ""you don't see Mr. Grewal here,"" in response to questions about a penalty. When pressed on the message it sends if the former MLA faces no consequences, Moe responded: ""Historically, has that ever occurred? Not to my knowledge."" Moe made the point that Grewal did not run in the recent election. However, MLAs do receive four months of transition pay following their time in the role. NDP Leader Carla Beck made a point of that, saying Herauf put it back to the legislative assembly to decide on a penalty. ""Just because there is no precedent, perhaps, doesn't mean that something shouldn't be done,"" said Beck. The motion failed on the assembly floor after a rowdy a question period. The motion was introduced by Opposition ethics and democracy critic Meara Conway, who questioned the government's decision not to pursue any punishment for Grewal. ""Before Gary Grewal was a Sask. Party MLA, he made $1,309 off government contracts. While he was an MLA, he made $731,000,"" noted Conway, who asked what the government thought would be a proper penalty in this matter. ""Or should one-term MLAs who don't run again just be permitted to sail off into the sunset with three-quarters of a million dollars in their pocket?"" Minister of Social Services Terry Jensen did not entertain any possible punishments, instead saying ""the individual opposite should know that member is a private citizen, and that's where it will stay,"" said Jensen, adding that he accepts the report from COIC which left the decision regarding penalties with the legislative assembly. ""This is why people hate white-collar crime,"" said Conway, who noted that the government appeared to be letting Grewal off the hook ""without even a slap on the wrist."" Conway was cautioned by the Speaker of the House, Todd Goudy, who said the statements ""didn't seem to be appropriate."" In addition to kiboshing the emergency motion on Grewal, the government also opposed a motion to conduct an investigation into food prices in the North as a response to reports that doctors in La Ronge have treated 27 cases of scurvy within the last six months. alsalloum@postmedia.com",The Leader Post (Online); Regina,Regina,"Salloum, Alec",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 5, 2024",Fines & penalties; Conflicts of interest; Government contracts; Social services; Hotels & motels,,2024-12-05,Leader Post
"Liberals to face confidence motions, including one inspired by Jagmeet Singh",2024,"OTTAWA It's confidence time again in the House of Commons. Conservatives will soon put forward three confidence motions to try to topple the government after the Speaker of the House of Commons ruled that the Liberals will face four opposition days in the coming week, temporarily ending a two-month filibuster. In a statement to the National Post, Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer confirmed that the first confidence motion will be debated on Thursday. ""Common sense Conservatives are eager to end Canadians'suffering after nine years of Justin Trudeau and are giving Sellout Jagmeet Singh yet another opportunity to put the people before his pension and vote non-confidence to trigger a carbon tax election,"" Scheer said. The party introduced its motion last week, using NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh's own words by stating ""the Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people."" ""The House agrees with the leader of the NDP and the House declares that it has lost confidence in the Prime Minister and the government,"" reads the motion. The Bloc intends to support the Conservatives, while the NDP does not appear inclined to do so. If the minority Liberals survive such a vote, the Conservatives promised to put forward two more confidence motions on Monday and Tuesday of next week. The Conservatives have already tried twice to bring down the government this fall. Each time, the NDP came to the Liberals' rescue. The NDP will have an opposition day on Friday and will announce the subject of the party's motion on Wednesday, but it seems unlikely that the party will introduce a confidence motion. The opposition motions will come after months of parliamentary wrangling caused by the lengthy privilege debate. Last week, the Conservatives seemed eager to introduce their motion, but on Monday morning, government House leader Karina Gould's attempt to allocate the remaining opposition days of this session was rebuked by the Tories. The Speaker of the House of Commons ruled Monday afternoon that the filibuster would be suspended to give the opposition four days and the House to begin voting on the budget estimates Tuesday night. One of the main functions of the House of Commons is to grant supply so the government can spend money, but the months-long privilege debate has prevented the House from doing that. The government needs the money to fund new spending on the dental care program, support for Ukraine and the Canadian Armed Forces. ""This is a fundamental part of what Parliament does. So, despite the ridiculous games the Conservatives are playing to try to obstruct the important work that parliamentarians do on behalf of Canadians, we are going to get this work done,"" Gould said Tuesday morning.

"NDP will support personal income tax rate changes; Opposition urges cuts to fuel, sales levies",2024,"The Opposition NDP says it is prepared to support the Saskatchewan Party's legislation to lower personal income taxes - but people need more to help with the cost of living. Premier Scott Moe's government on Monday introduced The Saskatchewan Affordability Act, which is to raise personal income tax exemptions while indexing tax brackets to match inflation, saving an average family of four more than $3,400 over four years. ""We certainly won't hold this up, but what we need is much more than that,"" Opposition NDP finance critic Trent Wotherspoon said. ""We need action now to save families'hard-earned dollars as they head into the holiday season."" The Opposition has been pushing Moe to suspend the provincial 15-cent-a-litre fuel tax and axe the provincial sales tax on ready-to-eat grocery items. Two of their emergency motions on those issues have failed to pass in the house. Speaking with reporters, Wotherspoon stood behind a table of groceries to which provincial sales taxes apply, including a cooked rotisserie chicken, granola bars, pre-made salads and cut fruit and vegetables. ""Oftentimes people are going to (the grocery store) picking up a rotisserie chicken. This fruit (platter) is taxed; same with a veggie platter,"" he said. ""These are the kinds of staples that families are relying on. We need to provide some relief."" Finance Minister Jim Reiter told reporters an estimated 54,000 Saskatchewan residents will not pay provincial income tax once the changes are in place. The Saskatchewan Party had proposed the measures during the October election campaign. The legislation introduced Monday also includes a tax credit for first-time homebuyers, along with a credit for home renovations that would provide savings of up to $420 per year. The bill also promises a 25-percent increase in tax credits for children under 18 who have disabilities, and for caregivers. It keeps the small business tax rate at one per cent while doubling benefits to help families put their children in sports and arts programs. Reiter said the province won't support the NDP's proposals, arguing the government needs revenues for services. ""I don't like taxes. I'd love to cut taxes everywhere, but we have to have revenue to operate,"" he said. Reiter said he will write a letter to the federal government to fast-track approval of the personal income tax changes so residents can start seeing a break in January. He said the tax reduction will cost $140 million in the first year. The Sask. Party on Tuesday followed Monday's announcement with Minister Responsible for SaskEnergy Jeremy Harrison introducing The SaskEnergy Amendment Act, which will extend the carbon tax exemption on home heating - another of the Sask. Party's promises during the recent provincial election campaign. The bill would amend The SaskEnergy Act and The SaskEnergy Amendment Act to ensure the provincial government remains the sole registered distributor of natural gas for the purposes of the federal Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act. ""Our government is protecting Saskatchewan families'ability to affordably heat their homes this winter and ensuring fairness for those same families who were left out in the cold by (Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's) decision to exempt the carbon tax from home heating oil,"" Harrison said. ""Our government will keep fighting until the carbon tax is removed everywhere, on everything, for everyone."" Saskatchewan on Jan. 1 stopped collecting the carbon tax on natural gas used for home heating. The move was in response to what Moe called an ""unfair"" exemption granted by the Liberal government on home heating oil, which primarily benefits people in Atlantic Canada. The CRA then issued a collection notice in June for $28 million - a portion of the unpaid carbon levies. In response, the province filed an injunction request and judicial review challenging the CRA by arguing that it is unconstitutional to collect from Saskatchewan but not Atlantic Canada. A Federal Court justice on July 5 granted a temporary interim injunction to stop collection, pending a hearing on a formal stay order, both at Saskatchewan's request. The hearing was eventually adjourned when negotiations between the two levels of government put a pause on efforts to collect the payments. At the time, Saskatchewan agreed to establish a line of credit which will remain in place while it argues a larger constitutionality challenge in federal tax court. The province says the removal of the federal carbon tax from residential SaskEnergy bills is saving the average Saskatchewan family around $400 this year. Due to the expected increase in the carbon tax on April 1, 2025, from $80 to $95 per tonne, the continued removal of the federal carbon tax from residential SaskEnergy bills will save the average Saskatchewan family about $480 in 2025, the province says.

"Trudeau calls Canada Soccer spying scandal ‘unfortunate’ but mum on MPs’ decision not to hold public hearing:   As Olympians visit Parliament, NDP MP Niki Ashton asks why the Liberals were ‘blocking’ efforts for accountability over drone-spying scheme",2024,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament Wednesday that the Canada Soccer spying scandal was “extremely unfortunate,” but he declined to weigh in on a decision by a Commons committee to not hold a public hearing into the matter. Mr. Trudeau’s first public comments on the drone-spying controversy at the Paris Olympics in July came in response to a question by NDP MP Niki Ashton. Speaking on a day that Olympians were visiting Parliament, Ms. Ashton asked why the Liberals were “blocking efforts at accountability” into the cheating scheme. “The incident with drones and Canada Soccer was extremely unfortunate,” the Prime Minister said, adding, “that’s why there have been consequences. That’s why we continue to ensure there are follow-ups.” Last week, a majority of MPs on the standing committee on Canadian heritage – which provides some federal oversight for national sports organizations – voted against a motion by Ms. Ashton calling for a hearing with testimony from former and current Canada Soccer coaches, executives, players and the minister of sport. Instead, they voted for an amendment proposed by the Bloc Québécois, agreeing to meet privately with Sonia Regenbogen, the author of a report on the drone-spying scandal. Mr. Trudeau said all committees work independent of government. Ms. Ashton said she understands federal ministers are not supposed to direct committees, but said afterward there’s been “a pretty sustained effort from the Liberals to avoid this issue at all costs.” “Many Canadians, including former athletes, have been calling on the government to do the right thing,” she said. “Bring about full accountability in terms of the drone scandal and culture surrounding it so that it never happens again.” In October, the heritage committee’s five Liberals and lone Bloc member voted against a similar motion by Ms. Ashton to further probe the spying scandal. Ms. Ashton filed her latest motion in response to recent reporting by The Globe and Mail into workplace and spying issues inside the women’s program, which showed the soccer federation had warnings about spying problems from staff more than a year before the Paris Olympics. She wanted former head coach Bev Priestman and her predecessor, John Herdman – who stepped down as head coach of Toronto’s Major League Soccer club TFC on Friday – to appear before MPs, along with other key players in the spying scheme. Jonathan Robinson, a spokesperson for the Minister of Sport, said last week that Canada Soccer was already under greater scrutiny than other national sport organizations because of financial issues that predated the spying scandal – with Ottawa demanding a financial audit and a governance review, and the creation of an external advisory group for the federation to continue receiving federal funding. In July, Sport Canada suspended the pay for Ms. Priestman, her assistant coach Jasmine Mander and analyst Joey Lombardi, who were all banned from soccer for a year by FIFA for their role in a plot to gather footage via drone from New Zealand’s closed practices ahead of their match against Canada at the Olympics. Lawyers for Ms. Priestman and Ms. Mander said some of the allegations against their clients were inaccurate, but declined to elaborate. Mr. Lombardi has not responded to repeated requests for comment. Mr. Herdman has not addressed the spying allegations directly, but has said none of his staff, to his knowledge, spied on opponents at the Olympics or World Cup.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Mercer, Greg",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 4, 2024",Olympic games; Public hearings; Scandals; Soccer; Prime ministers; Accountability,Nom: Canada Soccer; NAICS: 813990,2024-12-04,The Globe and Mail
"NDP to vote against Tory no-confidence motion, saving PM for now",2024,"NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Tuesday his party won't support an upcoming Conservative no-confidence motion that uses his own criticism of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals, saving the government from falling and delaying a possible election - for now. But the New Democrats - which hold the balance of the minority Parliament as other parties demand an immediate election - will have to vote on three more confidence tests in the coming weeks. ""It probably comes as no surprise that I'm not going to play Pierre Poilievre's games. He wants to cut people's pensions. I want to strengthen pensions. He wants to cut dental care.

MLA booted out of NDP caucus files ethics complaint about premier over children's book,2024,"Ousted NDP MLA Mark Wasyliw has filed an ethics complaint against Premier Wab Kinew over the publication of his children’s book An Anishinaabe Christmas. In the latest chapter following his dramatic removal from the NDP caucus in September, the independent member for Fort Garry is accusing the premier and author of violating ethics commissioner Jeffrey Schnoor’s directive concerning publication of his books. Schnoor’s Nov. 2, 2023 letter to Kinew provided by the premier’s office acknowledged that before becoming premier, he had submitted three books to his publisher that were awaiting publication. “At some point in the future, your publisher will publish them and make them available to the public for purchase,” Schnoor wrote. “The decision on when this takes place is the publisher’s; you will play no role in this decision.” An Anishinaabe Christmas was one of the three books, Kinew’s press secretary said Tuesday. The ethics commissioner directed Kinew not to submit anything further for publication. He told the premier not to engage in any activities to promote the sale of his books and to ask his publisher to refrain from identifying him as premier on the books or promotional materials. Wasyliw’s complaint to Schnoor tabled in the legislature Tuesday afternoon said promotional materials have identified the author as Manitoba’s premier and provided links to his social media accounts that identify him as premier. The MLA for Fort Garry cited a web page from Penguin Random House promoting the book that refers to the author as a “provincial politician in Manitoba” and provides hyperlinks to Kinew’s political website. Promotional articles in the Nov. 28 Montreal Gazette and U.S. book-review magazine Kirkus Reviews refer to Kinew as the premier of Manitoba. “Any promotion of his work would inevitably include references to him being premier of Manitoba,” Wasyliw’s two-page complaint said. “By publishing any work while premier of Manitoba, Wab Kinew will inevitably trade his public profile and status that will directly benefit him in a pecuniary manner. This is unavoidable,” the MLA and criminal defence lawyer wrote. “The only ethical recourse would be a prohibition on any publications while he is premier,” Wasyliw’s complaint says. He’s asked the ethics commissioner to investigate whether Kinew broke conflict-of-interest rules. Schnoor confirmed he received the request Tuesday but couldn’t comment further. When asked to comment Tuesday, the premier’s office referred to Schnoor’s letter from last year, noting that An Anishinaabe Christmas was one of the three books the ethics commissioner knew about and was OK with being published after Kinew became premier. The ethics commissioner wrote that he was satisfied Kinew’s work as an author carried out through his Grey Cloud Media Inc. “will not create a conflict between your private interests and your official powers, duties or functions. I am further satisfied that a reasonable person would not see these activities as creating such a conflict.” carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca Credit: Carol Sanders","Winnipeg Free Press; Winnipeg, Man.","Winnipeg, Man .","Sanders, Carol",FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership,"Dec 4, 2024",Conflicts of interest; Ethics; Books,,2024-12-04,Winnipeg Free Press

"Bell: Smith throws down gauntlet against Trudeau, Nenshi NDP vote No",2024,"The premier stands up in the legislature Monday afternoon and says she is standing up for Alberta. Last week, Premier Danielle Smith told your scribbler it was time to use the stick on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his green guru Steven Guilbeault. Time had run out on Smith offering up carrots. There would be no olive branch this time. She had tried to play nice. Sometimes, certain observers thought she was being too nice. She didn't get nice in return. Not even close. So Smith stands up and asks all provincial politicians, all members of the Alberta legislature to support her government's fight back against Trudeau's cap on oilpatch greenhouse gas emissions. Once again, on Monday afternoon, Smith builds her case. The premier talks about the pain of 92,000 jobs lost in Alberta alone. Oilpatch production would have to be cut to meet Trudeau's aggressive emissions reductions. ""It all speaks disaster for Alberta's economy and Alberta families. We stand with Alberta energy workers and Alberta families,"" says Smith. The premier talks about how the federal Liberal government is trying to muscle in where it doesn't belong. ""We cannot sit back and allow to them to steamroll over the Constitution and we will not,"" she says. Related Bell: Smith and Trudeau, now a third Alberta-Ottawa dust-up this week Bell: At Team Canada meeting, Smith tells Trudeau to back off Bell: Smith tells Canada, Trudeau to take Trump tariff issues seriously She points out in a decade there would be a $12-billion reduction in oil and gas dollars going into the Alberta government treasury and $12 billion would be cutting money for health care nearly in half. She talks about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his threat to hit Canadian goods heading stateside with a 25 per cent tariff or charge. Smith says one of the main topics jawed over when Trudeau met Trump at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago digs was oil and gas. Trump expressed disappointment the Keystone XL pipeline was kiboshed by current U.S. president Joe Biden and talked about ways where Canada can help the Americans on the energy front. The premier adds a cap on emissions would result in less oil for the States, not more. ""We cannot be complacent, especially not now,"" says Smith. For Smith, it is not rocket science. Trump wants a secure supply of energy. Alberta is ready to provide it. Trudeau has to recognize that fact. ""We want to be part of Team Canada but we need Team Canada to be on Team Alberta,"" adds the premier, saying not doing so makes it tougher to deal with Trump. ""We will have no credibility in making the case to the Americans that we truly intend to meet their energy demands if the federal government persists with an energy cap that would result in production going down between now and 2030."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shared this image to social media a day after meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Fla., on Friday night. As she speaks, you can't help but think Smith will be asking Santa to give us a new Team Canada captain as soon as possible. On this day, Smith also reads comments from groups and individuals opposed to what Trudeau was doing. One statement says this move on the oilpatch has much more to do with green guru Guilbeault's bias against the energy industry. Smith figures either the Trudeau government did not do their homework on how bad their emissions cap would be to Alberta and Canada or they simply do not care. How many of you are picking Door Number Two? So Smith tells us she will use all legal means against Trudeau's emissions cap and going to court is nowhere near the end of this movie. The federal government will not be allowed on oil and gas facilities without getting a provincial say-so ""We certainly do not want federal agents nosing around without our permission."" Greenhouse gas emission numbers collected by oilpatch companies will go to the Alberta government ""rather than have the federal government take the data, skew it and use it against us to say something it doesn't say."" A dump truck works near an oilsands extraction facility near Fort McMurray. Smith also says the Alberta government will cut deals to sell bitumen, conventional oil and natural gas without the federal government standing in the way. ""We will make sure our friends, allies and trading partners have the resources they need."" The premier is not done. She says opinion is moving away from the Trudeau government view of how the world works. ""The world is changing their perspective on the need for energy security,"" says Smith. ""I think what we have seen in the last five years is the fantasy vision of Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault that our entire economy can be powered on solar and wind and batteries has been blown out of the water."" There it is. Smith makes her move. ""If we don't stand up now we risk so much more and that is not a risk I am willing to take."" And, as deadlines loom, we get the news.

"Mandryk: Sask. Party, NDP reverse roles on tax affordability packages",2024,"One of the more bizarre elements of the 2024 provincial election was Carla Beck's New Democrats campaigning like conservatives and Premier Scott Moe's Saskatchewan Party campaigning like New Democrats ... at least, when it came to taxes and affordability. This week, we saw the culmination of this strange role reversal in the introduction of the Sask. Party's centrepiece legislation - the Affordability Act. To better understand, one first has to get past the now decades-old Sask. Party rhetoric about how this policy - and, frankly, every policy - is simply about ensuring ""the province remains the most affordable place to live, work, raise a family and start a business in Canada."" Putting it bluntly, it's really always about appealing to the broadest base of voters imaginable - generally, the middle-class people who are admittedly feeling the current squeeze of inflation. Unfortunately, affordability seldom strictly means helping people who can least afford things. It's more about helping those who help you with their votes. Evidently tired of getting crushed in the last four Saskatchewan election campaigns, Beck and the NDP clearly decided prior to the last election that two can play this game. The NDP's own affordability bundle focussed on eye-catching policies like lifting the gas tax for six months - a policy that would more benefit those who can afford or prefer carbon-tax guzzling vehicles - and the Saskatchewan NDP do not support that carbon tax. But does this policy best reflect the traditional NDP philosophy? Well, perhaps not. This takes us to the suite of election promises of affordability measures from the Sask. Party, introduced in legislative form on Monday. Highlighting the 13 affordability commitments is what Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Jim Reiter called the ""the largest personal income tax reduction in the province since 2008,"" in which the Sask. Party has vowed to raise personal exemptions, spousal exemptions, child exemptions and the seniors' supplements by $500 a year for the next four years. Also, the province's income tax brackets and basic tax credits will be indexed to offset the impacts of inflation. Beck rightly noted in Monday's question period that focussing on income tax measures means people won't get a break until 2026, and ""people need relief now."" It is true that there's little in Reiter's package (beyond not collecting the carbon tax on home heating) that will help anyone immediately. But it's similarly important to note that the NDP's proposal for gas tax elimination is a ""temporary"" six-month lift. Similar to the bizarre federal government decision to lift the GST for two months, such temporary lifts mostly just create a bureaucratic nightmare for stores that would have to recalibrate gas pumps and registers. More critical, however, is who - proportionally speaking - is helped the most. Cutting consumption taxes generally helps people with the economic wherewithal to consume - which is why they are generally more preferred by right-of-centre parties than left-of-centre parties. But reducing income tax from the bottom up means, as Reiter noted, more than 54,000 working poor people will no longer be paying provincial income tax. Add in the 50 per cent increase in the Saskatchewan First-Time Homebuyers Credit maximum benefit, and the Home Renovation Tax Credit allowing homeowners to save $420 per year on home renovations, or $525 per year for seniors. Finally, the Affordability Act package does specifically help some of the most disadvantaged with changes to both the Caregiver Tax Credit and the Disability Tax Credit that will increase the respective supplement for children by 25 per cent (plus indexation), which will support families caring for adult children or parents with physical or mental disabilities. Certainly, NDP criticisms that the Sask. Party is not doing enough for the homeless or social assistance rates remain valid. But governance is about choices. And many would argue that helping caregivers, seniors, disabled people and the working poor is more crucial than helping others with a gas tax decrease that ends next spring. Some of those making that argument might be traditional New Democrats. Mandryk is the political columnist for the Regina Leader-Post and the Saskatoon StarPhoenix.

"NDP MP Randall Garrison to step down due to health reasons:   The Vancouver Island MP said that his remarks are likely his last as the member for Esquimalt–Saanich–Sooke, a riding he has held since first being elected in 2011",2024,"NDP MP Randall Garrison announced he will step down next month due to health reasons. The Vancouver Island MP previously said he would not seek re-election but told the House of Commons Tuesday that he had submitted a letter of resignation to the Speaker earlier in the day, effective in January. “After more than four years' waiting, I now have a family doctor and it’s time to listen to his advice about putting my health first,” Mr. Garrison said. He said that his remarks are likely his last as the member for Esquimalt–Saanich–Sooke, a riding he has held since first being elected in 2011. Mr. Garrison served as the NDP critic for justice, 2SLGBTQI+ rights and as deputy defence critic. Before becoming an MP, he was a councillor for the Victoria-area town of Esquimalt and an instructor at Camosun College. In his remarks to the House, he thanked supporters and offered special thanks to his husband, whom he noted has always been encouraging of his work in public office. Mr. Garrison said being an MP was never part of his plan, but that former NDP leader Jack Layton encouraged him to seek public office, saying there should be more gay members of Parliament. “My time in Parliament has always been devoted to finding common ground to advance all Canadians and especially the most marginalized folks,” he said. Mr. Garrison was praised by members across the aisle. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh was effusive in his praise for Mr. Garrison. “I am proud that he chose to be a part of this movement. I’m so, so thankful he said yes to Jack.” Speaker of the House and Liberal MP Greg Fergus said Mr. Garrison’s work and career have deeply affected many Canadians including members of his own family, making specific reference to Mr. Garrison’s work for 2SLGBTQI+ rights. Justice Minister Arif Virani, a Liberal MP, said Mr. Garrison is a classy individual who has always been a fierce defender of his riding, known for his work on justice files and with the 2SLGBTQI+ community. Mr. Virani said he has never seen a more co-operative or collaborative MP, noting Mr. Garrison always understood where partisanship had to be replaced by principle to collaborate productively and advance causes such as the fight against hate. “He represents the best of what it is to be a parliamentarian in this chamber,” said Mr. Virani.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Bailey, Ian",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 3, 2024",Collaboration,,2024-12-03,The Globe and Mail
"Trudeau Liberals to face spate of confidence votes, will again rely on NDP for support in minority Parliament:   Opposition Conservatives signal intent to table motion of non-confidence, invoking words of NDP leader Singh",2024,"The minority Liberals will face a spate of Parliamentary tests in the next week as the Conservatives plan three confidence votes on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which will be followed by the House weighing in on its spending priorities. The House of Commons has been at a standstill for more than two months, as opposition parties have held up most of the agenda by debating parliamentary privilege over the government’s refusal to release documents connected to a green fund spending and ethics scandal. On Monday, however, Speaker Greg Fergus ruled that the filibuster must be paused to allow the House to hold its opposition days and vote on the new spending, called supplementary estimates, before returning to the privilege debate and resulting standoff. Mr. Fergus scheduled opposition days for Thursday and Friday of this week and Monday and Tuesday of next week. Three of those days will go to the Conservatives, who quickly confirmed they will use all three of those days to table non-confidence motions against the government. The first such motion, which is expected to be debated on Thursday, will amp up the pressure on the NDP. The Conservative motion uses Leader Jagmeet Singh’s own critiques of the Liberals as the basis for the non-confidence vote. “The NDP Leader said, ‘the Liberals are too weak, too selfish and too beholden to corporate interests to fight for people,’” reads part of the Conservative motion. “The House agrees with the NDP Leader and the House proclaims it has lost confidence in the Prime Minister and the Government.” Despite that framing, Mr. Singh suggested on Tuesday that the New Democrats will still vote with the government to defeat the motion. “I’m not going to play Pierre Poilievre’s games,” the NDP leader told reporters. “I’m, frankly, not going to allow him to cut the things that people need. I want to actually have dental care expanded. I want to see more people actually start to benefit from the pharmacare we passed.” Those arguments are in line with the Liberals' position. House Leader Karina Gould noted that the NDP would have to keep the government alive through the confidence votes if it wants to ensure new spending to be passed as well. “If the NDP wants there to be more money for dental care we need to pass the confidence votes first,” she said. She accused the Conservatives of “ridiculous games” to obstruct the work of the House. “We are going to get this work done,” she added. As long as the Conservative motion remains unchanged, the Bloc Québécois will vote with the official opposition to try to defeat the government, said spokesperson Joanie Riopel. However, that won’t be enough to bring down the government. On Tuesday BQ Leader Yves-François Blanchet said the party will decide how to vote on each confidence motion based on whether the Bloc believes it is good for Quebeckers. Treasury Board President Anita Anand tabled the government’s supplementary estimates in November, outlining $24.8-billion in new spending, of which $21.6-billion requires a vote of approval by the House of Commons.

"In rare move, Speaker pauses standoff:   Ruling allows both Conservatives and NDP to control agenda for four days",2024,"Weeks of speculation over how a lengthy impasse in the House of Commons would be halted to address critical parliamentary business ended Monday, when Speaker Greg Fergus intervened to pause the standoff. In a rare move, Fergus delivered a ruling in the lower chamber that temporarily suspended the stalemate, allowing for both the Conservatives and the New Democrats to control the parliamentary agenda for four days, and for MPs to greenlight $21.6 billion in proposed spending. The four so-called opposition days, and Ottawa's supplementary estimates, needed to be dealt with by Dec. 10, which is when the government's supply period ends. But the chances of that happening had been looking nail-bitingly slim as the calendar flipped to December, and a weeks-long privilege debate in the House of Commons showed no signs of slowing down. Since late September, Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives have gummed up most parliamentary proceedings in an effort to compel the Liberal government to cough up unredacted documents tied to a now-defunct green technology funding agency that was riddled with mismanagement issues. Because Fergus had ruled that the issue should take precedence over other parliamentary business, that debate - and a separate privilege motion concerning former Liberal cabinet minister Randy Boissonault's former business partner - blocked other key parliamentary matters from moving forward. One of those matters is set to be a test of confidence in Justin Trudeau's Liberal government - and a test for their former governing partners, the NDP. The first opposition motion will hit the Commons floor on Thursday, when the Conservatives will attempt to pressure other opposition parties to declare lost confidence in the Trudeau government. The motion draws on critical language the NDP's Jagmeet Singh has used in the past to lambaste Trudeau, in an effort to compel the New Democrats to join the Conservatives in toppling the Liberals under the current minority Parliament scenario. That motion is set to be voted on Dec. 9. But that vote will be tangled up in a series of others: the NDP will table an opposition motion of their own later this week, which will go to a vote on the same day. Two other Conservative opposition motions will be dealt with the following day. And by that night - Dec. 10 - billions of dollars in proposed spending for initiatives like military procurement projects, national affordability programs, and aid for Ukraine, will also go to a vote.

PCs block NDP motion on child welfare:   Opposition MPPs wanted Ford government to launch emergency committee on systemic issues,2024,"Amid a worsening crisis affecting Ontario's most vulnerable kids, the opposition New Democrats plan to keeping fighting for changes to a ""crumbling"" child welfare system. ""We have seen staggering numbers of children and families who are falling through the cracks,"" MPP Monique Taylor said Monday afternoon, when introducing a motion later voted down by the PC majority on the standing committee on social policy. ""We have children who are sleeping in hotels, motels, Airbnbs. We've had a kid who's sleeping in a trailer in the back parking lot of a CAS office. We have a kid who slept in the CAS office ... We have had children die that haven't been able to be identified for over a year"" because of communication lapses in the system, she added. While her motion to look at the issue was defeated 6-3, Taylor said she plans to continue to urge the government to do better. Taylor had been asking for emergency meetings on child and youth welfare, calling in experts to help create a system to improve kids' mental health and well-being at school, in care and in the justice system. Earlier Monday during question period, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Michael Parsa defended the government's record, saying it has addressed kids' needs and boosted funding. ""There's nothing more important than making sure the future generation is supported so that they continue to succeed and thrive wherever they are in the province,"" he said. ""We backed that up by record investments ... Across the board, we have increased investments in every area of this ministry so that no child or youth is ever left behind in our province."" Child advocates said they were disappointed in the failed NDP motion after months of calls for action. Irwin Elman, who served as Ontario's child and youth advocate from 2008 to 2019, said that despite the government's investments in mental health and the child welfare sectors, families remain in an ""unprecedented crisis"" because the system is failing children who need help most. He said it's time for the provincial parties to come together to build a new one. A Star series revealed that children with complex health needs are coming into the care of children's aid societies not because of protection concerns, such as abuse and neglect, but because their families are unable to access treatment and support. Families have told the Star they face years-long wait-lists and an acute lack of live-in treatment options and respite services; many say they cannot access specialized care because their child is considered ""too high-needs."" Child welfare leaders say they are receiving an increase in the number of calls from families who can no longer cope and have been told their only option is to ""abandon"" their child. In some regions, children's aid societies have been placing kids and teens with complex needs in motels or office buildings for lack of options - a practice the Ontario Ombudsman is investigating. In October, the province announced an audit of 37 non-Indigenous children's aid societies to examine operating costs as well as the quality of child protection services. The motion echoed demands from advocates, child welfare leaders, mental health service providers and policy experts who have been warning about a growing number of families in crisis. Elman, now president of the non-profit child rights' organization Defence For Children International - Canada, said a group led by his organization and the Ontario Autism Coalition intend to hold public hearings at the legislature in late February to examine how Ontario could create a ""North Star"" child well-being system, similar to B.C.'s. At Queen's Park, Taylor, the NDP critic for children, community and social services since 2011, spoke about the crisis facing children and youth. ""They're in for-profit placements, being used as cash cows. Children are being sent home from school because they have no supports or staff available"" in schools. ""That is the reality of Ontario families."" She noted 73,000 kids are waiting for autism services. In the legislature, Parsa noted a $76.3-million funding boost to children's aid societies last year and $14 million more to child protection, despite a decline in the number of kids needing services. ""When it comes to children and youth, we will never, ever give up on them,"" Parsa said. But Taylor said the government continues to fail to provide the necessary supports and services to children. She cited a recent report for the B.C. government called ""Don't Look Away"" that is a ""commitment to do a system-wide overhaul,"" including better tracking of children's health and well-being. She urged the province to do the same. But Parsa said the government doesn't see the point of more studies on the issue because ""this is a government of action.""

"Mr. Eby needs to listen – in the B.C. legislature:   The NDP Leader doesn’t plan to deliver a Throne Speech until mid-February, nearly four months after the provincial election",2024,"British Columbia’s legislators last appeared inside the marble-clad chamber on May 16, before ducking out the door to prepare for a fall election. That election has now come and gone, but the 93 men and women chosen to represent their constituents won’t return to the House until Feb. 18. Lieutenant-Governor Janet Austin invited David Eby to form a government on Oct. 26, confirming the NDP leader’s victory after a cliffhanger of an election. Since then, Mr. Eby has talked a lot about respecting the verdict of voters, who came very close to tossing out his New Democrats. He says he heard a clear message that British Columbians want action on issues of affordability, health care, housing and public safety, but they also wanted a government that would listen. “The message I took from the election and the narrow majority was that people wanted us to get on with this work, but they also wanted us to consider other perspectives.” Those are nice words, but the fact remains that Mr. Eby has hit the mute button on the Official Opposition until February, since he has decided there is no rush to convene the legislature and let the province’s MLAs get to work. That contrasts both with B.C.’s recent political history, and other provinces. It took fewer than six weeks for the NDP government to deliver a Throne Speech after B.C.’s snap election in 2020. Saskatchewan voted on Oct. 28, and legislators there are already in the House debating a Throne Speech that lays out Premier Scott Moe’s agenda for change. Mr. Eby is not offside with the law, but the B.C. Constitution Act sets a very low bar for attending the people’s House: The chamber cannot be vacant for more than one year. Meanwhile, there are matters that do require attention since the provincial government went into hiatus for the fall election campaign. British Columbians who have struggled with the rising cost of living were promised “immediate” relief if the NDP won re-election. That relief is to take the form of a middle-class tax cut, but the NDP platform noted such a measure would take more than a year to deliver. So in the interim, there would be a $1,000 payment per household delivered early next year. Mr. Eby acknowledges the measure, which will cost an estimated $1.8-billion, will require legislation. Because the legislature is not returning this fall, those cheques will not be delivered before March at the earliest. Access to health care was a major election issue, and the NDP have said they will move to address emergency room closings and the shortage of family doctors. The BC College of Family Physicians says B.C. can’t wait until the legislature returns in February to take action. Meanwhile, the looming trade dispute with the United States may have a profound impact on the B.C. economy. John Rustad, leader of the opposition Conservative party, wants the House recalled now for an emergency session to debate solutions, and to speed the grocery rebate on its way. Mr. Eby was quick to dismiss the request. But voters sent a strong opposition to Victoria. They deserve to be heard. Mr. Eby says his government is busy at work, even if its actions are not visible to the public. “We’ve got a bunch of new ministers that are learning their ministries, and are coming up to speed,” he said by way of explaining the delay. The more plausible reason for dragging his heels, however, is the behind-the-scenes negotiations with the two-member Green caucus. Mr. Eby hasn’t assigned his cabinet ministers mandate letters yet, hoping to craft their assignments to please the Greens, whose support would ease the burden of governing with a bare majority of 47 seats. But courting the Greens is not the priority for British Columbians, and that should not be getting in the way moving forward after such a long period in limbo. The NDP have governed B.C. for the past seven years. Mr. Eby has many veteran cabinet ministers to lean on. The challenges his government are tackling are not new. In fact, his 64-page election platform offers many solutions to stimulate housing, to hire more family doctors and to help make life more affordable for British Columbians. Mr. Eby needs to get on with it.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,The Editorial Board,The Globe and Mail,"Dec 2, 2024",Emergency medical care; State elections; Legislatures; Voters,,2024-12-02,The Globe and Mail
