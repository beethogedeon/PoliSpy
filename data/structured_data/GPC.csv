Canadian Stage to produce Harris’s controversial Slave Play at Berkeley Street Theatre,2025,"Canadian Stage will produce the Canadian premiere of Slave Play, American playwright Jeremy O.
Harris’s controversial work about race, sex and power dynamics, this fall.
Set on a Virginia plantation, the play follows three interracial couples as they undergo “antebellum sexual performance therapy,” which consists of roleplaying exercises that see the partners pretend to be slaves and owners.
Though Slave Play prominently features simulated sex acts, the critically acclaimed work is less about sex and more about power and desire, as well as the intersectional tapestry of racism that continues to loom over the United States.
Slave Play premiered at New York Theatre Workshop in 2018 before transferring to Broadway in 2019 and earning 12 Tony nominations. The play has since been revived in New York, Los Angeles and London. The Canadian Stage production, directed by associate artistic director Jordan Laffrenier, will mark Slave Play‘s first voyage over the Canadian border.
“I saw Slave Play when it opened offBroadway, and I knew I wanted to direct it right away,” Laffrenier said. “So much of the story is about the ways race and sex collide; I’m interested in the play aspect of Slave Play, and how through desire we can act out fantasies and learn more about ourselves and one another.”
“We’re super proud to have Jordan helming this,” artistic director Brendan Healy said. The Canadian Stage production, set to play the Berkeley Street Theatre from Sept. 27 to Oct. 19, will feature an all-Canadian cast and creative team, he added, though casting details remain to be announced.
While Slave Play was on Broadway, Harris spearheaded the first “Black Out Nights,” or performances geared exclusively toward Black audiences. At the time, Harris said he hoped these special performances would result in “more representation of Black bodies, both onstage and off.”
Since Slave Play‘s Broadway run, a handful of theatre companies – including Canadian Stage – have produced Black Out Nights of their own, often to a swarm of controversy.
In 2023, a Black Out Night for the National Arts Centre presentation of Canadian Stage, Obsidian Theatre and Necessary Angel’s co-production of Is God Is by Aleshea Harris drew criticism from right-wing media outlets, with some commentators calling the practice “cultural apartheid.”
Former British prime minister Rishi Sunak also expressed concern about Black Out Nights when Slave Play ran on London’s West End in 2024, saying that “restricting audiences on the basis of race would be wrong and divisive.”
According to Healy, it has not yet been decided whether the Toronto run will include Black Out Nights. “We’re evaluating community interest and need,” he said.
Canadian Stage has long produced work by non-Canadian playwrights, including recent American heavy hitters such as The Inheritance and Fat Ham.
With a trade war heating up, however, some Canadians have called on local arts institutions to focus on producing work by Canadian playwrights. Slave Play‘s Harris, raised in Martinsville, Va., is American.
Healy’s take is that artists should “stay open to the world” in times of geopolitical fear and distrust – especially a company such as Canadian Stage, which continues to carry an “internationalist” approach to programming.
“We are an anchor theatre inside a global city,” he said. “When we do nonCanadian work, we try to prioritize voices that are unique and necessary, that offer important perspectives. Jeremy straddles a number of communities that are currently being threatened south of the border. There’s an imperative for us to give space to those voices in response to the current geopolitical situation.”
Laffrenier agreed. “Even as a Canadian, this show feels relevant to my own history of being a person whose family has been very wounded by slavery on both sides,” he said. “The history of slavery is very present in Canada, and I think that’s true of the story of many Torontonians.
“Slave Play is a story about love,” he added. “And about how history shapes the present moment.”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Murphy, Aisling",The Globe and Mail,"Mar 22, 2025",Stage production; Artistic directors; Geopolitics; Theater; Slavery; Dramatists,

"Second set of remains in Winnipeg-area landfill search identified as Marcedes Myran:   Manitoba government confirms findings shortly after the remains of another victim, Morgan Harris, were identified",2025,"Manitoba has identified a second set of human remains at a Winnipeg-area landfill, confirming that they belong to one of two First Nations women whose bodies the province has been searching for at the site since last year.
In a statement Monday, the Manitoba government said investigators at the Prairie Green landfill have matched human remains to Marcedes Myran, one of four women murdered in 2022 by a serial killer who was convicted for the crimes last summer.
Earlier this month, the province identified a first set of remains found at the site in late February as those belonging to Morgan Harris, another one of the victims.
""Marcedes Myran we honour you,"" Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said Monday in a short statement posted to social media.
Manitoba has been searching for the remains since last fall at Prairie Green, just north of Winnipeg in the Rural Municipality of Rosser, a multiyear effort that the provincial and federal governments have each committed $20-million toward.
In August last year, after a months-long trial, Jeremy Skibicki, then 37, was sentenced to life in prison for the first-degree murders of 39-year-old Ms. Harris, 26-year-old Ms. Myran, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois and a yet-to-be-identified woman whom First Nations elders have named Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman.
After the killer’s arrest in May of 2022, Winnipeg police had located some of the remains of Ms. Contois, a member of Crane River First Nation, at a separate landfill. But while police obtained GPS information to confirm that the bodies of Ms. Myran and Ms. Harris, both from Long Plain First Nation, were at Prairie Green, they opted not to conduct a search of that landfill.
Police said the Prairie Green search would be too dangerous.

A small and overdue step in Manitoba toward dignity and reconciliation:   The delay of police and politicians in launching a search for the remains of Morgan Harris and other Indigenous women was an insult piled on top of their families’ grief.,2025,"Morgan Harris has, finally, come home. The Indigenous woman was one of four murdered by a serial killer and her body lay nearly three years in a dump near Winnipeg. For a time, it looked as though this indignity would be eternal. Police ducked calls to search the landfill and the provincial government used the situation to score political points.
This was a betrayal. It was insult piled upon grief for her family, which is understandably in no mood to forgive.
A change of government finally led to a search. And remains found recently were identified last week as belonging to Ms. Harris. Other remains have also been unearthed at the site but not yet identified. The family of Marcedes Myran, another of the killer’s victims, is hoping this will turn out to be their daughter.
Finding these women is a crucial step in their families’ recovery. It’s also a small step along Canada’s road toward reconciliation with Indigenous people, and one that should never have taken this long.
Jeremy Skibicki was sentenced last year to life in prison for murdering Ms. Harris and Ms. Myran, along with Rebecca Contois and another woman who has not been identified. He targeted women in homeless shelters, lured them to his apartment, assaulted them, killed them and defiled their bodies, which he then dumped in the garbage.
After arresting him, in May of 2022, Winnipeg police kept secret their conclusion that Ms. Harris and Ms. Myran had ended up in the Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg. They allowed the families to keep hoping for months their loved ones were alive, to go on searching for them.
Police later responded to graffiti critical of their inaction by referring it to their major crimes unit.
Once police acknowledged they thought the bodies were at Prairie Green, they refused to look for them, claiming dangerous material such as asbestos made it too risky. But police are not the ones trained to assess such risks.
The police claim was then taken up by the Progressive Conservative government of Heather Stefanson, which argued it would be irresponsibly dangerous to search the landfill. A worst-case cost estimate – $184-million if the search took three years – was treated as gospel. Doing the right thing for these families was crassly weighed against what else that money could buy.
The Tories turned the families’ pain into an ugly wedge issue during a 2023 provincial election, insisting they were doing the right thing by doing nothing. In the last days of the campaign they even paid for large billboards touting the supposed virtue of not undertaking the search.
These families were treated callously by the police and cynically by the government.
It’s easy to say the right words when it comes to reconciliation. The actual work is harder, and it centres on respect. Reconciliation is made more difficult by torching trust with the Indigenous community. It requires humility. It requires empathy.
Canadians have to see the pain and suffering of Indigenous people as being important. When the families of these women were crying out for justice, police and government made it clear that their loved ones didn’t matter.
Only after Wab Kinew led the NDP to victory in that 2023 election, having promised to search the landfill, did the necessary work begin. While excavation continues, the search has so far been much faster and cheaper than forecast. And even if it does drag on it would still have been the right thing to do.
In the Manitoba legislature last week, current Tory Leader Wayne Ewasko admitted as much, saying his party had ""lost our way in regards to empathy and also lost our way in regards to closure being brought forward to the families of the victims.""
It can be too easy for other Canadians to look away from the suffering of Indigenous people. But their reality – a shorter life span, far too many of them in prison, urban homelessness and dozens of reserves with boil-water advisories – is a stain on the nation. Ignoring it just compounds this.
True reconciliation may take decades, though there will be moments along the way that show progress is being made. Recognizing the importance of searching the landfill was one such marker. Finding Morgan Harris, and giving back the dignity she deserved by returning her to her family, was another.

"Remains found in Winnipeg-area landfill search confirmed to belong to Morgan Harris:   A second set of remains have also been discovered at the site, but have not been identified, the government said Friday",2025,"The Manitoba RCMP have identified the human remains found at a Winnipeg-area landfill as those belonging to one of at least two First Nations women that the province has been searching for at the site.

The province said Ms. Harris’s family has been notified and is asking for privacy.
The government added Friday that there is also a second set of remains recovered at the site, which have not yet been identified.
Manitoba has been searching for the remains at a targeted section of Prairie Green, just north of Winnipeg in the Rural Municipality of Rosser, since last fall. Last week, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew told The Globe and Mail that the RCMP and Manitoba’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner had been tasked to identify the remains that workers uncovered from thousands of cubic metres of detritus.
In August last year, after a months-long trial, Jeremy Skibicki, then 37, was sentenced to life in prison for the first-degree murders of 39-year-old Ms. Harris, 26-year-old Marcedes Myran, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois and a yet-to-be-identified woman whom First Nations elders have named Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman.

Police said the Prairie Green search would be too dangerous. That decision became the flashpoint issue of Manitoba’s election in 2023, with the PC Party at the time paying for billboards, radio ads and newspaper spots to tell voters that ""the answer on the landfill dig just has to be no."" But Mr. Kinew’s New Democrats, who eventually won the election, argued that the search was the humane thing to do.
Earlier this week, PC Opposition Leader Wayne Ewasko formally apologized for the first time to the families of the four women at the Manitoba legislature.

MLA refers to Holocaust in defence of residential schools post; Green party deputy leader calls comment 'very disturbing and shocking',2025,"A Progressive Conservative MLA is defending a controversial social media post she made about the residential school system by referencing the Holocaust.
On Friday, Albert-Riverview MLA Sherry Wilson spoke to media for the first time about the Facebook post that drew calls from some Indigenous leaders for her to be removed as a PC candidate in the fall provincial election.
In that post, Wilson appeared to draw a comparison between protections for LGBTQ+ students under the province's original gender-identity policy and the federal program aimed at stripping Indigenous children of their culture and language through residential schools.
In her post, Wilson wrote that the residential school system ""was only allowed to happen because children enrolled in school were isolated from their parents' oversight, input and influence.""
""We cannot afford to repeat the tragic mistakes that destroyed the lives of thousands of Indigenous families,"" she wrote in her post. ""Therefore, I am committed to keeping the parents of minor children aware of, and involved in, their children's development while they are entrusted to our government schools.""
Wilson told Brunswick News Friday that it wasn't her intention to draw a comparison between the original Policy 713 and the residential school system, and that the media misconstrued her post.
Instead, she offered an explanation for why she decided to make a public call on the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to make sure history doesn't repeat itself.
""The intention of it was because when you go to the Holocaust memorials, that's one of the things they'll always say, 'Let's talk about it, so it never happens again,'"" she said.
Six million Jewish people died at the hands of the Nazi German regime and its allies during the Holocaust, which occurred between 1933 and 1945.
Green party Deputy Leader Megan Mitton said Friday she was stunned to hear Wilson reference the Holocaust when the PC MLA was asked about Policy 713 and her post about residential schools.
""I find this very disturbing and shocking to bring the Holocaust into this discussion when residential schools already should not have been brought into this discussion,"" Mitton said. ""Frankly, this discussion should never have happened - this discussion of rolling back inclusion policies, particularly for non-binary and trans students, should never have happened and was definitely fueled by hateful rhetoric.""
Brunswick News requested comment from Premier Susan Holt through her office and did not receive a response as of deadline.
In 2023, the former Higgs PC government put in place a new parental consent requirement for trans and non-binary students under the age of 16 who wished to go by names and pronouns that reflected their gender identity. The policy change required school staff to obtain parental consent in order to informally use the preferred names and pronouns of these students.
The new requirement was championed by then premier Blaine Higgs and education minister Bill Hogan, both of whom spoke about their concerns with schools keeping secrets from parents under their government's original version of Policy 713.
But the PCs' revised policy was met with a flurry of protests, petitions and lawsuits, as well as turmoil within the party.
""It's so unfortunate that there couldn't have been a coming together with New Brunswickers on (the PCs' revised Policy 713) because I really believe that it was made into something that it wasn't at all,"" Wilson said Friday.
On the campaign trail this fall, Higgs decided to keep Wilson on as a candidate after her residential school post was condemned by Indigenous leaders, the Liberals and the Greens.
The post was eventually taken down because ""it didn't meet the mark and it was interpreted differently,"" Higgs later told reporters.
Wilson told Brunswick News Friday that the misinterpretation of her social media post by the media was ""probably one of the worst experiences I ever had.""
""What was more upsetting for me was I working directly with an Indigenous lady and she told me, 'Sherry, we know your heart, so don't worry about that. We know that wasn't your intention,'"" Wilson said.
""Other people - they took it seriously and believed it. It was a very difficult time because it was totally not what was intended.""
After a landslide win for the Liberals this fall, the new Holt government revised Policy 713, returning the right of all students - regardless of age or gender identity - to informally go by their chosen names and pronouns at school without parental consent.
Days after the Liberals' win, in a social media post, Wilson, who was reelected for a fifth term, blamed the ""liberal media"" for her residential school post being ""twisted"" during the election campaign.
Wilson said Friday she has already received complaints from some parents about the Liberals' revised Policy 713 that came into effect Jan. 1.
""A lot of the parents' rights groups have spoken with me and they are concerned about it as well because we want our kids to grow up to be happy, wholesome adults and be happy within their own bodies,"" she said.

Possible human remains found in search of Manitoba landfill:   Authorities have been searching for the bodies of serial-killer victims Marcedes Myran and Morgan Harris,2025,"Manitoba has found what are believed to be human remains at a Winnipeg-area landfill where the province has been searching for the bodies of at least two First Nations women dumped by a convicted serial killer.
In a statement late Wednesday, the Manitoba government said experts on site at the Prairie Green landfill have identified potential human remains in the search material.
The province said that the RCMP and Manitoba’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner are now investigating the matter and will work to identify the remains.
In early December, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew told The Globe and Mail that a targeted section of the Prairie Green landfill had then been pinpointed as the most probable location of the bodies of 26-year-old Marcedes Myran and 39-year-old Morgan Harris.
After a months-long trial last year, 37-year-old Jeremy Skibicki was sentenced to life for the first-degree murders of Ms. Myran, Ms. Harris, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois and an unidentified woman whom First Nations elders have named Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman.
In 2022, Winnipeg police had located some of the remains of Ms. Contois, a member of Crane River First Nation, at a separate landfill shortly after the killer’s arrest in May of that year. But remains of the other three women had never been found.
The bodies of Ms. Myran and Ms. Harris, both from Long Plain First Nation, are believed to have been dumped at Prairie Green, based on GPS information obtained by police from several garbage trucks. But Winnipeg police had not conducted a search of the landfill, considering it too dangerous.
The province said on Wednesday that the families of Ms. Harris and Ms. Myran have been notified about the new development and have attended the site. The government is asking to respect for their privacy at this time.

Make Laurentian University Ontario's mining champion; Ontario election It's one of David Robinson's four pillars as the Green Party candidate for the Sudbury riding,2025,"Note: The Sudbury Star has given candidates running in the Sudbury and Nickel Belt ridings the chance to submit a column about why they are running and their priorities if elected. Here, David Robinson of the Green Party lays out his reasons for running.
My job as Sudbury's Green candidate is to get climate change on your agenda and convince you it is part of a real economic development strategy for our city.
My job as your MPP would be to bring together political factions and leading institutions in the city in a unified campaign to get what Sudbury needs. No other candidate has the knowledge, experience or the proven record of working for Sudbury. No other candidate has the contacts and the respect in every corner of the city.
Star readers can look up ""Dr. David Robinson, Sudbury"" with Google. They will discover that I am the father of Sudbury's architecture school, the person who identified and first promoted our mighty and growing mining supply sector, who has done briefings for the Greater Sudbury Chamber of Commerce, consulted for First Nations communities and other northern communities, helped found Gallery 6500 in the Steelworkers hall, played a key role in bringing Sudbury's PlaySmeter Festival to the city.
They will find that I am the father of three, grandfather of two, married for 44 years, and a longtime climate activist. They find my columns in The Star, in Northern Ontario Business Magazine, or the Republic of Mining website and my two books.
They will see someone with a wide knowledge and a wider set of connections that I can use on Sudbury's behalf if I am MPP.
I won't talk here about our solid Green platform, although I helped write parts of it.
I won't explain how Doug Ford has failed on every major provincial portfolio, although, as an economist, I can make that case pretty easily.
I'll just lay out my four provincial-level priorities for Sudbury.
First, make Laurentian University Ontario's mining champion. The world needs the critical minerals we have in Northern Ontario. The mines won't be in Sudbury. How do we capture a big share of the money these minerals generate? I would work with city council, the university and others to bring more mining-related research and teaching to Sudbury's university and colleges. This is Sudbury's biggest economic development opportunity.
Success would support the growth of the mining supply and services sector, the main economic driver for Greater Sudbury. It is the only way we can capture a share of the coming critical minerals boom for Sudbury.
The key is to build sustained and unified local political pressure.
Second, attract talent by being a climate champion and a safe climate refuge. Sudbury is in a kind of climate sweet spot. If we make the right moves now, Sudbury will look like heaven to people in places facing rapid and devastating climate change. Talent drives the economy. We can target talented climate refugees from around the world and the USA.
Third, save everyone money. Sudburians spend close to half a billion dollars a year on fossil fuels. We can cut that cost by two-thirds by helping people convert to heat pumps and electric vehicles. Make the choice easy and let the wallets talk.
Fourth, fix the city's finances. Cities are creatures of the province. The province has been downloading costs and responsibilities onto the property tax bill. It is time to download some of the province's revenues. Cities should get most of the fuel tax and part of the HST. We need property tax reform to make the system fairer and more efficient.
These are all provincial issues. Other candidates are not talking about them because they don't understand them. They don't remember how ambitious and powerful the people of Sudbury are when they work together. We can be powerful again.
Also running in Sudbury are Jamie West (Sudbury), who currently holds the seat for the NDP, Max Massimiliano (PCs), Rashid Mukhtar Choudhry (Liberals), Brady Legault (New Blue Party) and David Popescu (Independent.) sud.editorial@sunmedia.ca Bluesky: @sudburystar.bsky.social X: @SudburyStar","Sudbury Star; Sudbury, Ont.","Sudbury, Ont.","Robinson, David",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 25, 2025",Economic development; Mining; Critical minerals; Climate change; Property taxes; Elections; Northern communities,Nom: Laurentian University; NAICS: 611310
Kingston and the Islands Green Party candidate Zachary Typhair,2025,"More than a decade ago, Kingston and the Islands was one of the ridings where the Ontario Green Party had high hopes of getting elected.
With Bridget Doherty and Robert Kiley, two candidates who would later go on to win city council seats, the party peaked with more than eight per cent of the vote in the 2007 election.
In 2014, Kiley won more than seven per cent of the vote.
But despite the hopes, the local candidates did not break out of single digit vote percentages, let alone challenge for the win.
Zachary Typhair, the Green Party's candidate this time around, worked on all of those campaigns and said the party's message is still resonating with Kingston voters.
""It's incredible, actually,"" he said. ""We're getting support across the political spectrum right now at the doors, and I think it's because conservatives don't feel like they're at home.
""The Ford government lost $340 million from the federal funding because they couldn't hit their housing targets. That's not responsible.""
Typhair said the Green Party's environmental message remains the same, albeit with a few tweaks to address the current political landscape.
With a looming trade war with the United States, a threat Premier Doug Ford used as the pretext for the entire election, Typhair said the Green's environmentalist roots can help protect Ontario from tariffs.
""The Greens are going to invest into local,"" he said. ""We're going to ensure that local business can get ahead because right now we're supporting big corporations and that's what you get with the other parties.
""We're the only party calling to break up the grocery monopolies. You want to know why food prices are going up? It's because we allow these monopolies to take control, declare what the price is, and small business owners can't compete.""
Typhair said the party pledged to make it easier to build four-unit housing developments without needing to go through a lengthy zoning process, something many politicians and municipalities have been moving toward.
""It's definitely slow work,"" Typhair said of efforts to create more housing.

1975: FRANCO HARRIS CHOSEN SUPER BOWL MVP,2025,"For more than 100 years, photographers and photo editors working for The Globe and Mail have preserved an extraordinary collection of news photography. Every Monday, The Globe features one of these images. This month, in honour of Black History Month and the Super Bowl, we’re looking at Black players, coaches and staff who broke the NFL’s colour barrier.
Franco Harris, born to an African-American father and an Italian mother, was one of the most beloved athletes in Pittsburgh history.
Mr. Harris, a 6-foot-2 fleet-of-foot running back, was one of the heroes of the great Steelers dynasty, with whom he won four Super Bowls. But the Hall-of-Famer was known primarily for two games.
The first was in the 1972 NFL playoffs, when he caught a ricocheted ball thrown by Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw and stunningly ran 60 yards for the winning touchdown with 22 seconds left.
The play was so remarkable it was dubbed “the immaculate reception” and is considered one of the greatest plays in NFL history. Another game in which Mr. Harris starred was Super Bowl 9. In Pittsburgh’s win over Minnesota, Mr. Harris rushed for 158 yards and was chosen the game’s most-valuable player – the first African-American (and ItalianAmerican) to win the award.

GoFundMe created to help curler Harris cover legal fees:   Team Einarson lead exonerated of doping charges,2025,"Petersfield residents have launched a GoFundMe campaign on behalf of local professional curler Briane Harris to help ease the financial hardship she has endured fighting her ban from competitive curling.
Harris, a four-time Canadian champion lead with Kerri Einarson’s team, served a provisional suspension that dragged on 11 months after testing positive for trace amounts of an illegal substance, Ligandrol, a year ago.
Harris finally won her appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport last month — it ruled she bore no fault or negligence for being exposed to the banned substance, which her husband passed along — but was left with thousands of dollars in legal fees.
The idea to raise money had been floated a few times as people learned of the hefty bill Harris incurred, but it never got off the ground until Dianne Grocholski, a longtime family friend, acted on it.
The GoFundMe page opened last weekend and had raised $7,675 by press time Wednesday. Grocholski has set a goal of $40,000.
“They’re a young family just starting out… and then, of course, she’s expecting a second child right now, as well. They’re just trying to make it like everybody else, and all of a sudden, the rug is pulled out from under them completely, (through) no fault of her own,” Grocholski said. “To me, it’s like, here’s this woman that’s our champion… and all of a sudden this happens, and we’re supposed to have her back.
“It’s been huge, the impact on her emotionally and her family, and financially, it’s been huge, far more than anybody would even imagine. I just think she needs support.”
Harris, who is seven months pregnant, is not one to ask others for help, but has been open about the toll the suspension and legal proceedings had on her and her family.
“I can admit, it does make me a little uncomfortable since asking for/accepting help is not natural for me. But at the same time, I am immensely and enormously grateful for every penny that has been donated to help my family,” Harris said in a written statement to the Free Press .
“This case has put a huge strain on us in many ways, and we’re still trying to get to the other side of it. To every single generous, amazing person who has donated to help us — thank you so much. It is beyond appreciated.”
The past year has been hellish for Harris as she learned about her suspension on the eve of the 2024 women’s national championship.
She appealed the decision in August but then had to wait another five months before finding out her appeal was successful. During the whole process, she was prohibited from communicating with team members and could not set foot on a curling rink while banned.
In January, shortly after receiving the first piece of good news in months, Harris was delivered another setback when she was told the team would not be returning her to the regular lineup or as an alternate for the national championship, which begins Friday in Thunder Bay, Ont.
Team Einarson stated it wanted to maintain a consistent lineup heading into the biggest event of the year and the team had already locked in its alternate player before hearing Harris had been exonerated appeal. The Gimli-based team will run with third Val Sweeting, recently acquired second Karlee Burgess and Krysten Karwacki, who has filled in at lead during Harris’s absence.
While Harris waits to hear about her future with the team, having some or all of her legal fees covered would be a welcomed change of fortune.
“She’s earned our respect,” said Grocholski. “For this to have happened to her is very strange, because she is so particular. She’s very methodical about everything she does and how she does it.
“I know there is so much more to this story than what the average person knows, and I do believe that someday Briane… will say a little bit more, but when I say she’s walking on pins and needles, she’s hoping she still has a career in curling by the fall and she doesn’t know what’s going to happen with her team.”

"A love letter to love letters:   As Valentine’s Day approaches, putting pen to paper is a small act of defiance against our craven consumer culture, Michael Harris writes. We begin to think beyond the emoji world’s unlikely ‘hearts’ and instead, we give our feelings their space, their time and their due",2025,"Michael Harris is the author of several books, including Solitude: A Singular Life in a Crowded World and The End of Absence: Reclaiming What We’ve Lost in a World of Constant Connection.
None of us know much about love but most of us know this: It’s easier to desire that which is out of reach. So stubborn is that truth that it permeates even the legend of the very first valentine. It was a love poem, they say, written by a 15thcentury prince imprisoned in the Tower of London.
We like the story of inaccessible love so much that we won’t let real history get in the way. The prince, Charles d’Orléans, was not, in fact, imprisoned when he wrote his famous poem. He was safe and sound in France. Nor was he writing to a special love but, rather, to a woman “assigned” to be his valentine through an ornate courtly ritual. D’Orléans explicitly rejects her in the poem and protests that he’s too frail for any shenanigans.
So, the legend reflects our blind belief in the supremacy of thwarted romance. It’s conjured by our collective need for pining lovers who struggle to pass each other notes.
Today, we are starved for such starvation.
Any modern love is annotated not by hard-to-send love letters but by easy-to-send glyphs – a suggestive emoji, perhaps, or (dare to dream) a text asking: “you up?” There’s no need for more when the lover in question has already texted you six times that day and shared a photo of their awesome latte.
The problem is not how to reach a potential lover but how to mute them. The majority of those aged 18 to 29 now use dating apps where they swipe at avatars with the lust of online shopping – it’s that rapid-fire and that instinctive. Ultimately, because these are really messaging apps at their core, users end up turning themselves into issuers of scattershot, two-second love letters.
Quantitative changes (the move, say, from one handwritten love letter to a thousand “sup” DMs) eventually have qualitative effects. On dating apps, for example, lovers who are trying to broadcast some signal about their most intimate desires find themselves in a middling space between disconnection and connection. Everywhere online – but on these apps in particular – we live in a shallow middle, never braving the cold of solitude nor the risk of real intimacy.
One app, called Volar, takes all this to the nth degree. It allows two AI-generated avatars to chat amongst themselves, serving as digital stand-ins for their human counterparts. The humans are simply informed after the fact whether the conversation sparkled. In this way, the act of writing love letters may finally boil off into a gas. An unnoticed, algorithmic process will take the labour of literary courtship entirely out of human hands.

We begin to believe that our love is defined by online interfaces, that the speed and heartlessness of our technologies are ours as well.
But this is a mistake.
A far greater gauge of love, of course, is the care we confer on the objects of our affection. Do we give them our best? Do we give them our full and awestruck attention? Or do we, in the hours when we might describe our love in full, instead grow dull and limited; do we allow our expressive ambitions to be hobbled down to the kind of dopamine-triggering nuggets that attract not a person but a following.
Nobody chooses, of course, to downgrade their affection in this way. Rather, I’m describing a cannibalization of love letters by a larger online experience. All online life is designed by attention merchants (Meta, TikTok, etc.) to be instantly consumable. And any message of love that’s handled by their profit-driven platforms must, therefore, be twisted into a throwaway thing.
Reclaiming the art of writing love letters – on the antique technology of paper – is a small act of defiance, a safeguarding of the self against tech giants that want to package and sell you. It’s a preserving not just of love’s deeper value, but of love’s separation from craven consumer culture.
What is a love letter, though?
What makes it work?
Love letters are self-limiting.
Their one-person audience and time-consuming creation are anathema to the twin goals of our time – virality and speed. Yet those limits are also their superpower – they teach us to care.
Love letters force us to craft our effusions, to consider, rewrite and hone. We begin to think beyond the emoji world’s unlikely “hearts” and heartless “likes.” Instead, we give our feelings their space, their time and their due.
Next, these careful thoughts are cured in the silent interval between composition and delivery, like paint on a canvas. When we receive a love letter, we receive with it the patina that only a physical object can achieve; we apprehend a romantic reality as opposed to merely being harassed by some flashing sentiment. All the DMs in the world cannot ground us so well as a simple, tactile record of another’s affection.
For much of history we didn’t have to go looking for such a record. Letter writing was for many generations a given – so basic and commonplace that author Simon Garfield, in his book To the Letter, called it “the great discursive template” of our world. But that template has been rusted and chipped by a series of inventions. Samuel Morse sent his first telegraph message in 1844; with wise apprehension, the first note he tapped out read “What hath God wrought?”
And God kept wrought-ing: In time we flung ourselves through telephones, pagers, fax machines, e-mails, text messages … Each generation of technology squeezed a little more dopamine from our brains, delighted our drive for social grooming; and merchants learned to harness that chemical reaction, lure us in and commercialize the most intimate corners of human communication.
Until, after years of chatting, swiping, nudging, pinging, maybe the whole idea of writing to each other is at last drying up. Half of women now tell Pew Research that they’ve grown fatigued by dating app messages. And can it really be a coincidence the first generation to come of age on dating apps are also having far less sex?
We are, in the end, dissatisfied because the equation for human desire includes an element of distance – and distance is the one thing our devices cannot offer. We frown at our buzzing phones and long for a poem from a prisoner in a tower.
We each suspect – even while thumbing out another harried eggplant emoji – that there’s something more we wanted to say, some finer sensibility that we are meant to share. We’re sure it’s there, just beyond the glare of all that common, easy messaging. A love letter is the tool we have for revealing that finer sensibility. It’s an old but necessary tool – sure and irreplaceable as a chisel or vise. An unsurpassed means of mapping the depths.
Our messaging platforms feel especially dreary around Valentine’s Day, I think. Not because they fail to deliver but because they deliver too well. We glance away from our phones, hoping distractedly for proof that a person – that one person – has sat down for a stretch of time and cared. How long can we bear to wait before glancing down again?","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Harris, Michael",The Globe and Mail,"Feb 8, 2025",Dating services; Writing; Dopamine; Letters,
QUEEN'S GAELS WIN FOURTH STRAIGHT CARR-HARRIS CUP GAME OVER RMC,2025,"The Queen's Gaels secured a fourth straight Carr-Harris Cup Challenge with a 5-2 win over the rival Royal Military College Paladins on Thursday night at Slush Puppie Place.
Nolan Hutcheson, with a pair of goals, Daniel Michaud, Samuel Marburg and Cameron Tolnai scored as Queen's top-ranked Ontario University Athletics power play scored three times in the win. The Gaels (20-5-0), who jumped into a first-place tie in the OUA standings with the W, built a 4-0 lead by the midway point of the second en route to their fourth straight victory.
Isaac Pascoal and Nathan Fox replied for the Paladins (1-24-0) as the clubs played the Carr-Harris game for the 37th time.
Christian Purboo stopped 16 of 18 shots in the win, while RMC's stopped 26 of 31 shots in the loss.
The Carr-Harris cup was initiated by the International Hockey Hall of Fame to celebrate the longstanding hockey rivalry between RMC and Queen's and is named in honour of the Carr-Harris family.
Before the game, Queen's Owen Lalonde and RMC's Mathieu Hébert received the J.W (Bill) Fitsell Memorial Award in recognition of their outstanding performance as graduating athletes. After the match, Hutcheson was honoured as the Gael's MVP for his two goals and one assist.","Kingston Whig - Standard; Kingston, Ont.","Kingston, Ont.","Murphy, Jan",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 8, 2025",,
Sask. weaving artist honoured; New exhibit puts the spotlight on Harris's groundbreaking work; Sask. weaving artist honoured; New exhibit puts the spotlight on Harris's groundbreaking work,2025,"Kaija Sanelma Harris created her world in textile, painting Prairie landscapes and memories of her native Finland in lines of interlaced thread back and forth across the loom.
""Shewasaworld-classweaverinternationally known - and the best weaver I've ever known,"" says Saskatchewan-based textile artist Jude Haraldson. ""Her colour sense was astounding, her design sense was amazing and her technical skill was astounding.""
Because she was both an expert crafter and a trail-blazing artist of her era, Harris's work often lived in a quiet space between these two creative worlds. After her death in 2022 at the age of 82, curators at the Saskatchewan Craft Council and the Remai Modern gallery in Saskatoon have collaborated on their first joint exhibition to showcase her work. It was time, they agreed, for one of Saskatche- wan's most inventive and boundary-breaking artists to get her due.
""Kaija was incredibly prolific, but she made her contributions quietly, on the sidelines, because she was a craft artist and a textile artist,"" said Saskatchewan Craft Council exhibition co-ordinator Leah Moxley Teigrob.
""She wasn't necessarily recognized in the same way as some of the painters of that time. So it's important to bring her work into context, and to talk about her legacy in the craft and art communities in Saskatoon.""
To help people understand what made Harris's work so unique and how her influence continues to shape textile art in Canada today, Haraldson has been demonstrating some of Harris's techniques to gallery visitors.
""I started by demonstrating basic weaving, because a lot of people don't know where their clothes come from - so understanding the simple, basic weaving is key,"" she said.
""Basically, weaving is threads going over and under each other. One set is the warp threads - they'reusuallyheldinplace,in order, and it can be on something as simple as a frame that you wrap it around - and the other set is the weft threads."" From those two basic principles, Harris built her designs with colours and textures and patterns, adding three-dimensional designs like clusters of birch trees framing the cloth landscape or woven pockets that she could then use to create stained-glass-like effects with colour gels or to join other pieces of woven or felted cloth into geometric tapestries.
She would sketch her designs in pencil, so she could see how the colours would overlap without bleeding into one another - ""in weaving, colours don't blend like paint; they pixelate. Weaving always shows the other yarn,"" Haraldson explained - and worked one line at a time, tying handfuls of different wool onto her loom to make the cut-diamond skylines and organic textures that would become an iconic part of her style.
""Visiting her in her house, her studio was very simple,"" Haraldson recalled. ""She had a lot of yarn and two big looms, which were back to back with each other.
""Seeing her drawings and her looms, you can understand how she did these amazing pieces, where it looks like one complex colour when you step back and when you come close you can see all the structure in it.
""She concentrated a lot on her work - she was meticulous, very planned and precise - and it was what she loved doing.""
At first, when Remai Modern and the Craft Council were planning their joint exhibition, they had thought each gallery would feature a different side of Harris's work; the Craft Council could highlight her technique, while the Remai would showcase her place in Saskatchewan's art history.
But Michelle Jacques, Remai Modern's chief curator, says that kind of clear binary simply didn't exist in Harris's pieces.
""It was impossible to do that, because that was just not the way she operated,"" said Jaques.
""For people to really engage with her work, we need to talk about technique. She was such a stickler for technique, having been trained in Sweden in these very traditional and precise approaches to weaving. But when she came to Saskatchewan, her first community here was the painting community, and she talks about the inspiration for her work in very much the same way that the painters of that time talk about being inspired.""
And fully recognizing the ways Harris redefined the rules of her craft shouldn't mean putting an asterisk on her place in art history, Moxley Teigrob adds.
""We wanted to connect some of her functional work - like the blankets we have on display - with pieces like these incredible tapestries that took months and months of planning and work to put together,"" she said. ""These are both valid pieces of artwork, made by the same artist. ""A conversation that's always happening around the Craft Council is about how we can make connections and bring attention to craft pieces at the same level of other types of fine art, because they are often disregarded, or seen as only functional, or seen as women's work.
""Kaija did not receive as much recognition as she should have, based on the quality of her work. Part of this whole exhibition is about bringing that to light and reminding people that she was here.""
Harris was a master of her field, but she was and is not the only person working at the intersection of art and craft, so bringing these creatives into the spotlight is an opportunity to tell a story of Saskatchewan art history that is vastly broader, deeper and more expansive than what has previously been featured on the gallery walls, Jacques says.
""Kaija was under-recognized and so, to an extent, this show is a discovery. But really, at one point, she was operating amongst the greatest textile artists working - and I think there probably are many other stories like hers.
""Artists who stay in Saskatchewan choose a different kind of life - it's a different kind of benefit - rather than going somewhere else where they might have more opportunities and more accolades.
""Definitely think there are more stories like this to be found and to be told. It's a reminder, to myself and to other people working in this field, that we need to do what we can to bring attention to the wealth of creativity and talent that exists here.""","Star - Phoenix; Saskatoon, Sask.","Saskatoon, Sask.","Peterson, Julia",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 4, 2025",Weaving; Painters; Artists; Art history; Councils; Tapestry; Textiles; Art exhibits; Painting,Nom: Remai Modern; NAICS: 712110
TIGERS BOLSTER BULLPEN WITH SIGNING OF KAHNLE; Harris not done tinkering with the lineup and looks to find more ways to get better,2025,"It's not the free-agent help Detroit Tigers fans were eyeing.
Most of the off-season watch with the Tigers has centred around free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman.
While Bregman remains on the market, the Tigers looked to beef up the team's bullpen by inking right-handed reliever Tommy Kahnle to a one-year deal for US$7.75 million.
""I think every organization in baseball is looking for pitching right now,"" Tigers' president of baseball operations Scott Harris said. ""So, there's a market for pitching clearly.
""We are excited to add Tommy because he induces an impressive combination of swing and miss and ground balls. He can get outs in multiple ways. He can handle righties and lefties and he gives our pen a different look.""
A change-up specialist, Kahnle is the second member of the American League champion New York Yankees to sign with Detroit along with infielder Gleyber Torres. He and right-hander Alex Cobb, who split last season between San Francisco and Cleveland, both inked one-year deals for $15 million.
""We're not done,"" said Harris, who did not discuss Bregman or former Tiger and free-agent starter Jack Flaherty. ""We're going to try and find new ways to make this team better. There's a number of ways we can do it. Free agency, trade, if we're talking about (Tigers' left-handed reliever) Tyler Holton, waiver claims also. But we're going to find ways to get better. Bullpen and our lineup are two areas that we are going to look to upgrade if we can.""
The 35-year-old Kahnle, who made his Major League Baseball debut in 2014, has been one of baseball's top relievers over the past two seasons after recovering from Tommy John surgery in 2020.
In 92 games with the Yankees the past two seasons, Kahnle allowed just 22 earned runs in 83 1/3 innings while walking 38 batters and striking out 93.
""He can handle righties (a career .206 batting average against) and lefties (a career .215 batting average against) and he gives our pen a different look,"" Harris said. ""We were looking for someone that can get outs in leverage spots and he has a history of doing that and he's performed as one of the better relievers in all of baseball over the last couple years. So, we're excited to add him to our group.""
Kahnle said he watched Detroit's remarkable late-season drive to make the playoffs last season and said watching the team's energy was part of what drew him to the Tigers.
""It seemed like the Tigers, early on, were very interested and they kind of maintained that interest throughout the process,"" said Kahnle, who said talks heated up in the last 10 days. ""They seemed like they showed the most interest.
""They were very high on me and what I could bring to the bullpen and so it just seemed like it was a good fit. They found something (last season), something clicked and it looked like a fun team and it looks like a good fit for me.""
While right-hander Jason Foley paced the Tigers with 28 saves last season, they had no official closer at the end of the year and Kahnle will likely go into a mix along with Foley, right-hander Beau Brieske, Holton and right-hander Will Vest. ""As far as how he fits at the end of games, he can pitch anywhere,"" Harris said of Kahnle. ""He's demonstrated in his career that he can get outs anywhere. I think we demonstrated as a team last year that we can get to the finish line in a number of different ways and I think that does give us an edge. How it all shakes out, I'm not quite sure, we're not done building our team yet.
""I think the way we pitched last year, especially in the pen, helps give us a bit of an edge and our players have spoken up about how some really like it.""
To make room on the 40-man roster for Kahnle, the Tigers designated right-hander Alex Faedo for assignment. The 29-year-old Faedo, who was a first-round pick by Detroit in 2017, appeared in 37 games for the Tigers last season and made six starts while going 5-3 with a 3.61 earned-run average.
""It's a move we really didn't want to make, but our 40 man (roster) is getting more talented these days and any time you add a new play to the roster it costs you a valuable contributor on the back end of your 40,"" Harris said. ""It's an unfortunate cost that comes with adding to our team."" jpparker@postmedia.com x.com/winstarparker","The Windsor Star; Windsor, Ont.","Windsor, Ont.","Parker, Jim",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 31, 2025",Free agency; Professional baseball,
Former deputy back to lead Greens with May:   Pedneault resigned six months ago for personal reasons,2025,"Six months ago, Jonathan Pedneault suddenly resigned as the federal Green Party's deputy leader. Just as abruptly, he's now revived his bid to co-lead the party.
At the time, Pedneault said his exit was due to personal reasons (and on Monday, he told a press conference in Ottawa it was a surprise health diagnosis). Privately, he had been frustrated with internal roadblocks that delayed his efforts to co-lead alongside party stalwart Elizabeth May.
On Monday, the Québécois activist, coming back from several months of human rights work on the front lines of global conflicts, declared he was back. He and May would be reviving their effort to become the party's first ever co-leaders, and they would complete the process by March, pending members' approval, in time for the next federal election.
Pedneault told reporters he had a ""reckoning"" in his months away from Canadian politics - driven by what he saw abroad, the election of Donald Trump, the rising fortunes of Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, and the lack of unifying alternative options for Canadians.
""As is evidenced by the people behind us, we are united and committed to delivering for Canadians at a time when there are no progressive alternatives out there,"" Pedneault said, flanked by May, Green MP Mike Morrice, and nearly a dozen members of the Green shadow cabinet. ""I think Canadians struggle so much right now in their daily lives ... when it comes to the climate emergency, our relationship with our neighbours to the south, the cost of living situation. Those are the things that we are focused on.""
Internal strife has rocked the Green Party as it attempted to revive itself in recent months.
Following Pedneault's exit last July, several members of the party's elected federal council and fund board resigned following inner conflicts, including party president Natalie Odd. Of those who resigned, some were among those who pushed back against Pedneault and May's efforts to implement co-leadership, arguing that overhauling the party's constitution to allow for two leaders should trigger another leadership race.
Miranda Woodland, who wrote a scathing letter when she resigned from the board overseeing party finances this summer, told the Star she believes the resignations ensure few senior party members will stand in the way of May and Pedneault's co-leadership agenda.
She described a vote on making Pedneault co-leader ""undemocratic,"" because there is no leadership contest, and said it is contrary to the party's commitment to being run by the grassroots.
Even though Pedneault and May were among several candidates to run on a co-leadership ticket in 2022, the party's constitution allows only one leader.
May emerged victorious in that race, while Pedneault finished a distant third. The pair then functioned as co-leaders while they attempted to formalize their proposed leadership structure, and pushed back against internal critics by arguing they had a mandate because their campaign platform was clear: A vote for one is a vote for the other.
On Monday, May and Pedneault downplayed that internal strife as part of the ""ups and downs"" faced by any political party, denied internal roadblocks caused Pedneault's exit, and attributed the lengthy process to implement co-leadership to the party's grassroots approach.
Members started to receive ballots that could change the constitution to allow co-leadership and name Pedneault co-leader in one vote Monday night, according to two internal party emails obtained by the Star. Results are expected by early March, May said.

"Urgent plea made as 2025 shapes up to be one of the hottest years yet; New Brunswick Green Party leader says Ottawa, province must pump substantial funds into trains, buses and other less polluting alternatives",2025,"With a new forecast from Environment Canada predicting 2025 will be one of the warmest years on record, New Brunswick's Green Party leader is renewing calls for stronger measures to reduce greenhouse gases that heat up the planet.
David Coon has been following the climate crisis for decades and wasn't surprised by the latest global mean temperature forecast, issued by federal research scientists last week.
They predict that 2025 will be among the top three hottest years in human history. Last year was already the hottest on record, more than 1.5 Celsius hotter than the pre-industrial average, crossing a dangerous threshold.
""It means we have to get our heads out of the sand and take urgent measures to get off fossil fuels,"" Coon said in an interview. ""If we keep on this path, many places in Canada will become inhospitable and in some places of the world, uninhabitable.""
World leaders have pledged to stop global warming, drawing a line at a global average temperature increase of 1.5 Celsius over pre-industrial levels.
While 1.5 C doesn't sound very hot, it's an average, with places like the Arctic heating up considerably more and spots like southwestern Canada warming considerably less. But the overall higher temperatures, experts warn, will lead to more wildfires, rapidly melting ice and increasingly powerful storms, posing a threat to life on the planet.
Bill Merryfield, a federal research scientist with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, told reporters at an online press conference Jan. 15 the forecast they'd worked on was more accurate than many other climate models, showing graphs displaying the accuracy of their work over the last two decades.
This year, the La Nina effect in east-central equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean will play a small role in cooling temperatures, but not enough to make a huge difference, he said.
Although the 1.5 C threshold was crossed last year, it does not mean that it's permanent. A 20-year average is needed for that dangerous marker to become official.
""But it does signal that the warming climate is approaching the threshold,"" Merryfield said. ""2025 will rival, but probably not exceed, the record warmth of 2024. But it almost certainly will become one of the warmest three years on record, along with 2024 and 2023, despite the absence of the warming influence of El Nino.""
El Nino, which is part of the natural cycle in the Pacific, generally boosts global temperatures.
Coon said given the alarming trend, the top priority should be cutting back on transportation emissions, which account for about one-fifth of greenhouse gases belching from Canada, one of the biggest pollution sources.
He argued that the federal carbon tax, in place for six years, has failed to curb emissions because many Canadians, and in particular New Brunswickers, don't have an alternative to driving.
The leader said to convince people to drive less, they need alternatives, such as mass transit and better inter-city bus and train routes that are both affordable and convenient.
He's proposing a sizeable investment by Ottawa and the province to get more trains, buses and streetcars running.
""With our car culture, the alternatives for getting around are piecemeal and poor,"" Coon said. ""The only way it would make a real difference is if there was an alternative available to you.""
Brunswick News asked for an interview with provincial Environment Minister Gilles LePage over several days but did not hear back from his spokeswoman.
In the Liberals 2024 election platform, they committed to increasing active transportation infrastructure, including walking and cycling trails.
They also said they'd boost support for home energy retrofits and the free heat pump program. As part of helping people save energy, they pledged to introduce a program for solar retrofits.
Lastly, the Liberals promised to ensure all government buildings were net zero and that the province's vehicle fleet, including school buses, were electrified by 2035.

Andrew Harris excited to start coaching career with Roughriders,2025,"Andrew Harris is gladly trading his football allegiance for a great opportunity.
Following a 14-year CFL career as a running back with the B.C. Lions (2010-15), Winnipeg Blue Bombers (2016-21) and Toronto Argonauts (2022-23), Harris, 37, was officially hired by the Saskatchewan Roughriders on Monday to serve as the team's new running backs coach
Now after years of being one of Saskatchewan's biggest rivals, Harris is looking forward to joining the team under head coach Corey Mace, who was the defensive coordinator in Toronto while Harris was playing with the Argos.
""I'm a rookie again now as a coach and you need guys that you can trust that will bring you along and will support you,"" said Harris, a Winnipeg native who retired after the 2023 season. ""I feel like this is a good situation for me, and you know, one that I would have never expected.
""But you know, at the end of the day, it's football. And I know football really well and I'm excited to help contribute to the success of the team this year.""
After his retirement from playing Harris, a four-time Grey Cup champion, got out of football and took a full-time sales job with a construction company.
""After I retired, I wanted to step away from the game a little bit and, you know, just re-evaluate what I wanted to do,"" said Harris, who worked part-time for the company while he was still playing. ""And honestly, I wasn't really missing football that much until the playoffs started last year.
""And that's when things really get geared up and I just know how that intensity kicks in and the attention to detail. That's when I first really started missing football, and was kind of thinking, maybe I want to get back into it.""
In fact, getting into coaching was something he had in mind while he was still playing. After signing with the Argonauts following five outstanding seasons in Winnipeg, Harris would occasionally put on the offensive headset during games that he wasn't playing in due to injury.
That experience, he believes, led him to this opportunity.
""The reason why I did that and took it upon myself is because I wanted to see if I would enjoy it,"" said Harris. ""So, I took the time while being hurt very opportunistically.
""I'm going to be rehabbing. I'm not going to be on the field. But what can I do to get myself in a situation to see what it's like to be a coach?
""After going through that process and seeing what it was, that's honestly what led to being here now.""
Harris, who said he spoke with others he knew who made the transition from playing to coaching, had conversations with a few teams from across the CFL about coaching jobs or front office opportunities.
But when he connected with Mace, something felt right despite the opportunity being with a team he went up against for so many years.
""The fan base is a great one,"" said Harris, who is replacing Anthony Vitale. ""It's always one of the toughest places to play, but always an exciting place to play. And I think there's a lot of energy and passion for the team, which is amazing.
""There's a bigger purpose there because you've got people that are expecting you to win and be great, and that pressure makes diamonds.
""It's just football, right?"" he added. ""The rivalries are amazing but as a coach, all you're expected to do is prepare your athletes to play the best they can and try to take the emotion out of it as much as possible.
""Being a Winnipegger, that's going to be hard to do, but at the end of the day, they're the other team that wanted to give me the opportunity to coach which I wanted to do.""
After ending his career as the top Canadian rusher in CFL history, Harris, who was named the league's top Canadian in 2017, believes he has a lot to offer in the coaching world.
""The one thing I know the most about is playing running back,"" said Harris, a five-time CFL all-star. ""I played 14 years and I've got a lot of knowledge to pass on. And I felt like if I would have waited any longer than maybe this opportunity would have went away.
""I was never the fastest, strongest, biggest, quickest dude. My edge was always my effort, and my edge was always the way I studied the game.
""Little intangibles that you can work on every day in practice and just finesse it over and over and over again, that's what I'm going to bring to the table for the Riders this year and a lot more.""
Harris, who is in the process of moving from London, Ont. back to Winnipeg, said he is also excited to work with Roughriders running back A.J. Ouellette, after the two were teammates with the Argonauts for two seasons.
""When I went to Toronto, I was really almost like a player-coach in a way,"" said Harris. ""My performance and dominance on the field that shifted. I wasn't the main guy anymore. And so, for me, passing nuggets and information and tips and little things down at A.J. and kind of being his ear on the sideline with the iPad; I was already kind of in that role.
""At the end of the day, though, playing with someone that respects you as an athlete (and) respects you as a player, it'll translate well to being respected as a coach.""
Harris also believes he can also help Ouellette put together a bounce back season in 2025 after the bruising back was limited to eight games last year after signing in Saskatchewan during free agency.
""The guy is obviously very physically gifted and works hard at being as strong as possible,"" said Harris. ""I'm challenging him now to kind of focus on being as dynamic and mobile as possible.
""I think that'll bode well for his longevity. It'll help him break more tackles because he'll be able to bounce off and have more balance.
""A.J. is a very, very smart player. He studies hard. He sees the holes well. He reads defences well.
""I think we're going to see some great things from A.J. and all the backs here.""

Roughriders hire Harris to serve as running backs coach; CFL,2025,"The Saskatchewan Roughriders have added a four-time Grey Cup champion to their coaching staff for the 2025 CFL season.
Andrew Harris, who won championships as a running back with the B.C. Lions, Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Toronto Argonauts, is joining Saskatchewan's staff as the running backs coach, replacing Anthony Vitale, who has stepped away due to personal reasons.
The 37-year-old Harris, a Winnipeg product, ended his career at the league's alltime Canadian rusher after retiring following the 2023 CFL season. Over 15 seasons with the B.C. Lions (2009-15), Blue Bombers (2016-21) and Argonauts (2022-23), Harris racked up 10,380 rushing yards and 51 touchdowns in his career. He also added 5,489 receiving yards and 32 touchdowns through the air.
Along with being a fourtime Grey Cup champion, Harris has received many personal accolades over his playing career, including being named the league's top Canadian in 2017. He was also named the Grey Cup's top Canadian in 2011 and again in 2019, where he also was named the game's MVP. Harris, who led the league in rushing four times, was named a CFL all-star five times and a West Division all-star six times.
While Harris developed a rivalry against Saskatchewan over his lengthy CFL career, he now joins the Green and White, where there are several familiar faces for him. A.J. Ouellette, Saskatchewan's top running back, played alongside Harris for two seasons in Toronto, where the two developed a close relationship.

Harris joins ex-Argos on Roughriders coaching staff,2025,"Andrew Harris is a rookie again. The Saskatchewan Roughriders hired the CFL record-holder for career rushing yards by a Canadian (10,380) as their running backs coach on Monday.
The 37-year-old joins a few familiar faces. Most notably, Riders head coach Corey Mace - then as defensive co-ordinator - and running back A.J. Ouellette were both with the Toronto Argonauts when Harris was there in 2022 and 2023. Harris also played five seasons with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.
""You need guys you can trust who will bring you along and support you,"" Harris told reporters. ""I feel this is a good situation for me, one I never would've expected being a Winnipeg guy ... but at the end of the day, it's football and I know football really well.""
Harris and Ouellette were close in Toronto, helping the franchise win the Grey Cup in their first year together. Harris said he was pretty much a player-coach already with the Argos and anticipates the transition will be seamless.
""I wasn't the main guy anymore (in the Argos running game), and so for me passing nuggets and information and tips and little things to A.J. ... I was already kind of in that role,"" Harris said. ""Now it's more official. The thing is that it's more personal for me, because I do care about (Ouellette) as a whole. I think as a coach you want to have that with all of your players, but it's a good start to have that relationship kicked off.""","Toronto Star; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.",,"Torstar Syndication Services, a Division of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited","Jan 21, 2025",,
Harris goes green:   Former Bomber joins Roughriders coaching staff,2025,"The magnitude of the move is not lost on Andrew Harris, nor is the fact that many who share his hometown won’t be all that pleased with his new football home.
Harris might not have started his CFL career in Winnipeg, joining the B.C. Lions as a fresh-faced running back in his early 20s, but it is where he grew up and where he cemented himself as one of the greatest running backs ever to play the three-down game.
It’s also where Harris first harboured a healthy hatred for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. That disdain for all things green would take on a whole new meaning after Harris signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2016, returning home to lead the Blue and Gold to a pair of Grey Cup championships and plenty of victories against the Riders — the Bombers’ most-hated rival — before joining the Toronto Argonauts in 2022.
It should come as no surprise Harris’s decision to join the Roughriders coaching staff, announced Monday as the club’s new running backs coach, was met with mixed reviews from both sides.
Love it or hate it, Harris said he’s simply focused on the new opportunity ahead of him and none of that stuff from the past. Make no mistake, his allegiance is now with Riderville.
“The fan base is a great one. It’s always been one of the toughest places to play, but always an exciting place to play, and I think there’s a lot of energy and passion for the team, which is amazing,” Harris said. “When you have 30,000 on your side, and then a whole province behind you that really cares about the team… there’s a bigger purpose there, because you’ve got people there who are expecting you to win and be great, and that pressure makes diamonds. I’m looking forward just getting into the group.”
Harris noted a few times during his media conference the Riders were the ones to offer him a job, adding he had spoken to a few teams in the process. What he didn’t say was he attempted to contact the Bombers but his calls were not returned.
It’s unclear why the Bombers were seemingly uninterested in adding to their coaching staff someone as decorated as Harris, who is the league’s all-time leader in rushing yards by a Canadian. He’s also a four-time Grey Cup champion and a five-time CFL all-star who is well respected across the league, particularly in Winnipeg.
Part of it would certainly be that the Bombers already have a quality running backs coach in Jason Hogan, who has done an admirable job with Harris’s replacement, Brady Oliveira. Oliveira, who has talked glowingly about his relationship with Hogan, has led the league in rushing the last two years and was named the CFL’s Most Outstanding Player in November.
Part of it could be a lack of trust between Harris and Bombers head coach Mike O’Shea that first arose when Harris showed up to training camp out of shape ahead of the 2021 season. With Oliveira ready to take on a bigger role the following year, the transition from one Winnipeg-born tailback to another led to a messy breakup between the Bombers and Harris, who was given a low-ball offer at the 11th hour before eventually signing with the Argos.
“It’s just football. The rivalries are amazing, but as a coach, all you’re expected to do is prepare your athletes to play the best they can and try to take the emotion out of it as much as possible,” Harris said. “Being a Winnipegger, that’s going to be hard to do, but at the end of the day, they’re the team that wanted to give me the opportunity to coach, which I wanted to do. Ability is nothing without opportunity, and they’re the ones giving me the opportunity, so I’m going to do whatever I can to make sure that I’m giving the backs, the offence, the run game — the whole team — the best I can.”
While Harris might be in enemy territory, there are a few friendly faces in Regina who should provide a soft landing.
Riders head coach Corey Mace was the Argos’ defensive co-ordinator when Harris was there for two years. It’s the same with Edwin Harrison, who is now running the offensive line in Saskatchewan after two years as the running backs coach in Toronto.
“When I was speaking with Mace… it’s about finding the opportunity with the right group of guys that I could gel with. I’m a rookie again now, as a coach, and you need guys that you can trust, that will bring you along and will support you,” Harris said. “I feel like this is a good situation for me, and one I never would have expected. But at the end of the day, it’s football, and I know football really well and I’m excited to contribute to the success of the team this year.”
Harris will also be working closely with No. 1 running back A.J. Ouellette, Saskatchewan’s prized free-agent signing last winter. Harris and Ouellette began as teammates in Toronto, but have since grown into close friends, with Harris sporting a Riders Ouellette jersey while attending a game in Hamilton last year.
It was nearby, in London, Ont., where Harris had been working a sales job as he prepared for life after football. But once the summer ended and fall arrived, with the leaves changing colour and the weather dipping, Harris knew he wasn’t ready to leave the game just yet.
“After I retired, I wanted to step away from the game a little bit and just re-evaluate what I wanted to do,” he said. “I wasn’t really missing football all that much until the playoffs started last year. That’s when things really gear up and I just know how that intensity kicks in and the attention to detail, and that’s when I first really started missing football and was kind of thinking maybe I wanted to get back into it.”
Another exciting development for Harris is that he’s moved his young family, including his partner Danica and their two sons, Axton and Eastyn, back to Winnipeg to be around a bigger support group. Harris also looks forward to seeing more of his teenage daughter, Hazel, who lives in Winnipeg.
“I’m excited just to be back home. Having two young boys and no family or support… it’s tough not having that, so really looking forward to having the family back with grandparents and my daughter and aunties and uncles and everyone around,” Harris said. “Family will stay there, and I’ll go back and forth for the first bit and then we’ll see how this year plays out.”

Saskatchewan Roughriders unveil 2025 CFL schedule
Roughriders' GM Jeremy O'Day updates QB situation and more",The Leader Post (Online); Regina,Regina,Taylor Shire,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 20, 2025",Football,Nom: Saskatchewan Roughriders; NAICS: 711211
"To hell and back:   Harris relieved doping ordeal is over, but disappointed in the process and lack of support from Curling Canada",2025,"Briane Harris called the last 11 months a living hell.
The succinct answer was the only way the Winnipeg-born curler could aptly describe what her ban from competitive curling had been like, as she was strung along by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and saw little to no support from Curling Canada while she was prohibited from competing, training or communicating with her coaches and teammates.
“I was told right from the beginning that I was on my own,” Harris told the Free Press in an emotional 22-minute phone interview on Wednesday.
Harris, a four-time national champion lead with Kerri Einarson’s Gimli-based team, tested positive for trace amounts of Ligandrol, an illegal substance, on the eve of the Scotties Tournament of Hearts last February in Calgary.
On Tuesday, nearly a year after she was provisionally banned and five months after she appealed her suspension — claiming that she had unknowingly been exposed to the drug through bodily contact — the court ruled she bears no fault or negligence for having the performance enhancer in her system.
The ruling revealed that she was exposed to the substance through intimate contact and the exchange of bodily fluids with her husband (Harris said it was from kissing), who was consuming the ‘Crossfit Stack,’ which contains Ligandrol.
Harris said she was relieved to finally hear the verdict, but exhausted by a process that took far longer than anyone had imagined it would. Her lawyers guessed, based on experience, that it would take from two to four weeks for the court to make a ruling. As each month passed, they were just as confused as to why it was taking so long.
“It was really hard at the beginning, obviously, but then I found it became harder as I had to wait,” she said.
“I even said to my family, it probably would’ve been easier to hear that I had a suspension but just hear right away, rather than be on pins and needles for however many months it was since August. That was probably the hardest part of it all.”
Harris estimated her lawyers sent seven letters to the court since August in search of a verdict. Each attempt was stonewalled, but the court’s hot and cold responses gave the curler hope that a decision was near.
In October, it said a reasoned response (a verdict with an explanation) was being finalized and that a ruling would be issued shortly.
A month later, another letter was answered, this time saying the defendant would “find out in due course.” The next several attempts were met with the same response.
“It was a little bit of both, kind of leaving me in the dark but then also stringing me along a little bit,” Harris said. “I wish they never used that word, ‘shortly,’ because it obviously got my hopes up at that time and then to not hear until January… is pretty brutal.”
Harris and her lawyers never asked why the ruling was delayed, nor did the Court of Arbitration for Sport provide an explanation.
In many ways, that didn’t matter anymore. What did matter was she could play the sport she loves again.
“I was just overwhelmed, and I couldn’t believe it. I mean, I’m getting emotional talking about it now. I didn’t cry right away when I saw it, I was just so happy and I was like wow, this is amazing. But when I called my husband and my parents, that’s when I started breaking down. Just so happy. Happy tears,” she said.
Not all has been swept under the rug, though.
Harris said the last year of proceedings has left her with a sour taste toward Curling Canada for not supporting one of its athletes during the darkest stretch of her career.
“When you’ve given so much to a game and an organization like Curling Canada, being on Team Canada for four years and representing Canada at the worlds … it’s difficult when you feel like all that doesn’t matter in that moment, even though I told Curling Canada that I was innocent, and I was still kind of left isolated,” she said, brought to tears again.
Curling Canada’s high performance director, David Murdoch, said the national organization was following rules that prohibit it from engaging with an athlete who is serving a ban, set in place by the World Anti-Doping Agency. It’s a rule all national sport organizations must follow with banned athletes.
“It’s pretty clear with WADA and the rules around engagement and everything that we were informed about due process was that contact with Briane was to be extremely minimal as part of the sanctions that were a part of the process,” Murdoch said Wednesday evening.
“I will say challenging because as a national team program athlete, you want to look after your athletes from a wellness perspective. We did speak and explained to her that this is what the situation is, and as much as we want to be in contact as often as possible, that’s normally the due process that we had to go through.”
Murdoch explained it would also be a tall task to get the rule changed. There’s no guarantee that Harris’ experience wouldn’t happen again to another athlete.
“It’s definitely not for an NSO to change those rules. Those are rules that are put in place by WADA, so I think it would be something we could feedback for sure. Something we’d like to change? Absolutely,” Murdoch said.
The last year has been equally burdensome for Harris’ husband Tory, who was unaware the substance he was taking was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and didn’t know he could pass it to his wife.
Briane Harris blamed Curling Canada and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES), which handle athletes’ education on banned substances.
“If they knew this could happen, then how do they expect a non-athlete partner to know the rules and what’s allowed and what’s not?” she said.
Kevin Bean, the executive director of sport integrity for the CCES, said all national and international athletes are required to take a Canadian Anti-Doping Program course that explains how the rules apply to them. International athletes who curl must also enroll in an education program provided by the World Curling Federation.
The initial course with the CCES, which Bean said is reviewed annually and whenever there is a violation, is an hour. Athletes are asked to do a 30-minute refresher course in subsequent years. Spouses and partners do not take the programs.
“I think it’s something that we would consider,” Bean said of whether Harris’ case would evoke some sort of change. “There’s been other cases in the past … where we have to consider whether or not the messaging alerts people or … what they have access to now should give them enough knowledge to know that in addition to checking their own medications, as part of the rules, an athlete is responsible not only for themselves but their entourage.”
Harris said she threw stones on the ice for the first time again Tuesday. She also spoke with Einarson, who is with the rest of the team in Guelph, Ont., this week for the Grand Slam of Curling’s WFG Masters event. Team alternate Krysten Karwacki has filled in as lead in Harris’ absence.
When they return from the event, the team will meet to discuss its lineup plans, with the Scotties just weeks away. Harris, who is six months pregnant with her second child, has stayed in shape throughout her pregnancy and said she is ready to make her comeback.
“It was really good to get out there and feel good and prove to myself even that I can still do it, and I still can do it pregnant, and I can do it even though I haven’t been on the ice in the year,” she said.
“It was just really a good feeling to get back on the ice and feel natural, and not be as rusty as I was expecting.”

Harris has doping suspension lifted; Lead for four-time Canadian champion Einarson hasn't played since 2024 Scotties,2025,"The decisions keep on coming for Kerri Einarson and her Manitoba team.
On Tuesday, they learned longtime lead Briane Harris had her provisional suspension for an anti-doping rule violation lifted ""with immediate effect"" by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The court found she bears ""no fault or negligence"" in the matter that has cost the curler 10-plus months of participation with the world class team.
""After what had to have unimaginable stress on Briane and her family, we're so happy and relieved to see Briane's case resolved today,"" said Team Einarson in a statement Tuesday. ""It has been a difficult 11 months for all of us not knowing what was going to happen, so we're thankful that we can all move forward with some clarity.""
The Winnipeg athlete tested positive for trace amounts of the prohibited substance Ligandrol on Feb. 15, 2024 - hours before the Scotties Tournament of Hearts were set to open in Calgary. The results came after she was subject to an out-of-competition doping control test.
Harris hasn't curled since, with the provisional ban keeping her from competing, training and even interacting with her rinkmates and coach Reid Carruthers.
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR TEAM EINARSON
Krysten Karwacki, a longtime alternate for Team Einarson, stepped in immediately for Harris at lead for last year's Scotties and has since pulled her weight, earning a firstteam all-star nod at the national championship.
But with Harris likely returning to the team in the near future, decisions need to be made by the decorated team.
The lift of the suspension comes amid Team Einarson's participation in the Grand Slam of Curling's World Financial Group Masters, which began Tuesday morning and was deemed as a trial run for the team with new second Karlee Burgess in place.
Burgess, 26, is in for Einarson's injured all-star second, Shannon Birchard.
""This week, we are treating the WFG Masters Grand Slam event in Guelph as a team dress rehearsal for the Scotties Tournament of Hearts with the lineup we announced earlier this month,"" said the Team Einarson statement.
""Once this event is done, and after we assess where we're at, we will sit down as a team for further discussions.
""We will have no further comment on today's announcement until then.""
Karwacki could be asked to step back into an alternate's role.
After all, the lineup of Einarson, third Val Sweeting, Birchard and Harris won four straight Canadian titles, so their success together is as unmatched as it gets on the national curling landscape.
But that depends on whether Harris and her team feels she is ready to return to full-time lead duties and if the team wants to again reshuffle its lineup after adding Burgess earlier this month.
The Scotties are, after all, only four weeks away.
Harris could also slot in as the alternate for the team at the national championship, so she can ease her way back into competitive curling mode.
HOW'S IT BEEN FOR EINARSON AND SWEETING?
The curveballs just keep coming at Einarson and company.
""Yeah, it definitely seems that way,"" said the decorated skip.
""We're currently curling with 50 per cent of our curling team that we've had together for the last seven years. So it's, for sure, been difficult to lose both of our front-end players.""
Indeed, Birchard has been sidelined with an undiagnosed knee injury for most of this curling campaign, so the team turned to Burgess - inviting the Team Chelsea Carey third to join them - to replace Birchard.
Burgess accepted, giving them a full squad heading into the stretch drive for the Scotties from Feb. 14-23 in Thunder Bay, Ont.
""We've had everything thrown at us and can't seem to to catch a break,"" said Einarson. ""But I think we finally maybe caught one getting Karlee. So we're really excited about that.""
Getting Harris back can be considered another break for the squad.
Along the way, Einarson and Sweeting have managed to limit the damage with talent filling in for Harris and Birchard out of commission.
""It just shows our resilience and how determined we are to have success, even though we only have our original two players,"" added Einarson. ""We're just going with the flow. And we're just trying to keep it light out there and not put so much pressure on ourselves. And I think that's what's been huge, too."" tsaelhof@postmedia.com x.com/ToddSaelhofPM","The Province; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Saelhof, Todd",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 15, 2025",Tournaments & championships; Curling,
Harris has doping Suspension lifted; Lead for four-time Canadian champion Einarson hasn't played since 2024 Scotties,2025,"The decisions keep on coming for Kerri Einarson and her Manitoba team.
On Tuesday, they learned longtime lead Briane Harris had her provisional suspension for an anti-doping rule violation lifted ""with immediate effect"" by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The court found she bears ""no fault or negligence"" in the matter that has cost the curler 10-plus months of participation with the world class team.
""After what had to have unimaginable stress on Briane and her family, we're so happy and relieved to see Briane's case resolved today,"" said Team Einarson in a statement Tuesday. ""It has been a difficult 11 months for all of us not knowing what was going to happen, so we're thankful that we can all move forward with some clarity.""
The Winnipeg athlete tested positive for trace amounts of the prohibited substance Ligandrol on Feb. 15, 2024 - hours before the Scotties Tournament of Hearts were set to open in Calgary. The results came after she was subject to an out-of-competition doping control test.
Harris hasn't curled since, with the provisional ban keeping her from competing, training and even interacting with her rinkmates and coach Reid Carruthers.
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR TEAM EINARSON
Krysten Karwacki, a longtime alternate for Team Einarson, stepped in immediately for Harris at lead for last year's Scotties and has since pulled her weight, earning a first-team all-star nod at the national championship.
But with Harris likely returning to the team in the near future, decisions need to be made by the decorated team.
The lift of the suspension comes amid Team Einarson's participation in the Grand Slam of Curling's World Financial Group Masters, which began Tuesday morning and was deemed as a trial run for the team with new second Karlee Burgess in place.
Burgess, 26, is in for Einarson's injured all-star second, Shannon Birchard.

"Riders GM achieving off-season objectives; With Harris extended as starting pivot, newcomer Maier could be future option",2025,"The Saskatchewan Roughriders are making good progress on their off-season to-do list.
This winter, the CFL club has extended starting quarterback Trevor Harris, acquired a backup QB in Jake Maier and recently resigned middle linebacker Jameer Thurman to a two-year contract extension.
While general manager Jeremy O'Day continues to negotiate with his team's pending free agents ahead of Feb. 11, he's also attending the CFL's winter meetings this week in Charlotte, N.C.
And on Tuesday, he met with the media to discuss several topics regarding his team:
QUARTERBACK UPDATE
Along with extending Harris, one of the biggest moves O'Day has made this off-season was the trade for and subsequent signing of Maier from the Calgary Stampeders, which gives the Roughriders the veteran backup quarterback they were seeking.
""After we identified what we wanted to do at quarterback, it's one of those situations where do you wait until free agency to talk to somebody or is there a possibility for you to make a trade with the team that you know probably isn't bringing them back,"" said O'Day, who flipped an eighth-round pick to Calgary for Maier. ""Once we agreed to (trade) the draft pick, it's kind of just a no-brainer for us to get a chance to talk to him.
""Still some risk there, being able to get them signed before free agency, but we felt the reward was worth the risk.""
While Maier, 27, is in line to back up the 38-year-old Harris for the 2025 season, many are wondering if Maier could eventually take over as the starter the following season and beyond.
""It's a fresh start for him; new team, new organization,"" O'Day said of Maier, who has 45 career CFL starts. ""So, we'll see where it goes.
""We haven't had any of those discussions about past this year, to be honest with Jake or Trevor, but they both know the situation that we're in.
""Hopefully we have a lot of success with the guys that we have and we can keep it rolling with the guys we have. But you know, that's kind of yet to be determined what 2026 looks like.""
SHORT YARDAGE QB
With Shea Patterson on an expiring deal, the Roughriders don't have a quarterback under contract next season with much short-yardage experience.
And who the team will deploy to handle short-yardage scenarios is still to be determined, according to O'Day.
""It's going to depend on what it looks like in free agency and then who we have,"" he said. ""We're going to have a quarterback that's going to run the short yardage; it's just more dependent on who we think will be successful for it.
""We do have a plan in place for both situations, whether we have someone that I guess the public would say is a true short-yardage quarterback, or whether we don't have someone that we feel (is a) short-yardage quarterback.
""Do you want to just have a quarterback that's just your short yardage guy, or do you want a number three that you feel like is going to develop into a starter someday? Those are questions that we'll have to answer and will be answered through free agency.""
EXTENDING THURMAN
Another big move O'Day has made this off-season was the re-signing of middle linebacker Jameer Thurman to a two-year extension on Monday.
Last season, after signing with the Riders in free agency, the 29-year-old was named a West Division all-star while being a leader of the team on and off the field.
""What he brings to the locker room is invaluable,"" said O'Day. ""Coming to a new team and trying to get used to the players in the locker room and the coaching staff and also trying to develop yourself into a leader of a new team is often challenging, but he did a nice job of that.
""He's just a natural leader; great work ethic, and someone you definitely want to build your defence around. It was nice to sign the twoyear deal."" tshire@postmedia.com","Star - Phoenix; Saskatoon, Sask.","Saskatoon, Sask.",Taylor Shire,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 15, 2025",Free agency,
Court of Arbitration for Sport clears Harris for return to Team Einarson,2025,"Briane Harris can curl again.
On Tuesday, nearly a year after being banned from competing, training or communicating with her coaches and teammates, the Manitoba curler was cleared to return to the pebbled ice after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that she bears no fault or negligence for being exposed to a banned substance.
“We can confirm that Briane Harris is immediately eligible to participate in all Curling Canada events,” Curling Canada wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “We are pleased to welcome her back to competition and wish her the best in her future curling endeavours.”
Harris, who throws lead for Kerri Einarson’s Gimli-based team, tested positive for trace amounts of Ligandrol on the eve of the 2024 Scotties Tournament of Hearts last February. At the time, she said that she had unknowingly been exposed to the substance through bodily contact.
The court’s ruling revealed she was exposed to the drug through intimate contact and the exchange of bodily fluids with her husband, who was consuming the ‘Crossfit Stack,’ which contains Ligandrol.
Ligandrol, also called LGD-4033 or Anabolicum, has been shown to increase overall strength and lean body mass while decreasing body fat. It is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Harris claimed she was unaware her husband was taking the substance.
In the end, Harris, who was facing a suspension of up to four years, won her appeal.
“I cannot put into words how happy and relieved I am feeling right now,” Harris said in an interview with CBC Sports. “I have been shaking all morning since receiving the news that I thought would never come. I am exonerated and it feels so incredibly amazing.
“I am so excited to play the sport I love again, and I can’t wait to do so.”
Harris is expected to rejoin Team Einarson once it returns from the Grand Slam of Curling’s WFG Masters event in Guelph, Ont., this week. Alternate Krysten Karwacki has played lead in her absence.
Einarson, who rolled to a 10-1 win over Team Kayla Skrlik Tuesday afternoon at the WFG Masters, said the news was a relief.
“It’s such great news for Briane, I’m going to get emotional,” Einarson said, fighting back tears. “But we’re super happy for her. I know this has been challenging for her.”
The team expressed its relief that Harris’s ordeal has ended with a news release.
“After what had to have been unimaginable stress on Briane and her family we’re so happy and relieved to see Briane’s case resolved today. It has been a difficult 11 months for all of us not knowing what was going to happen so we’re thankful that we can all move forward with some clarity,” Team Einarson said.
“This week, we are treating the WFG Masters Grand Slam event in Guelph as a team dress rehearsal for the Scotties Tournament of Hearts with the lineup we announced earlier this month. Once this event is done and after we assess where we’re at, we will sit down as a team for further discussions.”
Harris’s long-awaited ruling certainly provided a sigh of relief for Einarson, who has struggled to ice a consistent lineup all season.
While Harris served a ban, second Shannon Birchard dealt with a knee injury that popped up during a training event in mid-August. The ailment kept Birchard on the shelf for the first half of the season and has now ended her campaign after she aggravated it during her season debut at a tour event in Swift Current, Sask., last month.
With Birchard out, the team flipped through four different replacement players — Laura Walker, Dawn McEwen, Joanne Courtney and Brittany Tran — before reaching out to fellow Manitoban Karlee Burgess, who agreed to join Einarson, third Val Sweeting and Karwacki for the remainder of the season.
Burgess, who was the third for Chelsea Carey’s squad, left a struggling team that lost its pre-qualified berths at the women’s national championship and Canadian Curling Trials as a result of her move.
Now the 26-year-old Winnipegger is a part of a rink that is seeking a fifth Scotties title in six years.
Despite the constantly juggled lineup, Einarson has managed a respectable season to this point, with two event victories and a 24-14 record. Hers is one of three squads that has pre-qualified for the Scotties Tournament of Hearts, which goes in Thunder Bay, Ont., from Feb. 14-23.
Winnipeg’s Team Kaitlyn Lawes and Team Rachel Homan of Ontario, which will represent Team Canada, are the others.

The Scotties are, after all, only four weeks away.
Harris could also slot in as the alternate for the team at the national championship, so that she can ease her way back into competitive curling mode.
Stay tuned on all that.
The Harris situation?
Ligandrol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances because of its performance-enhancing properties.
The 32-year-old Harris claimed she was unwittingly exposed to the drug via bodily contact.
Then her B-sample returned positive in March and a hearing with the Switzerland-based CAS was held Aug. 23.
An appeal from Harris and her counsel, sports lawyers Amanda Fowler and Emir Crowne, then followed, with the curler arguing she did not know or suspect her husband had been ingesting Ligandrol or that any intimate contact would cause her to be exposed to the drug.
""The testimonies provided by the athlete and her husband were credible and demonstrated that the athlete was unaware of her husband's use of Ligandrol and her exposure to the substance,"" the document said.
It took many months, but Harris' counsel received the CAS statement overturning the ban Tuesday morning.
""We are very pleased with the outcome of Briane's case,"" said Fowler in an email to Postmedia. ""More importantly, we are thrilled that Briane is now able to move forward and re-join her team in competition.""

Clean water hopes on brink of collapse for First Nations; Green party leader urges MPs to put differences aside and pass key legislation,2025,"A pivotal bill that would have ensured First Nations had clean water and wastewater services that are on par with Canadian cities could die with the collapse of the Liberal government.
Bill C-61, the First Nations Clean Water Act, is one of several bills that could be doomed, after Justin Trudeau's resignation on Monday prompted a Liberal leadership race and prorogation of Parliament.
Under a prorogation, all bills that did not reach royal assent are wiped off the board and must be reintroduced once Parliament returns to sit. Parliament will be prorogued until March 24 and it's unclear if the First Nations Clean Water Act will be brought back onto the legislative table before an election is triggered.
Opposition parties like the NDP, Bloc and Conservatives have clarified that they will vote non-confidence to topple the government as soon as possible, sparking a spring election.
John P. Brown, the executive director of the First Nations advisory committee on safe Drinking water, calls the bill ""imperfect"" but essential. It would have legislated ""for the very first time that Canada had the duty and obligation to provide adequate access to clean water to First Nations across the country,"" he said.
The bill would have also ensured Ottawa's legal obligation to fund the development and maintenance of water infrastructure and provided minimum quality standards.
It's why the bill represented ""fundamental human rights that, up until now, have not been protected for Indigenous peoples,"" Brown added.
Brown has worked for years toward major reforms of First Nation water policy and played a role in launching an $8-billion class action lawsuit that saw 259 First Nations demand the right to clean water. The federal government settled, and agreed to modernize First Nations drinking water legislation. The settlement led to the repeal of a Harper-era water act and the development of Bill C-61.
Now, after years of work by several Indigenous organizations and individuals to get the bill close to the finish line, Brown calls the bill's uncertain future a ""tragedy of immense measure.""
Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) national chief, calls the failure to pass Bill C-61 ""a failure to uphold commitments to First Nations and their right to safe drinking water.""
Woodhouse understands that political parties want ""to do their politics"" ahead of an election, but she believes clean drinking water for First Nations peoples should be a priority for Ottawa.
""All parliamentarians must protect children in this country, including First Nations children,"" Woodhouse told Canada's National Observer.
On Wednesday, Green party Leader Elizabeth May wrote to all federal party leaders, urging them to work together to pass key legislation, including the First Nations Clean Water Act.
Mike Morrice, Green MP representing Kitchener Centre, understands the bill's importance. He worked closely with the neighbouring chief of Six Nations located near Kitchener to put forward amendments to the bill.
Morrice calls the bill imperfect, but says it would have made a difference for Six Nations, where 70 per cent of those living on reserve don't have access to clean drinking water.
""It's a big part of why Elizabeth wrote the letter - to see if there's any openness to try to ensure that we could get support for the items we agree on before an election,"" he said.
Partisan politics has pre-empted cross-party collaboration ahead of an election. It remains unclear if the opposition parties will agree to pass key non-partisan legislative items before an election.
If legislation isn't passed, voters will have a say in what kind of government they want at the helm to reintroduce the bill. National Chief Woodhouse says the AFN will continue to lobby for the legislation, whether when Parliament returns in March or after an election.
In a statement, Minister of Indigenous Services Canada Patty Hajdu said that members of Parliament had a critical opportunity ""to right historic wrongs"" by passing the legislation but failed to do so, pointing to opposition parties.
""During a critical moment to do what was right, the NDP and Conservatives unfortunately blocked the bill from moving forward,"" she said.
""While the future of the bill is unknown, what remains certain is our work with First Nations partners to ensure clean drinking water for generations to come,"" the statement added.
In another statement, NDP Indigenous Services critic Lori Idlout criticized the Liberals and Conservatives.
Liberals had a decade to end boil water advisories and ongoing human rights violations against Indigenous peoples, but failed to act until the last minute, Idlout said, pointing out that the last Conservative federal government, under Stephen Harper, didn't do any better. That government weakened water protections, which sparked major Indigenous resistance with Idle No More in 2013.
""An NDP government will uphold its obligations and ensure every First Nation has the clean drinking water that meets minimum human rights standards as contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,"" the statement continued.

Making waves:   Waheeda Harris highlights the three trends to watch for in the cruise industry this year,2025,"It’s expected that 37.1 million cruise passengers will set sail in 2025, according to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the world’s largest cruise trade group. Cruise operators are tweaking their offerings to meet growing demand and fit an evolving traveller.
Solo travel, wellness offerings and improvements in sustainability lead cruise trends this year. And expedition cruises are expected to continue attracting people, having already seen an increase of 71 per cent in passengers from 2019 to 2023.
Here’s a quick look at what’s ahead.
SOLO TRAVEL
More women are boarding cruise ships on their own, making up two-thirds of solo cruise travellers, a steadily rising cohort, according to Samuel Spencer, owner and general manager of Calgary-based Ocean & River Cruises Travel. “Small groups foster a more inclusive environment for solo travellers, and women are gravitating toward expedition cruises or river cruises,” he says.
HX Expeditions, based in Oslo, Norway, sails through Greenland, the Northwest Passage/Canadian Arctic, Patagonia and Alaska, among other destinations. Between 2022 and 2023, HX Expeditions reported a 53 per cent growth in solo cruisers, who represent one in four of its passengers.
To attract solo tourists, its expedition ships offer some itineraries without single supplements – a premium fee for individuals using a cabin designated for two – along with discounts or credits for solo passengers. In 2024, 50 per cent of solo travellers sailed HX Expeditions without paying a single supplement; the other 50 per cent received discounts.
To meet the demand, Celebrity Cruises’ most recent ships, Celebrity Beyond (2022) and Celebrity Ascent (2023) have more solo staterooms than other cruise lines. Both ships offer 32 ocean-view staterooms with an “infinite veranda,” a floorto-ceiling window that opens with the press of a button. Some ships only offer solo travellers interior cabins, with oceanview rooms available with a single supplement fee.
River cruise companies Avalon and Tauck have also embraced solo cruisers, offering cabins without single supplement fees on every journey. Riviera River Cruises also has a lengthy list of solo traveller cruises without fees for singles on many of the most popular European routes such as the Rhone through Burgundy, France, or the Duoro River through Portugal’s Douro Valley.
SUSTAINABILITY Most cruise companies are adopting energy-efficiency measures, recycling, reducing water waste and eliminating singleuse plastics. There are even ships able to produce fresh water on board, according to CLIA.
The association has ambitious plans for all its ocean cruise members to reduce carbon emissions globally by 40 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero carbon by 2050.
But the No. 1 environmental issue for the cruise industry is reducing dependence on fossil fuels. According to CLIA’s 2023 sustainability report, there are 32 pilot programs testing sustainable fuels, with 24 focused on biofuels produced from waste oil and fats.
Even the world’s largest cruise ship – Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas – is trying to do its part. The 7,600-passenger ship is powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which produces 30 per cent fewer carbon emissions compared with oil. Sixty per cent of new ships from now until 2028 will be powered by LNG, CLIA says.
As of 2026, ships sailing Norway’s fjords that are below 10,000 gross tonnes can only use alternative fuels; this ruling extends to larger ships by January, 2032. Norway’s Hurtigruten Group has been an early adopter of sustainable practices, working closely with the communities it visits.
“Sustainability has been our top priority for the past 15 years, during which we have launched multiple industry-leading firsts,” stated Carly Biggart, vice-president of the Americas for Hurtigruten. The cruise line was the first to ban the use of heavy oil in 2009 and single-use plastics in 2018. It has three battery-hybrid powered ships after introducing the first one in 2019. Last year, it had one of the lowest food-waste-per-guest ratios in the industry. Plus, Hurtigruten Group is developing what it hopes will be the world’s first zero emission ship, scheduled to launch in 2030.
But do travellers care about how ecofriendly a cruise ship is? “When we’re talking about thoughtful travel, like to the Arctic, Antarctica or Galapagos, travellers expect the operators to be doing their due diligence,” Spencer, of Ocean & River Cruises Travel, says, “but the majority aren’t asking about sustainability.”
Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental groups, is paying attention, however, and isn’t impressed by the industry’s status. The organization’s 2024 cruise ship report card paints a bleak picture when it comes to sewage treatment, air pollution and waste-water quality. But there are 10 companies who were given an A grade for transparency of their sustainability status: Disney, Regent, Hurtigruten, HX, Viking, P&O Australia, Virgin, Oceania, MSC and Norwegian.
WELLNESS Rest and relaxation is not just about laying back in a deck chair. It’s getting easier to focus on wellness while at sea.
For many, that might mean travelling without children. And Virgin Voyages’ adults-only ships offer an irreverent interpretation of traditional ocean cruising that embraces wellness trends.
“The traditional kid areas have been reimagined into outdoor gyms, yoga areas and hammock lounges on our ships,” said CEO Nirmal Saverimuttu. “We are proudly a kid-free market.”
January is “well-being season” on Virgin Voyages, with all sailings this month featuring additional wellness options such as acupuncture and personal training. But every ship offers spas with a hydrotherapy circuit, mocktails and healthy dining options with gluten-free and vegan items.
River cruising is upping its wellness game, too. In spring 2023, AmaWaterways built a full-sized pickleball court on the sundeck of AmaMagna, which will sail Europe’s Danube in 2025. This river cruise line was one of the first to introduce bicycles for passengers to use in port and in 2019 began hiring “wellness hosts” – certified sports medicine specialists and personal trainers – to lead workout classes, guide bike tours and design active excursions at destinations.
On board Cunard’s Queen Anne, which launched in spring 2024, a much-improved spa experience includes more saunas, pools, foot baths and workout spaces, plus a three-day wellness-at-sea program where passengers can choose to relax, energize or detox. Plus, the ship’s Pavilion Wellness Café offers healthy cuisine options.
Wellness-focused passengers also look to Oceania Cruises for its spa experience on board. The Aquamar Spa + Vitality Center programs offer travellers thalassotherapy pools, spa treatments, fitness and foods curated for individual wellness plans. In port, passengers taking part in the program can sign up for wellness shore excursions such as the Hell’s Gate Mud Bath Retreat in Rotorua, New Zealand, or meditating with a monk in Bangkok, Thailand.
Cyclists who like to sail can also join the combined offering from Canadian luxury tour operator Butterfield & Robinson and L.A.-based Uniworld River Cruises. An eight-day Rhine River cruise from Basel to Amsterdam, with two departure options in May and in September, blends B&R’s cycling route cultural immersion expertise with the unpack-once delights of cruising.
Runners should look at the Run for Fun Cruise Tours, which partners with AmaWaterways and Norwegian Cruise Lines to set up 5K races in several ports. In February, 2025, the Caribbean itinerary begins in New Orleans and heads south to Belize, Honduras and Mexico, then in September, starting from Honolulu, Hawaii, runners can take part in 5K races on the islands of Kaui, Hawaii Island and Maui.","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Harris, Waheeda",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 11, 2025",Ships; Trends; Celebrities; Carbon; Cruise lines; Sustainability; Resorts & spas; Travel; Expeditions; Fees & charges; Bicycling,Nom: Virgin Voyages; NAICS: 483112
"Elizabeth May proposes California, Oregon, Washington join Canada after Trump's 51st state threat",2025,"Amid repeated pledges by U.S. president-elect Donald Trump to annex Canada, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May has jokingly resurrected a decades-old proposal for British Columbia to form Cascadia, an independent nation with the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington.
She first suggested California join Canada, before mentioning Cascadia.
""You think we want to be the 51st state? Nah. Maybe California would like to be the 11th province. How about it? California, Oregon, Washington,"" she said.
""Have we got a deal for you; free health care. Universal free health care. No more one-year-olds who suddenly fall off the Medicaid list and their parents are in the news because they're trying to do a GoFundMe to get their daughter to a doctor,"" May told a Parliament Hill press availability last week.
She also pledged ""safer streets,"" ""strict gun laws"" and free abortions, and said if the United States allowed the secession of its West Coast it would ""get rid of all these states that always vote democrat.""
The idea of an independent ""Cascadia"" has been dwelling on the fringes of B.C. politics for decades, with the Cascadia flag being a not-uncommon sight for car bumpers on both sides of the border.
The basic idea of Cascadia is to calve off B.C., Washington and Oregon to form a super-rich hyper-progressive enviro-state. May didn't go into detail on the Cascadia movement or its proposed outlines, but said that many ""academic papers"" had been written on the topic.
Awkwardly, given her health-care pledges, May's home province of B.C. was just forced to inaugurate a program of sending cancer patients for treatment in Washington State, as wait times had become dangerously high within B.C. hospitals.
But her promises of safer streets and stricter gun laws hold water; despite a recent uptick, the B.C. homicide rate is about half that of Washington or Oregon.
As for guns, Oregon permits both concealed-carry and open-carry of handguns - the latter doesn't even require a permit. In Canada, the carrying of a handgun anywhere outside of a licensed range is grounds for seizure by the RCMP, and the suspension of the owner's gun licence.

Harris does her constitutional duty by certifying election result:   The procedure was a moment of poignancy four years after Trump fomented a riot in the same building,2025,"And with two raps of a gavel, the ordeal was over.
Two months ago, Kamala Harris conceded the bitter 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. A wrinkle in the Constitution placed her in the awkward, heartbreaking position Monday that only three other people in nearly two-and-a-half centuries have endured: certifying the election of her rival for the presidency.
Each previous time an unsuccessful vice-president confirmed their loss in a presidential race was a moment of great poignancy. None was more powerful than this one, four years after Mr. Trump fomented a riot at, and ultimately inside, the very Capitol building where Ms. Harris formalized his victory in an orderly, even monotonous 40 minutes.
Decade after decade, this process has unfolded with little ceremony and even less attention; a president is elected in November and the Jan. 6 procedure is a mere formality, witnessed by hardly anyone beyond the walls of the Capitol. But because those walls were breached four years ago, and because the very term “Jan. 6” has become a symbolic date of democratic infamy, this year’s certification was freighted with impact and irony.
This time there was neither dissent nor disruption, neither vitriol nor violence.
No one called for the hanging of the vicepresident. No one called for the mobilization of the National Guard.
Ms. Harris began her duty by reciting words of democratic continuity at a near whisper. (“Pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the United States …”) She asked the four tellers – lawmakers chosen to tally the result – to ascertain that the votes that had travelled to the chamber in two mahogany boxes were “regular in form and authentic.”
Those were fighting words four years ago. They were mere ritual instructions this year.
“As we have seen, our democracy can be fragile,” Ms. Harris said in a video statement hours before travelling to Capitol Hill. “It is up to, then, each one of us to stand up for our most cherished principles.”
The duty Ms. Harris performed was set out in 1787, when the framers of the Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3, specified the states should “transmit sealed” accounts of the vote to the capital, where the “President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted.” (In the U.S., the vice-president is the president of the Senate.)
A half-dozen vice-presidents have found themselves in the position of confirming the results of elections in which they lost re-election to the vicepresidency. “I thought about ‘what if?’ that day,” former vice-president Dan Quayle, who along with president George H.W. Bush was denied re-election in 1992, said in an interview. “But I had a duty – and what I did was pretty perfunctory. We didn’t have the commotion there was in 2021.”
The Constitution doesn’t specify that vice-presidents should count the votes, rather than simply open the envelopes.
That question moved from the academic to the actual in 2021, when Mr. Trump, needing then-vice-president Mike Pence to nullify at least 36 electoral votes that had been cast for Joe Biden, prompted both a constitutional crisis and, when Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol, a law-enforcement crisis.
Mr. Trump believed, as he said in a tweet the day before the riot, that the vice-president “has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.” In a subsequent tweet at 1 a.m., he argued that if Mr. Pence “comes through for us, then we will win the Presidency … Mike can send it back!”
“All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN,” he said in yet another tweet. “Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!”
Mr. Pence asked aides to consult J.
Michael Luttig, a former federal judge with gold-plated conservative credentials, who responded, “You can tell the vicepresident that I said that he has no such authority at all.”
The 2022 Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, passed in the aftermath of the 2021 controversy, explicitly establishes that vicepresidents’ roles in this duty are simply clerical, and that they don’t have the power to overturn certified state results. Most constitutional experts believed that even under the previous law, passed in 1887, vice-presidents were powerless to alter election results.
“This is a ceremonial action and nothing more,” said Kyle Kopko, a political scientist at Pennsylvania’s Elizabethtown College. “Despite what the Trump people said, the vice-president cannot unilaterally exercise judgment over electoralcollege returns.”
The first sitting vice-president who lost a White House race and certified his rival as president was John C. Breckinridge in 1861. The last one before Ms. Harris was Al Gore in 2001. The only vice-president faced with this task who eventually became president was Richard Nixon.
“I do not think we could have a more striking and eloquent example of the stability of our constitutional system and of the proud tradition of the American people of developing, respecting and honouring institutions of self-government,” Mr. Nixon said in confirming the election of John F. Kennedy, despite aides’ pleas for him to contest the 1960 results. “In our campaigns, no matter how hard-fought they may be, no matter how close the election may turn out to be, those who lose accept the verdict and support those who win.”
Vice-president Hubert Humphrey lost the 1968 election to Mr. Nixon, but was travelling on the appointed day of certification, so Democratic Senator Richard Russell of Georgia was pressed into service for the certification of Mr. Nixon’s victory.
“When a vice-president presides over the certification of someone he or she ran against it can be an awkward moment,” said Joel Goldstein, a Saint Louis University emeritus law professor regarded as the leading expert on the American vice-presidency.
“But in a sense, it is a moment that reaffirms basic principles of American democracy, in belief in the rule of law, and in fair elections. It is what makes our country distinctive – the acceptance of democratic defeat. What better symbol of that could there be when a losing candidate recognizes the victory of a rival?”","The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.","Toronto, Ont.","Shribman, David",The Globe and Mail,"Jan 7, 2025",Political campaigns; Election results; Vice Presidents; Constitutional law; Presidential elections; Democracy; Certification; Political transition,
The evolution of an exciting young talent:   Harris Dickinson confirms the promise of his earlier films in 'Babygirl',2025,"Harris Dickinson was nervous to approach Nicole Kidman.
This would not necessarily be notable under normal circumstances, but the English actor had already been cast to star opposite her in the erotic drama ""Babygirl,"" as the intern who initiates an affair with Kidman's buttoned-up CEO. They'd had a zoom with the writer-director Halina Reijn, who was excited by their playful banter and sure that Dickinson would hold his own. And yet when he found himself at the same event as Kidman, shyness took over. He admitted as much to Margaret Qualley, who took things into her own hands and introduced them.
""She helped me break the ice a bit,"" Dickinson said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.
On set would be an entirely different story. Dickinson might not be nearly as ""puckishly audacious"" as his character Samuel but, in the making of ""Babygirl,"" he, Kidman and Reijn had no choice but to dive fearlessly into this exploration of sexual power dynamics, going to intimate, awkward, exhilarating and meme-able places. It's made the film one of the year's must-sees.
""There was an unspoken thing that we adhered to,"" Dickinson said. ""We weren't getting to know each other's personal lives. When we were working and we were the characters, we didn't veer away from the material. I never tried to attach all of the history of Nicole Kidman. Otherwise it probably would have been a bit of a mess.""
His is a performance that reconfirms what many in the film world have suspected since his debut seven years ago as a Brooklyn tough questioning his sexuality in Eliza Hittman's ""Beach Rats"": Dickinson is one of the most exciting young talents around.
Dickinson, 28, grew up in Leytonstone, in East London, the same neck of the woods as Alfred Hitchcock. Cinema was in his life, whether it was Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" films at the local multiplex or venturing into town to see the more social realist films of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach.
""Working class cinema interested me,"" he said. ""People around me that represented my world.""
Appropriately, his entry into making art started behind the camera, with a comedy web series he made as a kid, which he now describes as ""really bad spoofs"" of films and shows of the time. But things started to really click when he began acting in the local theatre.
""I remember feeling invigorated by it and accepted,"" he said. ""I felt myself for the first time and felt able to express myself in a way where I didn't feel vulnerable, and I felt alive and ignited by something.""
At around 17, someone suggested that he should give acting a try professionally. He hadn't even fully understood that it was a career possibility, but he started auditioning. At 20, he was cast in ""Beach Rats"" and, he said, just ""kept going."" Since then, he's gotten a wide range of opportunities in films both big, including ""The King's Man,"" and small. He's captivated as a male model in Ruben Östlund's Cannes-winning ""Triangle of Sadness,"" an estranged father to a 12-year-old in Charlotte Regan's ""Scrapper,"" an actor bringing an ex-boyfriend to life in Joanna Hogg's ""The Souvenir Part II,"" the charismatic, tragic wrestler David Von Erich in Sean Durkin's ""The Iron Claw"" and a soldier in Steve McQueen's ""Blitz.""
But ""Babygirl"" would present new challenges and opportunities with a character who's almost impossible to define.
""He was confusing in a really interesting way. There wasn't loads of specificity to it, which I enjoyed because it was a bit of a challenge to sort of pinpoint exactly what it was that drove him and made him tick,"" Dickinson said. ""There was a directness that unlocked a lot for me, like a fearlessness with the way he spoke, or a social unawareness in a way - like not fully realizing what he's saying is affecting someone in a certain way. But I didn't make too many rules for him.""
Part of the allure of the film is the ever-shifting power dynamics between the two characters, which could change over a scene.
As Reijn said, ""It's a cautionary tale about what happens when you suppress your own desires."" She was especially in awe of Dickinson's ability to make everything feel improvised and the fact that he could look like a 12-year-old boy in one shot and a confident 45-year-old man in the next.
Since its premiere at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year, the film has led to some surprisingly direct conversations with audiences spanning generations. But that, Dickinson understood, was what Reijn wanted.
""She really wanted to show the ugliness and the awkwardness of these things, of these relationships and sex,"" he said. ""That sort of fumbly version and the performative version of it is way more interesting, to me at least, than the kind of fantasized, romanticized, sexy thing that we've seen a lot.""
Dickinson recently stepped behind the camera again, directing his first feature film under the banner of his newly formed production company. Set against the backdrop of homelessness in London, ""Dream Space"" is about a drifter trying to assimilate and understand his cyclical behaviour.
The film, which wrapped earlier this year, has given him a heightened appreciation for just how many people are indispensable in the making of a film. He's also started to understand that ""acting is just being able to relax.""
""When you're relaxed, you can do stuff that is truthful,"" he said. ""That only happens if you've got good people around you: the director that creates the good environment. The intimacy co-ordinator facilitating a safe space. A co-worker in Nicole encouraging that kind of bravery and performance with what she's doing.""
Dickinson did eventually get to the point where he managed to ask Kidman questions about working with Stanley Kubrick and Lars Von Trier. But he also kept one shattering possibility between himself and his director.
""There is a world in which Samuel doesn't even exist. He's just a sort of a device or a figment for her own story. And I like that because it kind of means you can take the character into a very unrealistic realm at times and be almost like a deity in the story,"" Dickinson said. ""We didn't talk about it with Nicole.""

Limited choices force the reunion of roughriders and qb harris; Surprising that team didn't make change when Lions were shopping Adams around,2024,"When the B.C. Lions gave away quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. last month, the Saskatchewan Roughriders and quarterback Trevor Harris each effectively ran out of options for the upcoming CFL season.
That explains why the Roughriders extended Harris'contract through 2025, an inevitable signing first reported by 3DownNation's Justin Dunk. The Roughriders confirmed the deal Friday, but the fact Harris is returning isn't a surprise.
What is surprising? The Roughriders didn't even really try to make a change.
If the Roughriders had even considered replacing Harris, an oft-injured veteran of 12 CFL seasons who will turn 39 before training camp, they should have made a legitimate offer for Adams. They didn't. And that's inexcusable because Adams is coming off a strong season. Despite starting only eight games, he tossed 16 touchdown passes and ran for three majors.
While Harris was limited to 11 starts because of a knee injury, he tossed 20 touchdowns and ran for two more. Harris is a more accurate passer than Adams, but don't pretend he compares as a runner. They're both considered leaders by their teammates, praised by coaches and general managers alike, but one is seven years older than the other.
The Lions were looking to deal 31-year-old Adams this off-season because they're committed to promising Canadian quarterback Nathan Rourke, who rejoined B.C. after several NFL tryouts this past season and signed a long, expensive contract with his former team. Adams could have also rejoined a familiar team - he dressed for 11 games as Saskatchewan's short-yardage quarterback in 2017.
Lions general manager Ryan Rigmaiden said he spoke to every CFL team before dealing Adams to the Calgary Stampeders, with some extra urgency because the QB was due a substantial bonus in January. Calgary made the best offer and acquired Adams along with two draft picks for a package of three Stampeders draft picks.
Talk about a bargain-basement price for a starting quarterback! Essentially Adams switched teams for a second-round draft choice. Evidently there wasn't much of a market.
Rigmaiden said the four East teams were ""very, very set"" at quarterback while ""a handful of teams reached out to kick the tires.""
So the Roughriders, one of five teams in the West, kicked Adams'tires before turning away from a younger quarterback who could have served the franchise for another six or seven seasons, rather than the year or two they may get out of Harris.
Keeping Harris might not be a horrible idea for the short term. He was named a West all-star last season and wants to play into his 40s, but the Roughriders don't exactly have anyone warming up in the bullpen.
Last year's backup, journeyman Shea Patterson, had a so-so season while going 2-3-1 as a starter. Patterson's contract expires in February.
Third-stringer Jack Coan is under contract but isn't yet ready for prime time.
The only quarterbacks who could have potentially provided an upward swing for the Roughriders were Adams, Davis Alexander of the Montreal Alouettes and Tre Ford of the Edmonton Elks.
With the latter two on expiring contracts, Montreal anointed Alexander their new starter when they re-signed him and, in Edmonton, it's looking unlikely new Elks general manager Ed Hervey and his hand-picked head coach, Mark Kilam, are going to let Ford get away. There's really no place else for Ford to go anyway, now that the other eight CFL franchises have their starting quarterbacks under contract.
Maybe Roughriders general manager Jeremy O'Day and head coach Corey Mace made their decision based on the West semifinal, when Harris out-duelled Adams in a 28-19 Riders victory.
Adams threw for 317 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions while Harris'279 passing yards included one touchdown and zero interceptions.
O'Day and Mace heartily praised Harris in post-season gatherings with the media, raving about his attitude, and it seemed obvious about then the Roughriders were going to keep him. It's just weird that they didn't even seriously look anywhere else.
The list of potential acquisitions remains plentiful, but none are better than Harris. They include Jake Maier of the Calgary Stampeders, Jeremiah Masoli of the Ottawa Redblacks and Cameron Dukes of the Toronto Argonauts.
Through trades or free agency perhaps the Riders can put in place a decent backup - someone like Dukes, an intriguing prospect - if they would only make an offer.","The Vancouver Sun; Vancouver, B.C.","Vancouver, B.C.","Davis, Darrell",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 9, 2024",Teams,Nom: Calgary Stampeders; NAICS: 711211

"Limited choices force reunion of Roughriders, signal caller Harris; It's surprising they didn't make a change since Lions had shopped around Adams",2024,"When the B.C. Lions gave away quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. last month, the Saskatchewan Roughriders and quarterback Trevor Harris each effectively ran out of options for the upcoming CFL season.
That explains why the Roughriders extended Harris'contract through 2025, an inevitable signing first reported by 3DownNation's Justin Dunk. The Roughriders confirmed the deal Friday morning, but the fact Harris is returning isn't a surprise. What is surprising? The Roughriders didn't even really try to make a change.
If the Roughriders had even considered replacing Harris, an oft-injured veteran of 12 CFL seasons who will turn 39 before training camp, they should have made a legitimate offer for Adams. They didn't. And that's inexcusable because Adams is coming off a strong season. Despite starting only eight games, he tossed 16 touchdown passes and ran for three majors.
While Harris was limited to 11 starts because of a knee injury, he tossed 20 touchdowns and ran for two more. Harris is a more accurate passer than Adams, but don't pretend he compares as a runner. They're both considered leaders by their teammates, praised by coaches and general managers alike, but one is seven years older than the other.
The Lions were looking to deal 31-year-old Adams this off-season because they're committed to promising Canadian quarterback Nathan Rourke, who rejoined B.C. after several NFL tryouts this past season and signed a long, expensive contract with his former team. Adams could have also rejoined a familiar team - he dressed for 11 games as Saskatchewan's short-yardage quarterback in 2017.
Lions general manager Ryan Rigmaiden said he spoke to every CFL team before dealing Adams to the Calgary Stampeders, with some extra urgency because the QB was due a substantial bonus in January. Calgary made the best offer and acquired Adams along with two draft picks for a package of three Stampeders draft picks.
Talk about a bargain-basement price for a starting quarterback! Essentially Adams switched teams for a second-round draft choice. Evidently there wasn't much of a market.
Rigmaiden said the four East teams were ""very, very set"" at quarterback while ""a handful of teams reached out to kick the tires.""
So the Roughriders, one of five teams in the West, kicked Adams'tires before turning away from a younger quarterback who could have served the franchise for another six or seven seasons, rather than the year or two they may get out of Harris.
Keeping Harris might not be a horrible idea for the short term. He was named a West all-star last season and wants to play into his 40s, but the Roughriders don't exactly have anyone warming up in the bullpen.
Last year's backup, journeyman Shea Patterson, had a so-so season while going 2-3-1 as a starter. Patterson's contract expires in February.
Third-stringer Jack Coan is under contract but isn't yet ready for prime time.
The only quarterbacks who could have potentially provided an upward swing for the Roughriders were Adams, Davis Alexander of the Montreal Alouettes and Tre Ford of the Edmonton Elks.
With the latter two on expiring contracts, Montreal anointed Alexander their new starter when they re-signed him and, in Edmonton, it's looking unlikely new Elks general manager Ed Hervey and his hand-picked head coach, Mark Kilam, are going to let Ford get away. There's really no place else for Ford to go anyway, now that the other eight CFL franchises have their starting quarterbacks under contract.
Maybe Roughriders general manager Jeremy O'Day and head coach Corey Mace made their decision based on the West semifinal, when Harris out-duelled Adams in a 28-19 Riders victory.
Adams threw for 317 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions while Harris'279 passing yards included one touchdown and zero interceptions.
O'Day and Mace heartily praised Harris in post-season gatherings with the media, raving about his attitude, and it seemed obvious about then the Roughriders were going to keep him. It's just weird that they didn't even seriously look anywhere else.

"The best is yet to come, says re-signed QB Harris",2024,"Trevor Harris didn't have to think long and hard about where he wanted to play football in 2025.
And the Saskatchewan Roughriders didn't waste time in deciding who their quarterback will be next season as the Green and White officially signed Harris to a one-year contract extension on Friday.
""Based on the exit meetings that I had and how I felt toward the end of the season, I think it was pretty much a no-brainer,"" said Harris. ""I feel like I'm playing some of the best football in my career.
""And I think some of the best football that I'm going to play is right in front of me.""
The 38-year-old Ohio native was slated to become a CFL free agent in February and previously expressed his desire to be back in Saskatchewan for a third season after the Riders cleaned out their lockers following a loss to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West final.
Harris was glad the Roughriders - led by general manager Jeremy O'Day - felt the same way less than a month after their season ended.
""The big relief to me was this team didn't have to think very long who they wanted to be their guy,"" said Harris.
""I don't like to talk about myself personally very often, but that meant a lot to me personally, knowing that they knew that they didn't need to fish around and see what else is out there.
""They knew that they wanted me to be their guy.""
After initially signing a two-year deal with the Riders in free agency in 2023, Harris was limited to five games that season with a knee injury before restructuring his contract ahead of the 2024 season.
Last year, Harris was named a West Division all-star despite missing six games with a separate knee injury. In 11 starts, Harris threw for 3,264 yards, 20 touchdowns and nine interceptions while setting a franchise record for accuracy in a single season after completing 72.4 per cent of his passes.
Heading into 2025, Harris - whose career completion rate (70.74) is second best all-time among CFL quarterbacks - is excited to build on what was established with head coach Corey Mace and offensive coordinator Marc Mueller, who were hired last off-season.
""This is my first time since 2018 going into an off-season where I have the same offensive coordinator (and) the same system,"" said Harris, who has played for four other CFL teams since 2012. ""And so that's a tremendous advantage that I'm going to be able to hit the ground running.
""We can talk about 301-level ball stuff in an off-season, as opposed to trying to introduce me to what each formation means. There's a different level to that and I think with that, we can have higher expectations for a regular season.""
In fact, memories of that 2018 season came up on Friday as Harris recalled being a member of the Ottawa Redblacks, who kept the core of their team intact from 2017 before going on to win the East Division in 2018.
""We had a lot of injuries that year in Ottawa and I just remember saying to the guys, 'If we can just keep this squad together, keep the core group together, there's going to be magical things that happen the following year,'"" said Harris.
""And we kept the core intact and we added a couple pieces here and there.
""It was more or less just fine tuning the team, as opposed to overhaul.""
While the Redblacks lost in the Grey Cup to the Calgary Stampeders that season, Harris believes continuity was a big reason why Ottawa reached the championship game that season.
He has a similar sentiment this off-season with Saskatchewan, who finished second in the West Division last year and made the playoffs last year for the first time in three seasons.
""This team has that feel to me,"" said Harris, a two-time Grey Cup champion as a backup.
""I think we were ahead of schedule in terms of maybe how long people thought we were going to take to build something special.

Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Trevor Harris (7) throws the ball during first half CFL action at Mosaic Stadium on Saturday, October 12, 2024 in Regina.
After initially signing a two-year deal with the Riders in free agency in 2023, Harris was limited to five games that season with a knee injury before restructuring his contract ahead of the 2024 season.
Last year, the 38-year-old was named West Division all-star despite missing six games with a separate knee injury. In 11 starts, Harris threw for 3,264 yards, 20 touchdowns and nine interceptions while setting a franchise record for accuracy in a single season after completing 72.4 per cent of his passes.
And while Harris will be 39 years old when training camp rolls around next season, he never considered retirement this off-season.
""I know people will talk about the age,"" said Harris. ""I would tell you guys to not worry about the age; I'm going to be fine.
""Age and those things will not be a determining factor. You won't see a physical decline. Those are things that I've worked on for the last decade and a half to make sure that I could get to this point and not have a physical deterioration be why I have to be done playing football.
""The first goal that I wrote down this off-season just for anybody wondering, I'm playing all 18 games. And being under centre for all 18 games is a big thing that I want to be able to provide for a team.""
Looking forward, Harris - whose career completion rate (70.74) is second best all-time among CFL quarterbacks - is excited to build on what was established with head coach Corey Mace and offensive coordinator Marc Mueller, who were hired last off-season.
""This is my first time since 2018 going into an off-season where I have the same offensive coordinator (and) the same system,"" said Harris, who has played for four other CFL teams since 2012. ""And so that's a tremendous advantage that I'm going to be able to hit the ground running.
""We can talk about 301-level ball stuff in an off-season, as opposed to trying to introduce me to what each formation means.
""There's a different level to that and I think with that, we can have higher expectations for a regular season.""
In fact, memories of that 2018 season came up on Friday as Harris recalled being a member of the Ottawa Redblacks, who kept the core of their team intact from 2017 before going on to win the East Division in 2018.
""We had a lot of injuries that year in Ottawa and I just remember saying to the guys, 'If we can just keep this squad together, keep the core group together, there's going be magical things that happen the following year,"" said Harris. ""And we kept the core intact and we added a couple pieces here and there.
""It was more or less just fine tuning the team, as opposed to overhaul.""
Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Trevor Harris throws the ball during practice at Mosaic Stadium on Monday, August 12, 2024 in Regina.
While the Redblacks lost in the Grey Cup to the Calgary Stampeders that season, Harris believes continuity was a big reason why Ottawa reached the championship game that season.
He has a similar sentiment this off-season with Saskatchewan, who finished second in the West Division last year and made the playoffs last year for the first time in three seasons.
""This team has that feel to me,"" said Harris, a two-time Grey Cup champion as a backup. ""I think we were ahead of schedule in terms of maybe how long people thought we were going to take to build something special.
""I think the continuity, there's more to that than what people realize.""

He's back: Saskatchewan Roughriders re-sign quarterback Trevor Harris,2024,"Trevor Harris didn't have to think long and hard about where he wanted to play football in 2025.
And the Saskatchewan Roughriders didn't waste time in deciding who their quarterback will be next season as the Green and White officially signed Harris to a one-year contract extension on Friday.
""Based on the exit meetings that I had and how I felt toward the end of the season, I think it was pretty much a no-brainer,"" said Harris. ""I feel like I'm playing some of the best football in my career.
""And I think some of the best football that I'm going to play is right in front of me.""
The 38-year-old Ohio native was slated to become a CFL free agent in February and previously expressed his desire to be back in Saskatchewan for a third season after the Riders cleaned out their lockers following a loss to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West final.
Harris was glad the Roughriders - led by general manager Jeremy O'Day - felt the same way less than a month after their season ended.
""The big relief to me was this team didn't have to think very long who they wanted to be their guy,"" said Harris. ""I don't like to talk about myself personally very often, but that meant a lot to me personally, knowing that they knew that they didn't need to fish around and see what else is out there.
""They knew that they wanted me to be their guy.""

Here are the quarterback options for the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2025
Shire: 10 things the Saskatchewan Roughriders need to do this off-season",The Leader Post (Online); Regina,Regina,Taylor Shire,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Football,Nom: Saskatchewan Roughriders; NAICS: 711211
"Davis: Limited choices force CFL reunion of Saskatchewan Roughriders, QB Trevor Harris",2024,"When the B.C. Lions gave away quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. last month, the Saskatchewan Roughriders and quarterback Trevor Harris each effectively ran out of options for the upcoming CFL season.
That explains why the Roughriders extended Harris' contract through 2025, an inevitable signing first reported by 3DownNation's Justin Dunk. The Roughriders confirmed the deal early Friday morning, but the fact Harris is returning isn't a surprise What is surprising? The Roughriders didn't even really try to make a change.
If the Roughriders had even considered replacing Harris, an oft-injured veteran of 12 CFL seasons who will turn 39 before training camp, they should have made a legitimate offer for Adams. They didn't. And that's inexcusable because Adams is coming off a strong season, despite starting only eight games he tossed 16 touchdown passes and ran for three majors.
While Harris was limited to 11 starts because of a knee injury, he tossed 20 touchdowns and ran for two more. Harris is a more accurate passer than Adams, but don't pretend he compares as a runner. They're both considered leaders by their teammates, praised by coaches and general managers alike, but one is seven years older than the other.
The Lions were looking to deal 31-year-old Adams this off-season because they're committed to promising Canadian quarterback Nathan Rourke, who rejoined B.C. after several NFL tryouts this past season and signed a long, expensive contract with his former team. Adams could have also rejoined a familiar team - he dressed for 11 games as Saskatchewan's short-yardage quarterback in 2017.
Lions general manager Ryan Rigmaiden said he spoke to every CFL team before dealing Adams to the Calgary Stampeders, with some extra urgency because the QB was due a substantial contract bonus in January. Calgary made the best offer and acquired Adams along with two draft picks for a package of three Stampeders draft picks.
Talk about a bargain-basement price for a starting quarterback! Essentially Adams switched teams for a second-round draft choice. Evidently there wasn't much of a market.
Rigmaiden said the four East teams were ""very, very set"" at quarterback while ""a handful of teams reached out to kick the tires.""
So the Roughriders, one of five teams in the West, at most kicked Adams' tires before turning away from a younger quarterback who could have served the franchise for another six or seven seasons, rather than the year or two they may get out of Harris.
Keeping Harris might not be a horrible idea for the short term. He was named a West all-star last season and wants to play into his 40s, but the Roughriders don't exactly have anyone warming up in the bullpen. Last year's backup,journeyman Shea Patterson, had a so-so season while going 2-3-1 as a starter. Patterson's contract expires in February. Third-stringer Jack Coan is under contract but isn't yet ready for prime time.
The only quarterbacks who could have potentially provided an upward swing for the Roughriders were Adams, Davis Alexander of the Montreal Alouettes and Tre Ford of the Edmonton Elks.
With the latter two on expiring contracts, Montreal anointed Alexander its new starter when re-signing him and, in Edmonton, it's unlikely new Elks general manager Ed Hervey and his hand-picked head coach, Mark Kilam, are going to let Ford get away. There's really no place else for Ford to go anyway, now that the other eight CFL franchises have their starting quarterbacks under contract.
Maybe Roughriders general manager Jeremy O'Day and head coach Corey Mace made their decision based on the West semifinal, when Harris out-duelled Adams in a 28-19 Riders victory.
Adams threw for 317 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions while Harris' 279 passing yards included one touchdown and zero interceptions. O'Day and Mace heartily praised Harris in postseason gatherings with the media, raving about his attitude, and it seemed obvious about then the Roughriders were going to keep him. It's just weird that they didn't even seriously look anywhere else.
The list of potential acquisitions remains plentiful, but none are better than Harris. They include Jake Maier of the Calgary Stampeders, Jeremiah Masoli of the Ottawa Redblacks and Cameron Dukes of the Toronto Argonauts. Through trades or free agency perhaps the Riders can put in place a decent backup - someone like Dukes, an intriguing prospect - if they would only make an offer.

He's back: Saskatchewan Roughriders re-sign quarterback Trevor Harris
Here are the quarterback options for the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2025",The Leader Post (Online); Regina,Regina,"Davis, Darrell",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Teams,Nom: Calgary Stampeders; NAICS: 711211; Nom: Saskatchewan Roughriders; NAICS: 711211
Quarterback landscape offers options for Riders; Green and White could target a starter or acquire a backup for re-signed Harris,2024,"It appears the Saskatchewan Roughriders have retained their starting quarterback for the 2025 CFL season.
According to 3DownNation, the Green and White have re-signed veteran quarterback Trevor Harris to a one-year contract extension for next season. The 38-year-old was slated to become a free agent in February.
Harris will return for his third season in Saskatchewan after being named a West Division all-star last season, despite missing six games with a knee injury.
In 11 starts last year, Harris completed 260-of-359 passes for 3,264 yards, 20 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He registered seven wins and four losses in his starts while helping the Riders to a second-place finish in the CFL's West Division with a 9-8-1 record.
Since second-stringer Shea Patterson is still without a deal, the Riders will also need to secure a backup for next season.
With plenty of options out there, here are some names the Roughriders could target this off-season:
TRE FORD
If the Riders want to make a splash this off-season, they could lure Ford away from Edmonton and make him the starter for 2025 or even the heir apparent to Harris.
The 26-year-old dual threat is poised for a larger role in his fourth season in the league but might be comfortable staying in Edmonton with new head coach Mark Kilam. JAKE MAIER This move might make sense for the Green and White, considering Roughriders offensive co-ordinator Marc Mueller worked with Maier in Calgary for three seasons.
If the Riders were to sign Maier, many would want it to be in a backup role.
However, he's among the most experienced quarterbacks set to become a free agent this off-season and clearly needs a fresh start after how last season went down in Calgary.
SHEA PATTERSON
Along with retaining Harris, re-signing Patterson as the backup would be a logical move for the Roughriders.
The 27-year-old got his first six CFL starts last year while Harris was injured and showed some playmaking ability.
However, the Riders didn't trust him to run short yardage late in the season and that could be an issue if the team wants a backup quarterback to handle that.
CAMERON DUKES
A dual threat quarterback who has experience is Dukes, who was Toronto's starter while Chad Kelly was suspended for the start of last season.
Signing the 26-year-old Dukes could be a smart move for the Riders if they think he can evolve into a franchise guy.
DUSTIN CRUM
After Jeremiah Masoli got hurt in 2023, Crum came off the bench in Ottawa and made a name for himself right away.
While he's not the most prolific passer, his running ability mixed with his experience over the past two years in Ottawa could make him a good backup in Saskatchewan.
CODY FAJARDO
While Fajardo is still under contract in Montreal, it appears he will either have to take a pay cut or move elsewhere in 2025 after the Alouettes hitched their wagon to Davis Alexander.
And while it would be strange to imagine Fajardo being back in Saskatchewan after how things ended in 2022, he's among the most experienced quarterbacks who could be available this off-season.
NICK ARBUCKLE
No one expected Arbuckle to be on this list a year ago, but after his performance in the Grey Cup, there will likely be a few teams calling the 31-year-old to serve as a veteran backup.
However, if the Riders want the backup to handle short yardage, this signing wouldn't make a lot of sense.
JEREMIAH MASOLI
With Dru Brown in Ottawa, Masoli doesn't have a clear path to playing time for the Redblacks, so he might be looking for a new home in 2025.
The 36-year-old started a handful of games last year and might be forced into a backup role again this season.
However, he's still capable of starting anywhere, too.
MCLE OD BETHEL-THOMPSON The veteran Bethel-Thompson is a bit of a wild card and it's hard to say what his future holds after a strange year in Edmonton. CHRIS STREVELER, MATT SHILTZ, TOMMY STEVENS, DAKOTA PRUKOP, CALEB EVANS, DOMINQUE DAVIS These six aren't necessarily the next starting quarterbacks in the CFL, but they all have experience and are all capable of handling short yardage. tshire@postmedia.com","Leader Post; Regina, Sask.","Regina, Sask.",Taylor Shire,Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Free agency,
Roughriders reportedly re-sign QB Trevor Harris to extension,2024,"The Saskatchewan Roughriders don't appear be making a change at quarterback for the 2025 CFL season.
According to 3DownNation, the Green and White have re-signed veteran quarterback Trevor Harris to a one-year contract extension for next season. The 38-year-old was slated to become a free agent in February.
Harris will return for his third season in Saskatchewan after being named a West Division all-star last season despite missing six games with a knee injury.

Harris then guided the Roughriders to a win over the B.C. Lions in the Western semifinal before losing to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the West final.
In 172 career games since breaking into the league with the Toronto Argonauts in 2012, the Ohio native has thrown for 33,148 yards, 180 touchdowns and 84 interceptions. He previously joined the Roughriders during free agency in 2023 after spending the 2022 season and part of the 2021 season with the Montreal Alouettes following a trade from the Edmonton Elks.
The 6-foot-3, 212-pounder expressed his desire to be back in Saskatchewan for 2025 and appears to have been granted his wish. He was among 15 quarterbacks from across the CFL who are without contracts for next season including Tre Ford and Jake Maier.
Jack Coan and Michael Hiers are the other two quarterbacks under contract with Saskatchewan for next season while last year's backup Shea Patterson is currently without a contract for 2025.

"Manitoba landfill search identifies most likely location of remains of murdered First Nations women:   Deep section of Prairie Green landfill pinpointed as probable location of remains of Marcedes Myran and Morgan Harris will begin to be dug into this week, Premier Wab Kinew says",2024,"Manitoba is set to begin the most critical stage in the search to recover the remains of at least two First Nations women dumped by a convicted serial killer at a Winnipeg-area landfill, the Premier says.
In an exclusive interview ahead of a public announcement this week, Wab Kinew told The Globe and Mail that a targeted section of the Prairie Green landfill has now been pinpointed as the most probable location of the bodies of the victims, 26-year-old Marcedes Myran and 39-year-old Morgan Harris.
Starting at 6 a.m. Monday, multiple teams will work in shifts to move the refuse material into a large purpose-built facility, one of several new buildings erected on site. For the first time during the search, the debris from dozens of feet below the surface will then be sifted manually in the hopes of finding human remains.
Over the past two months, more than 18,000 cubic metres of detritus has been removed from the towering mound on top of the target area at the four-acre landfill, operated by Waste Connections of Canada Inc. in the rural municipality of Rosser, north of the provincial capital.
Work after this stage of the multiyear project, an effort that the Manitoba and federal governments have each committed $20-million toward, will depend on what is discovered in the coming weeks and months.
“As Premier, I just want to set some realistic expectations. This could be the difficult stage that carries on for quite a long time,” Mr. Kinew said, warning that the province is preparing for the excavation to continue all of next year, and potentially into 2026.
“But on a personal level, as one Manitoban looking at these fellow Manitobans who’ve lost their loved ones, I just hope the search is successful as soon as possible. These families have been through enough.”
Narrowing the search to events in May of 2022, when garbage was collected from receptacles in the precise parts of Winnipeg where the killer had dumped Ms. Harris and Ms. Myran’s remains, has required a lot of guesswork. But Mr. Kinew said evidence recently found at the marked site has been reassuring.
“We’ve been able to look at receipts and newspapers that we can legibly read,” he said. “They’re in the date ranges that we’re actually tracking, so it’s a real reason for hope.”
In late August of this year, after a months-long trial, 37-year-old Jeremy Skibicki was sentenced to life for the first-degree murders of Ms. Myran, Ms. Harris, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois and an unidentified woman whom First Nations elders have named Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, meaning Buffalo Woman.
Winnipeg police had located some of the remains of Ms. Contois, a member of Crane River First Nation, at a separate landfill shortly after the killer’s arrest. But remains of the other three women have never been found.
The bodies of Ms. Myran and Ms. Harris, both from Long Plain First Nation, are believed to have been dumped at Prairie Green, based on GPS information obtained by police from several garbage trucks. But Winnipeg police would not conduct a search of the landfill, considering it too dangerous.
Gary Anandasangaree, the federal Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister, has called the Winnipeg police’s handling of the case a “complete failure,” stating that it shows systemic issues.
Superintendent Cam MacKid has defended the service, describing the case as “one of the most complex investigations in Manitoba history,” where considerable safety risks for police led to the decision to forgo a search of the landfill.
Mr. Kinew said the Winnipeg police will not be involved directly in the current project.
Workers have so far not had any significant issues dealing with asbestos, chief among the contaminants that police had believed would make the search unsafe, he added.
Should human remains be found, a families-first identification and notification protocol will be established by the RCMP and the province’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. After that, the Manitoba government would likely help the families with a burial and funeral, Mr. Kinew said.
All the necessary structures for the search – such as changing rooms, lunch areas, new hydro lines, parking lots and access roads – have been completed, he told The Globe.
The facilities are intended to operate in all four seasons, including Manitoba’s harsh winter conditions. Although the targeted zone is not covered by a roof, Mr. Kinew said heavy equipment will be able to work despite the snow.
About 40 or so full-time and part-time workers – engineers, forensic anthropologists, managers and search technicians – have been hired, with the victims’ family members participating in job interviews. The bulk of the newly hired staff finished their training and were outfitted with personalized protective equipment this past week, Mr. Kinew added.
Cambria Harris, daughter of Morgan Harris, said these next steps are all that she has wanted for more than two years. “We haven’t had time to grieve because we’ve had to constantly scream for justice,” she told The Globe.
Jorden Myran, sister of Marcedes Myran, said she’s daunted by the intensity of the process.
“But I can finally see it all being near the end,” she said.
“We want to just finally bring our baby girl home,” added her grandmother, Donna Bartlett.
The Premier emphasized that no matter what lies ahead, this search has always been about healing for the families. “And it’s a healing journey for the whole province,” he said.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Durrani, Temur",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 2, 2024",Criminal sentences; Criminal investigations; Women; Forensic anthropology; Landfill; Murders & murder attempts; Native North Americans; Human remains,
