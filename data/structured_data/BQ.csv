Oilers welcome ekholm back to their lineup; Veteran defenceman returns to top pairing with Bouchard after sitting out with injury,2025,"It's difficult to measure just how much the Edmonton Oilers missed Mattias Ekholm.
Their key defender returned to the lineup for Tuesday's game against the visiting Utah Hockey Club after sitting out the previous six games because of injury.
And throughout much of that spell, Ekholm was still feeling the effects of a lingering illness that hit him before playing for Sweden at the 4 Nations Face-Off.
""A lot better, I've got my voice back,"" said the 34-year-old defenceman, who was back in the top pairing alongside Evan Bouchard during the morning skate at Rogers Place. ""I've been battling a little bit of a lower body injury and it's kept me out, obviously. But the guys have done a great job and I'm feeling better, so that's exciting.""
In all, he missed seven games since Feb. 1 after having played in every game up to that point. And of those seven, the three the Oilers lost were all by a single goal.
Though injuries happen to every team, and there is no way to determine whether Ekholm's presence would have made a difference in any of those narrow, low-scoring losses, the Oilers are just happy to have him back on their blue-line in time for the playoff push. And as well as his teammates did in attempting to fill the void, there is no real replacement for their most defensive-minded player.
""One thing is he's an exceptional penalty killer, so when he's not there that's a huge hole,"" said head coach Kris Knoblauch. ""The other one is just, he's a guy who's able to play against the other team's top units as a shutdown guy, but able to also play with our top guys and be able to transport the puck.
""He's not just an off-the-glass, keep-it-safe, not-make-a-mistake kind of guy, he's able to defend extremely well but able to get Leon (Draisaitl) and Connor (McDavid) pucks on good breakout passes.""
What Ekholm wasn't so good at was sitting back and watching it all happen without him. ""It's hard to watch on TV, I don't really like that at all,"" he said. ""You want to be part of it, obviously. Especially during the stretch run coming down here.
""I'm happy that I feel better. It was hard to watch just not being able to be part of it, but I thought they did a good job.""
He was out of the lineup for almost two weeks, which might have made up for whatever down time he and the other 4 Nations Face-Off participants didn't get when the rest of the NHL had a break in the schedule.
And it could have taken more of a toll than they expected.
""Probably,"" Ekholm said. ""I'm not saying because of that I got hurt, because that's two completely different things, but there was a big focus and you hadn't had best-on-best in so long, everybody's excited, amped up for it. And it's so short, you were there for, like, a week and then it's over, so I do think it took a little bit out of everybody.
""I definitely think it gave energy for guys, too. Whether it took from me or gave to me, that's impossible to answer. But I do think there was obviously a lot of energy going into that, and now I think I feel completely rested.""
But that doesn't mean the Oilers expect him to automatically be back to full speed.
""I assume there will be a lot of fluctuation with the D pairs,"" said Knoblauch.
""Ekhy hasn't played in a while, we've got three games in the next five days so his workload, I assume, will not be what it typically is. Playing a typical 22-25 minutes a night after he's had almost two weeks off is probably not the best recipe for him. We have to be careful of that because we do not want him to go back on injured reserve.""
Tuesday marked the first opportunity for Ekholm to get in the lineup with newly acquired defenceman Jake Walman, who was dealt by the San Jose Sharks at the trade deadline.
""I think there will be a lot of mixing and matching on who's playing where,"" Knoblauch said. ""Especially now with the abundance of left-handed defencemen."" gmoddejonge@postmedia.com x.com/@GerryModdejonge","Edmonton Journal; Edmonton, Alta.","Edmonton, Alta.","Moddejonge, Gerry",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Mar 19, 2025",Sports injuries; Hockey; Team sports,Nom: Edmonton Oilers; NAICS: 711211
Ekholm's return presents defensive dilemma for oilers; Does blueliner partner up with Bouchard again or would a different plan be better?,2025,"So when defenceman Mattias Ekholm returns from his illness and maybe an undisclosed injury as well - probably Thursday when the NHL's best team, the Winnipeg Jets, are here - does the veteran blueliner automatically go back with Evan Bouchard?
Or does the pairing of Jake Walman and Bouchard stay together for the Edmonton Oilers?
Maybe Ekholm plays on his off side with Darnell Nurse when he gets back after missing six games and likely a seventh when the Jets (98 points) come to town. Then the portable lefty Brett Kulak could anchor the third pair with a rotating set of righties - Ty Emberson, Troy Stecher and John Klingberg - to keep all three in the picture and playing some, with the playoffs a month away.
The left-shot Walman, who has also played right side with Nurse after the San Jose trade March 6, has played 52 minutes of five-onfive with Bouchard, outshooting the opposition almost two to one, but it might be hard to break up the Ekholm-Bouchard pairing that has been pretty exclusive for the 160 games the Swede has played with the Oilers since the Feb. 28, 2023, trade with Nashville.
Ekholm, who had his troubles at the 4 Nations Face-Off, and then was minus-7 in five games after the NHL break before starting his absence after the 6-2 Ducks blowout of the Oilers at Rogers Place two weeks ago, still is a staggering plus-82 in his 160 games with Edmonton.
Stecher took a forearm in the mouth from Matt Rempe in New York on Sunday, giving away 70 pounds and 11 inches to the 6-foot-9, 255-pound behemoth. After the players became entangled along the boards, Stecher - who is one of the NHL's true gamers at his size (battling for every inch of ice on every shift) - came back with cotton plugging both nostrils to staunch the blood flow.
The Oilers have been remarkably healthy on their back end the last three years but only Bouchard and Kulak have played all 67 games this season. Kulak hasn't missed an Oilers game since he was traded here on March 21, 2022.
MODEL OF CONSISTENCY Much has been made of Leon Draisaitl's NHL best 18-game point streak this season - one better than the Bruins' David Pastrnak - but more revealing is that Draisaitl's only been held off the scoresheet twice in the last 42 games since Dec. 3 in Las Vegas, so half a season. He didn't get a point against Buffalo in a 3-2 victory at Rogers Place on Jan. 25 and in Boston in a 4-0 Oilers win on Jan. 7.
He has 32 goals and 69 points in that 42-game span. He's been held without a point only 10 times in his 67 games.
Draisaitl's next goal will give him 50 for the fourth time (he had 55-, 52- and 50-goal seasons before this), and he's 12 ahead of the Leafs' William Nylander. The four 50s will tie him with Oilers Hall of Famer Jari Kurri.
As well, Draisaitl is four goals from 400 for his career.
THIS 'N' THAT? While Oilers goalie Stu Skinner's season (.897 save percentage) could certainly be better, he has 23 wins. That's the same as the much-hyped Igor Shesterkin, the guy he outplayed Sunday in New York. - Oilers winger Corey Perry's 15 goals (on 79 shots in 66 games) is the third most he's had in a season in the last seven years. He had 19 for Tampa in 2021-22 and 17 for Anaheim in 2017-18. He's playing 11:39 a game. - There's conjecture the Oilers may be recalling centre Derek Ryan from the farm (eight points in 13 games) but nothing official yet. They could seriously use a right shot for faceoffs on the fourth line with wingers Kasperi Kapanen and Mattias Janmark in that role the last while. Kapanen is at 39.5 per cent, Janmark 42.5 per cent. Ryan was 60.3 per cent on 229 draws when sent down. - One of the reasons Florida gave Jesse Puljujarvi a shot on their AHL farm team in Charlotte, then signed the ex-Oiler to an NHL contract, is Panthers general manager Bill Zito and Puljujarvi's agent Markus Lehto used to be friends and partners in a player agency called Acme World Sports. Puljujarvi has seven points in 12 games in Charlotte. - Artemi Panarin had 12 shot attempts against Skinner on Sunday at Madison Square Garden and six were blocked, with only four hitting the net. The Rangers' awful power play (0-for-3 and 1-for-20 over the past seven games) was predictable, in the middle and pass over J.T. Miller at the faceoff circle. He missed the net five times and had one blocked. Only two Miller shots got through to Skinner? Ex-Oiler Sam Gagner, who signed a pro tryout agreement on Ottawa's AHL farm team in Belleville to stay ready in case any NHL teams came calling, isn't listed on their roster any longer. He played 19 games with 10 points on the Sens' farm squad but decided to head home (Toronto area) after the trade deadline March 7 when nobody dealt for him.? While Oilers 2024 first-rounder centre/right-winger Sam O'Reilly is tied for third in scoring (68 points in 60 games) on probably the CHL's best junior team in London (10 losses, 318 goals for in 65 games), the most surprising story is the Oilers' seventh-round pick last June (196th overall), William Nicholl. He's fifth in team scoring with 53 points. - It's getting toward the end of the run for Oilers farmhand blueliner Phil Kemp, who is nursing a hand injury. The Bakersfield alternate captain is an unrestricted free agent July 1 and stalled in his attempts to get up to the NHL here. He could be looking for a new NHL organization. - With Utah here Tuesday, ex-Oil Kings winger Dylan Guenther is tied with Clayton Keller (24 goals) for tops on that club, which is in a dogfight for the second wild card in the West with Vancouver, Calgary and St. Louis. - When the Oilers acquired winger Roby Jarventie last July from Ottawa for Xavier Bourgault, they thought Jarventie, a former second-round pick, would be a possible call-up from Bakersfield during the season, but he hasn't played for months (knee). Now there's a Finnish newspaper report that the injured farmhand will be going home after the AHL season to play for his hometown (Tampere) Tappara club. The Oilers aren't so sure about that story. ""We're not worried,"" said Oilers assistant GM Keith Gretzky. Jarventie's contract ends after this season.?

Donald Trump has deprived Quebec sovereigntists of their strongest argument:   The Bloc Québécois is struggling as Canadians rally around the flag,2025,"Quebec sovereigntists have always been among the strongest supporters of continental free trade. Under Jacques Parizeau, the Parti Québécois backed the original 1989 Canada-U.S. free-trade agreement as an insurance policy against economic blackmail by the rest of Canada. Ever since, sovereigntists have favoured north-south over east-west trade links.
Thanks to free trade with the United States, Mr. Parizeau wrote in 1997, an independent Quebec would ""protect itself from any commercial or economic reprisals that Canada might contemplate following a declaration of sovereignty."" He likened the arrangement to ""calling on the Americans to protect us against the Canadians.""
That argument has now been turned on its head by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist swipes at his country's northern neighbour. Strengthening interprovincial trade ties has become a top priority, as has diversifying Canada's trade with the rest of the world. Quebeckers are suddenly feeling more Canadian than they have in a while.
This has left the Bloc Québécois struggling to strike the right tone amid a surge in Canadian patriotism. Slagging the rest of Canada does not quite cut it with Quebeckers when they are a feeling a wave of solidarity with their Canadian cousins. Mr. Trump's badgering about making Canada the 51st U.S. state has angered Quebeckers as much as other Canadians.
As recently as early January, the Bloc was riding high in the polls. Quebeckers had soured on the federal Liberals under Justin Trudeau while having never warmed to the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre. Trade woes were far from top of mind as debates over language, immigration and secularism continued to dominate Quebec politics.
Had a federal election been held then, the Bloc would have swept more than 40 of Quebec's 78 seats in Parliament and likely formed the official opposition in Ottawa. Now, the sovereigntist party has fallen into a distant second place behind the resurgent Liberals.
A Léger poll released on Wednesday found support for the Liberals under their new Leader, Mark Carney, at 36 per cent in Quebec. The Bloc and Tories were neck-and-neck at 25 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, according to the online poll of 1,007 Quebeckers. Bloc support is down 11 percentage points from December. Support for Quebec sovereignty, meanwhile, has dropped to 29 per cent from 37 per cent.
Of course, no one knows how long the Liberal bounce will last. Almost twice as many Quebeckers see Mr. Carney rather than Mr. Poilievre as the best leader to defend Canada against Mr. Trump. The former Bank of Canada governor's economic credentials remain his strong suit as Quebeckers focus as much as other Canadians on their economic security.
Still, Mr. Carney's unsteady French could prove to be a handicap on the campaign trail as the Bloc pitches a Quebec-first approach to dealing with the Americans. Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet warns that Ottawa could throw Quebec's dairy, forestry, aluminum and aerospace sectors under the bus as it seeks to protect Ontario's auto industry, Toronto-based banks and Alberta's oil patch.
After Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston recently urged Mr. Blanchet to abandon his ""small-mindedness"" and get behind a revival of the Energy East oil pipeline project abandoned in 2017, Mr. Blanchet dispatched a letter to Mr. Houston reiterating the Bloc's ""fierce opposition toward any project aiming to turn Quebec into a highway for the West's dirty oil and gas."" The Bloc Leader further charged that Mr. Houston's ""thirst for national unity did not exist when Quebec was asking for an equal distribution of asylum seekers among the provinces.""
Mr. Carney and Mr. Poilievre have pledged protection for supply management in Canada's dairy, poultry and egg markets in any Canada-U.S. trade negotiations. But that promise could fall by the wayside in the face of Mr. Trump's continued attacks on ""outrageous"" Canadian tariffs on U.S. dairy imports, above the relatively low amounts of foreign dairy products allowed to enter Canada tariff-free under the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. Mr. Trump seems particularly obsessed with Canada's dairy protectionism.
The Bloc has been road-testing a new slogan as it gears up for an imminent federal election call. The party recently ran newspaper ads with the tagline "" Qui va parler pour le Québec? "" (""Who will speak for Quebec?"") and questioning the commitment of other federal parties to standing up for the province in the face of Mr. Trump's tariffs.
""Quebec does not need to be part of Canada to ally itself with Canada and Mexico against the United States. That is a myth,"" Mr. Blanchet said this week. ""We do not need to submit to or be servile toward another country to carry our voice or ally ourselves with it.""
Still, there is no doubt that the end of an era in Canada-U.S. free trade has upended Quebec's sovereigntists. Mr. Trump has just ripped up their insurance policy.

"Bouchard's other racket:   Tennis isn't over, but Canadian sees future in pickleball",2025,"Eugenie Bouchard already has her own signature pickleball paddle. She's No. 17 in the rankings and appears regularly on the main court at events because she's always a big draw.
Just to be absolutely clear, though, she's not retired from tennis.
The 2014 Wimbledon finalist still practises on the tennis court, still competes at tennis events and still has a Women's Tennis Association ranking (No. 1,288).
The Canadian standout just has a new sport that's caught her attention. Bouchard is one of several familiar tennis names - including Jack Sock and Donald Young - crossing over to the pro pickleball scene as another career chapter.
Bouchard's yearlong changeover has been filled with lumps and losses in a very public setting as she learns the ins and outs - drop shots are a good thing - of a game that combines elements of tennis, badminton and table tennis.
""I'm on centre court,"" Bouchard explained ahead of Pickleball Slam 3, where she will team up with Andy Roddick on Sunday against Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf for a series in Las Vegas, to be aired on ESPN. ""Not because of my skill level in pickleball, but because of what I achieved in tennis and what I'm bringing over from tennis to the pickleball world.
""I didn't like it at first because I was losing, and I felt uncomfortable and awkward on the pickleball court. It was like: Put me on the last court so no one sees the train wreck that's about to happen. But I've slowly found my footing.""
Bouchard, who turns 31 on Feb. 25, was first approached by the Professional Pickleball Association Tour in 2023 while at the U.S. Open. The pitch: Help grow pickleball. She had played the sport with friends, but that was about it.
""After we got off the phone, I was like, 'She can make a difference in pickleball. She can really help bring us to another level as far as eyeballs,' "" explained Connor Pardoe, founder and CEO of the Carvana PPA Tour.
Bouchard signed a three-year deal (terms not disclosed) that includes provisions to compete in tennis.
She's played a role in the popularity of the PPA Tour, which merged with Major League Pickleball in February 2024. The circuits had more than 320,000 fans attend events last year.
Bouchard's still looking for her first win on the tour. But she maintains a sense of humour - and style. Case in point: After an exit last weekend in Tucson, Ariz., Bouchard, who was playing in a yellow New Balance top and a green-patterned skirt, wrote on social media: ""I may not have won the tournament but at least I had the cutest outfit.""
Her goals remain modest in pickleball, where she's 18-19 in singles, 8-18 in doubles and 8-19 in mixed doubles (paired with Sock last weekend).
""Success is going to a tournament and leaving with at least a win,"" said Bouchard, whose pink Versix Vector pickleball paddle is designed to take advantage of her tennis background. ""For the first couple of tournaments, I would play singles, doubles and mixed doubles and be 0-3. There's just something really defeating about flying to a city and being on that plane back having not even won one match. You're like: What am I doing here? So thankfully I started getting wins.""
Tennis remains in the picture for Bouchard, who broke onto the pro scene as a teenager and rose to No. 5 in 2014. That was a season where she made the Wimbledon final, losing 6-3, 6-0 to Petra Kvitova.
Bouchard has earned $6.9 million (U.S.) in prize money over a tennis career that's included plenty of highlights (semifinals at the 2014 Australian Open and French Open, representing Canada at the 2016 Rio Olympics) along with some difficult times (shoulder surgery, settling a liability lawsuit with the United States Tennis Association).
""I wouldn't say burned out,"" Bouchard said about why she decided to incorporate pickleball into her tennis career. ""I was just excited about a new opportunity.""
Sunday is quite an opportunity, too - a chance to team up with Roddick in a featured pickleball match against Agassi and Graf, two of her tennis idols.
""I don't even know how I got invited,"" Bouchard said. ""It's pretty crazy that I'm on the court with these three legends.""

"Donald Trump's threat to annex Canada is nonsense, Yves-François Blanchet says",2025,"Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state are nonsense.
""It's enough jibber-jabber,"" Blanchet proclaimed during an address on Trump's tariffs in Montreal on Tuesday. ""We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.""
If Canada were to somehow become the 51st state, Blanchet claimed it would be ""the most democratic.""
Blanchet's remarks followed Trump's announcement of a 25 per cent tariff on all steel and aluminum imports starting March 12, including those from Canada. With Quebec supplying 60 per cent of the aluminum used in the U.S., Blanchet dismissed the threat, arguing U.S. industries have few viable alternatives.
""It's terribly ill-advised,"" Blanchet told journalists Tuesday. ""Mr. Trump has no alternatives when he says 'we're doing aluminum ourselves.' Hey man, it ain't true. They will need it.""
He noted the tariffs might not happen, but if they do ""it will be terrible for the American economy.""
""I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.""
While Blanchet argued Trump's threats could be idle, he said Quebec and Canada must stand as unwavering and serious negotiators in the face of political instability.
""On the path of uncertainty, this is an opportunity to do more and do better. Less pageantry, fewer slogans, leave politics 100 per cent behind."" For this to happen, he said a federal election must take place as soon as possible.
Part of Blanchet's proposed negotiation strategy is to diversify Quebec's trading partners. ""Over the last weeks, I've met with representatives from France ... people from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan.""
Noting economic uncertainty breeds ingenuity, Blanchet asserted Quebec-centric industries such as aluminum must not be left out of Canada's economic planning in the coming weeks.
""Quebec's (economy) has come so far ... in the last 60 years,"" he said, pointing to the province's renowned mining, forestry, aluminum, artificial intelligence and aviation industries. ""We do not want that to be put on the table in the incoming negotiations in such a way that it would favour the automobile industry in Ontario, or oil and gas in Alberta, or anything which is not a characteristic of Quebec.""",The Montreal Gazette (Online); Montreal,Montreal,"Schertzer, Leora",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 11, 2025",Aluminum; Tariffs,

""I'm sure there will be somebody on his plane between a basketball game and a baseball game to tell him, don't do that, because it's bad for us. I'm sure that at the end of the day, the voice of reason will prevail.""
While Blanchet argued Trump's threats could be idle, he said Quebec and Canada must stand as unwavering and serious negotiators in the face of political instability.
""On the path of uncertainty, this is an opportunity to do more and do better. Less pageantry, less slogans, leave politics 100 per cent behind."" For this to happen, he said a federal election must take place as soon as possible.
Part of Blanchet's proposed negotiation strategy is to diversify Quebec's trading partners. ""Over the last weeks, I've met with representatives from France ... people from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan.""
Noting economic uncertainty breeds ingenuity, Blanchet asserted Quebec-centric industries such as aluminum must not be left out of Canada's economic planning in the coming weeks.
""Quebec's (economy) has come so far ... in the last 60 years,"" he said, pointing to the province's renowned mining, forestry, aluminum, artificial intelligence and aviation industries. ""We do not want that to be put on the table in the incoming negotiations in such a way that it would favour the automobile industry in Ontario, or oil and gas in Alberta, or anything which is not a characteristic of Quebec.""",The Montreal Gazette (Online); Montreal,Montreal,"Schertzer, Leora",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Feb 11, 2025",Aluminum; Tariffs,
"New CBC chief says it would be a 'tragedy' to dissolve the public broadcaster, could devastate TV and film sector:   Marie-Philippe Bouchard said that 'change is coming' at the CBC and she is currently touring the country to listen to a variety of voices",2025,"The new head of CBC/Radio Canada, in her first public speech since taking the post three weeks ago, says dissolving the CBC would be a tragedy and have a devastating impact on the production of TV shows and films in Canada.
Speaking at an Ottawa conference for the film and TV industry, Marie-Philippe Bouchard, the new president and chief executive officer, said she fears the breakdown of Canada's media ecosystem in the face of competition from foreign streaming platforms. She warned that removing the public broadcaster could lead to the collapse of that ecosystem.
The Conservatives have said they would cut funding for the CBC, while preserving French services, if they form the next federal government.
Bouchard, who spent 29 years working for the public broadcaster before becoming president and CEO of TV5 Québec Canada, said the CBC has to ""evolve"" and ""figure out how to represent everybody.""
""But I think it would be a tragedy to dissolve something we've all inherited,"" she said.
Bouchard was speaking at Prime Time, an annual conference in Ottawa run by the Canadian Media Producers Association, where delegates have a chance to pitch their ideas to providers such as Amazon Prime Video and Lionsgate Canada.
The CBC is the biggest commissioner of independent Canadian productions in the country, and conference delegates expressed concern that cuts in CBC funding could hit TV and film production hard.
""They are the biggest buyer in the country. Their whole prime time schedule is Canadian content. Losing their support would be devastating for the independent production community,"" said Nicole Mendes, vice-president of scripted development at Lark Productions, which made Allegiance , a highly-rated police drama set in Surrey, B.C., that airs on CBC.
Bouchard said with ""less money,"" CBC/Radio Canada and other Canadian companies are having a hard time competing with big international streaming platforms, such as Netflix.
""My fear is having a breakdown of the media fabric in Canada, the ability for Canadian-owned media, and all the producers that want to be on those Canadian media, to actually connect with audiences and not be overwhelmed by the force of international platforms, both in terms of entertainment but also in terms of information,"" she said.
Bouchard said the situation is ""solvable not by the actions of the public broadcaster alone, but if you take the public broadcaster out of the equation, there's a big risk of collapse.""
She would not get drawn into the debate about the Conservative pledge to cut the CBC's funding saying ""I'm not going to do any political talk here today or anywhere – ever. I'm not. But I'm aware that there is a debate.""
Her predecessor, Catherine Tait, earned a rebuke from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre two years ago when she accused him of stoking criticism of the CBC, which is meant to be politically impartial.
Senator Andrew Cardozo, who initiated a debate in the Senate on the CBC's future, said Bouchard is ""walking a tightrope"" as criticisms of the CBC are very political, but ""she is obligated to respond in a totally non-political way.""
He said Trump's comments about a 51st state create an opportunity for the CBC to be integral to Canada's national identity.
Bouchard said when she agreed to take the job, Trump had yet to make quips about Canada becoming the 51st state.
""I didn't know we would be in a kind of psychodrama,"" she said. Bouchard said his remarks have catalyzed Canadians to come together and the CBC has a role in cementing the Canadian identity.
""When you have not-so-friendly neighbours talking about a 51st state, I think it's really important that we focus on maintaining that strength and that distinctiveness of our culture, our common culture,"" she said.
Bouchard said that ""change is coming"" at the CBC and she is currently touring the country to listen to a variety of voices.
The Liberal government has been criticized for failing to update CBC/Radio Canada's 1991 mandate before Bouchard took the helm this month for a five-year term. She sat on a government-appointed panel looking at a revised mandate last year before she took the top job.
Broadcasting experts said the government should have approved a new funding model for the public broadcaster so that it does not rely on advertisements for revenue in news and current affairs programs, and to shore it up for the future.
But with the Liberal Party embroiled in a leadership race after the resignation of Justin Trudeau, and the proroguing of Parliament until Mar. 24, the chances of legislation to update the CBC's mandate being passed before the next election are slim.

"Blanchet is right: 'absurd'to ban energy shipments; Let's not turn a duel into a war, writes Don Braid",2025,"In all the political wind over tariffs, there's a breeze of sanity from Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet.
Blanchet says it would be ""absurd"" to ban energy shipments to the U.S. during the trade and tariff dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.
That aligns him with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, the only other leader who says clearly that energy cuts should be off the table, never to be mentioned again.
Blanchet is talking about both electricity and oil. But don't get the notion he's any friend of Alberta, or some kind of separatist ally with sovereignty-loving Smith.
Blanchet, in fact, appears as hypocritically green as other Quebec politicians, rejecting oil and gas pipelines from the West while Quebec cashes a $13.6-billion annual equalization cheque.
Yet he's right about the danger of cutting energy shipments to the U.S., whether it's Quebec electricity or western oil and gas.
""If you disrupt the habit of Americans sourcing energy from Quebec and Canada, once they have found other sources of supply, you will be in a very disadvantageous position to negotiate new contracts,"" Blanchet said.
""In the long term, it's a bit of a scorched-earth policy.""
That's one solid point. But Blanchet also touches on a far more serious possibility.
He says Americans regard our oil as ""somewhat in their backyard."" This makes the threat of cutting supply even less ""wise.""
Trump has just declared a national energy emergency in the U.S. He wants oil production vastly increased. For him, this is a strategic imperative.
He keeps insisting that America has more oil than anywhere in the world, which isn't true - but he clearly wants it to be.
Maybe the president already considers our huge reserves to be American.
Trump could view cutting oil shipments to the U.S. as an extremely hostile move. And he's the president who thinks Canada should be the 51st state.
Other premiers and the feds may have their doubts about cutting off energy, but they keep refusing to rule out the tactic.
Smith is clear - don't do it. This is the only sane view. A duel where one combatant pulls out a new weapon can become a war.
Smith has another concern; the impression that she's seeking a tariff ""carve-out"" specifically for oil and gas.
This damaging idea grew from her suspicion that Ottawa will impose an oil export tax if oil is spared from tariffs.
That in turn fostered the impression that she's pressing for an oil exemption in her private talks with U.S. leaders. Asked about this Tuesday, Smith said it's not true.
""I've been asking for recognition that this important trade relationship means Canada should get a carve-out, that Canada has got a special integrated relationship with the U.S., that Canada buys more U.S. goods and services than any other country in the world, that Canada is able to singularly provide that security to the United States.
""I think that's the true Team Canada approach. I don't anticipate a carve-out (for oil), I never have, but I have been asking for Canada to have a carve-out on the basis of this special relationship.""
Smith still puts her faith in personal diplomacy. But the wind is blowing against her as premiers line up to support retaliation.
Quebec Premier François Legault, for one, says he excludes no form of retaliatory measures against the United States in the event of tariffs It's impossible to know what Trump will do.
Keeping track of his twists is like following a bumblebee through a field of daisies, as Canadian columnist Graham Thomson once wrote in another context.
But 82 per cent of Canadians agree with a tough stand, according to a new Ipsos poll.

"What a Bloc Québécois opposition would mean; Blanchet could present party as voice of Quebec, strengthen case for separation",2025,"The status quo of Liberals and Conservatives at the helm of Canadian federal politics may soon be disrupted.
Conservatives are leading the polls in every province except Quebec. But the Bloc Québécois, a party that only contests seats in Quebec, could emerge as the official opposition.
The latest 338Canada data suggests the party could place second with 45 seats, far behind the Conservatives'projected majority of 237. The Liberals, polling at a historic low, are on pace for 37 seats, while the NDP is hovering in fourth place with a projected 22 seats.
The Bloc acting as the official opposition is not without precedent. The party held the post from 1993 to 1997 and played a major role in Quebec's pivotal 1995 referendum on independence.
One Liberal riding has already flipped to the Bloc. In September, LaSalle-Émard-Verdun, which had been a Liberal stronghold since it came into effect in 2015, voted Bloc in a federal byelection.
If the Bloc were to reclaim its position as official opposition in the coming election, what would it mean for Canadians this time around? THE LIKELIHOOD OF SEPARATION Quebec's separatist movement has resurged under the Parti Québécois's charismatic leader, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, who has promised to hold a referendum if he becomes premier in the 2026 provincial election.
The combination of a Bloc official opposition under Yves-François Blanchet in Ottawa and PQ leadership in Quebec would make another referendum plausible, according to Jérémy Elmerich, a political science lecturer at the Université du Québec à Montréal, whose PhD focused on the Quebec referendums.
""If the Conservative party wins by a wide margin and the opposition is divided, with the Bloc forming the official opposition, then the Bloc will be able to play the narrative of Canada against Quebec and present itself as the voice of Quebec,"" Elmerich said.
He added if all the other provinces are unified under the Conservatives, it would uphold Quebec's case for being a distinct society.
""If there is no ... credible political alternative to the Conservatives, then it would strengthen the case for a referendum on sovereignty, with the federalists having very few political arguments to oppose sovereigntists to defend Canada's unity,"" Elmerich said.
Former Bloc official opposition leader Gilles Duceppe is less certain.
""We never know. I've always said that in politics there's nothing surprising, only unexpected things,"" he told The Gazette when asked about the likelihood of separation.
""In 1973, the PQ had six members elected, and the Liberals under Robert Bourassa, 102,"" he said. ""The journalists wouldn't have written that in three years the PQ will be in power.""
MORE THAN JUST A SEPARATIST PARTY Voters may opt for the Bloc Québécois solely because they are unhappy with the alternatives, according to Elmerich.
""The Bloc Québécois does not only gather people who support sovereignty, but also people who just oppose both the Liberals and the Conservatives,"" he said, adding that the party has an incentive to appeal to Liberal voters.
And there is more to Quebec nationalism than separatism: Duceppe noted that ""on social matters, Quebec tends to lean left."" For example, the Bloc pushed to increase seniors'pensions, which the Liberals vetoed.
However, one defining feature of present-day Quebec nationalism is the fight against multiculturalism, according to UQAM political science professor André Lamoureux.
""The Bloc is fighting against the multiculturalism conception of the federal states. The Bloc Québécois has a more universalist conception of society,"" he said, defining ""universalism"" as assimilation into Quebec culture.
But the Bloc's platform will continue to be shaped by how the party can contrast against the Conservatives, according to Elmerich.
""The discourse they can hold in opposition to the Liberal party will certainly not be the same as the one they will pose to Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives,"" Elmerich said.
""They may appear or may sound more inclusive in the next few months than they were in the last.""
Despite the potential range of the Bloc's platform, Quebec nationalist parties have always struggled to reach the province's anglophones and immigrants, Elmerich said.
""A vote for the Bloc doesn't obviously mean a vote for sovereignty, but can they reach people in the anglophone community or immigrants? It's always a question."" THE BLOC'S RECORD AS OFFICIAL OPPOSITION While the Bloc's legacy from the 1990s is defined by the referendum, Duceppe remembers the party's many other accomplishments from his time in office.
""The anti-gang law was proposed by the Bloc, and all the other parties were against it,"" Duceppe said.
""I was threatened by the Hells Angels at the time. My wife also for a month.""
He also recalls doing heavy lifting on the sponsorship scandals, negotiating with then-prime minister Stephen Harper for the 2007 budget, and supporting then-PM Jean Chrétien through conflict in Iraq, beginning in 2002.
""We have more in common with the rest of Canada than differences existing between us. Because we're a democracy,"" Duceppe said.
""We had a good link with the rest of Canada, even if we don't have the same goals."" 'NO USEFUL PURPOSE' Former NDP opposition leader Tom Mulcair believes the Bloc has overstayed its welcome, saying the party today ""serves no useful purpose.""
""In the early days ... they were channelling the deep resentment and anger that Quebec has felt about the rejection of Meech and Charlottetown and what that implied for recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. That was the high-water mark for the party.""
Mulcair pointed out that the current polls may not hold up during the election, and voter opinions could dramatically change closer to election day.
""If Quebecers realize that these Conservatives are about to score a massive majority, they're going to want to have strong people at the cabinet table.""
Mulcair says he believes the role of official opposition, which gets the most number of opposition days in Parliament and often gets to set the agenda, would be wasted on the Bloc.
""The official opposition's two main roles are to hold the government to account and to be a government in waiting. Since the Bloc Québécois doesn't even think of wanting to be the government because they can't be, then half of the role of the official opposition is lost.""","Montreal Gazette; Montreal, Que.","Montreal, Que.","Schertzer, Leora",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Jan 14, 2025",Provincial elections; Multiculturalism & pluralism; Referendums; Voters; Political leadership; Sovereignty,

"Voters 'don't have to fear us,' Bloc Québécois says:   Leader says party would be a positive force as Opposition",2024,"Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet says he's staying modest about the prospect of his party forming official Opposition in the next federal election, although it would be a ""spectacular"" result.
""I refuse to see the election in terms of pride or a trophy, or to claim to be part of history,"" he told The Canadian Press in a year-end interview.
As Justin Trudeau's minority government teeters and polls point to a possible collapse of the Liberal vote, Blanchet said he's staying focused on earning the confidence of Quebecers. ""Quebecers will give us a mandate, and we'll carry it out responsibly by always repeating to ourselves, I hope, that we have to live with modesty,"" he said.
The most recent projections from poll aggregator Canada338.com show that if an election were held today, the Conservatives led by Pierre Poilievre would win a crushing majority of 232 seats. The site suggests the Bloc is running a distant second with 45 seats - but ahead of the Liberals with 39, the NDP with 25, and the Greens with two.
If such a scenario were to come to pass, the anti-monarchist, Quebec-focused sovereigntist party would become His Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and Blanchet would get the keys to Stornoway, the Opposition leader's official residence.
""If that happens, I can only say that we respect institutions ... while having already said that the Senate should be abolished, that the monarchy in Canada should be abolished,"" he said, adding, ""but we are not there to break the toys.""
Blanchet said his party would carry itself with a ""positive and constructive attitude,"" while continuing to advocate for Quebec sovereignty.
""We can expect that, when an issue affects all of Canada, including Quebec, we will do our job,"" he said. ""When an issue affects just Quebec, or almost just Quebec, we're right in our business."" The party may be ""more discreet,"" however, on issues that impact the rest of English Canada, he said.
Blanchet said his party would continue to speak only French in the House of Commons. But when asked if he had a message to English Canada, he said ""people don't have to fear us.""
He said the party's position on many issues are well-known, ""and we're not going to pull the ideological rabbit out of the hat."" What's good for Quebec is also, often, good for Canada, he added. As examples, he cited his party's recent battles to raise Old Age Security for younger seniors, to ensure supply management is protected in trade agreements, and to remove an exemption for religious speech in the section of the Criminal Code dealing with hate speech.
Blanchet laughed when asked if he'd prefer a medium-sized Bloc contingent that holds the balance of power or a larger number of MPs in a majority Parliament. ""An interesting trap question,"" he said. Either scenario can be worked to his party's advantage, he said, adding that he is focused on getting as many MPs elected as possible.
""A very strong Bloc Québécois delegation forces a government, any government, to respect what Quebec wants,"" he said. ""And the proof is in front of us: Justin Trudeau's government didn't respect Quebec and it's possible they'll find themselves with a historically low number of seats in Quebec in the next election."" Quebec, he said, ""is making them pay the price.""
The Bloc Québécois has formed the Official Opposition only once before, in 1993, after Lucien Bouchard left Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives to found the party.
The Bloc, in its first general election, won 54 seats, behind Jean Chrétien's Liberals with 177. The incumbent Conservatives were all but wiped off the board, going from a majority government to finishing fifth with two seats.
Trudeau's minority government seems all but certain to fall now that the NDP has announced that it will vote to bring down the government. Blanchet, who has voted against the government since the fall, said he would not support the Liberals under any circumstances and confirmed he would also vote to head for an election at the first opportunity.
That means he's resisting the ""clear temptation"" to help the government survive long enough to allow his bill C-282, which protects supply management on dairy, poultry and eggs, to get adopted in the Senate.
There's a lot more at stake in an election than just supply management, he said. ""It's the whole of trade, the whole of the economy, the whole of international relations, the whole of the treatment of the most disadvantaged, housing, homelessness.""
Blanchet says he doesn't regret letting the Conservatives paralyze the work of the House of Commons during the fall. Unblocking Parliament without getting his demands met would have made his party as weak as the NDP, he said.
If there is one thing he would do differently, he said, it would be to be more patient. Politicians, he said, should better explain their thinking rather than ""trying to have the killer line of the day.""
""Our work doesn't mean anything if people don't understand us,"" he said.

Said Miller: ""Are Bouchard's teammates actually okay with him playing like this all the time?""
Are Bouchards teammates actually okay with him playing like this all the time? #Oilers
- Liam (@millerthegoat9) December 18, 2024
My take
1. Miller is evidently a Vancouver Canucks fan so I'd normally ignore his partisan take, save for the fact there's a large faction of Edmonton Oilers fans who aren't at all OK with Bouchard and see him as more of a liability than an asset. Some in that group would prefer the Oilers not enter into a new contract with Bouchard, and certainly not a long-term one with a gargantuan cap it.
That said, I'm not sure if any of them agree with Miller's assessment of Bouchard on the goal against in the viral video. On the play, Leon Draisaitl turned over the puck, Mattias Ekholm got beat down the wing and Reinhart made a rare shot, banking in a shot from behind the net off the goalie's head. Bouchard's job on the play was to cover off the slot, as the real potential threat was a Florida danger man moving in to take a pass from Reinhart.
2. The local angst about Bouchard reached new heights with his iffy play against Florida, where he made a number of players directly leading to goals against. He toe-picked and turned over the puck on the first goal against, gave up the puck later in the game for another. Next he got beat on the pass on Florida's winning goal. It was a bad game, a rough night. His critics were quite rightly out in full force.
This seems as good a time as any to address Bouchard's value as a player.
3. Having watched every game of Bouchard's NHL career, and done intensive video analysis of every single Grade A shots he's been on the ice for and against, I'll be pleased if the Oilers sign him to a new eight-year deal. I'll be ecstatic if they can get him for $9 million per year, but expect he'll get paid more than that.
As crazy as he makes some fans, as lazy and languid as he can look on the ice, and for all his defensive mistakes, Bouchard has been the best defenceman on the Oilers for the past two years. He creates much, much more on the attack than he gives up in his own end.
He's not a standard run-of-the-mill d-man. He mainly succeeds with outstanding stretch passes and blistering shots, not blistering hits and extraordinary defensive intensity.
This was simply disgusting by Evan Bouchard ??
- Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) November 20, 2024
4. For the past six weeks, Bouchard's defensive partner Mattias Ekholm have been slumping, leaking too many Grade A shots against. Ekholm's game dropped off just as Darnell Nurse's game picked up, but the big Swede hadn't been his 2023-24 self for awhile now.
Defensive slumps happen to players, often related to injury. But Ekholm's slump hasn't made it any easier for Bouchard, who has leaked a few too many Grade A shots this year himself. He's making significantly more defensive gaffes this year than he did last year.
When we look at Grade A shots at even strength, he made just 1.48 per game last year, but he's making 1.84 per game this year.
In the 2004 playoffs, however, Bouchard was not only a brilliant offensive player, he played crackerjack defence against tough competition, making just 1.13 mistakes per game ES on Grade A shots. Thtat is the same low rate of mistakes we've seen from stalwart defenders like Adam Larsson and Kris Russell.
In other words, when it mattered most, under the most pressure, against the toughest competition, Bouchard absolutely crushed it as an even strength player.
This is why I put little weight in the harsh opinion of his critics. They're evidently unaware of his playoff excellence, or downplay it. I do neither. I give him full credit for it. He played like a superstar during hockey's biggest tournament. Damn right I want him signed up long term.

"Oilers prove point, Bouchard has the Blues, and poor Hyman",2024,"If you told the Edmonton Oilers, before they set out on their four-game journey of discovery through the heart of the NHL's heavyweight division, that they'd go 3-1 and outscore the other guys 20-11, they'd have been good with that.
With good reason.
It ended poorly, with a wildly entertaining 6-5 loss to the Florida Panthers, in which Edmonton's offence had one of its best nights of the season and still couldn't outscore the mistakes, but that was a solid run against the NHL's elite.
Beating Tampa Bay (2-1), Minnesota (7-1) and Vegas (6-3) showed the Oilers exactly where they are. At their best, as far as mid-December hockey goes, they belong among those elite teams.
And that's all they need to be when the playoffs are still four months away.
A dozen things can and will happen between now and April that will determine whether the Oilers are legitimate Stanley Cup contenders again, but we've seen enough to know that they can get there from here.
Takeaways from Monday's road hockey loss to Florida:
THE BOUCHARD BLUES
Maybe he's fighting through some kind of tweak after being taken out awkwardly late in the Minnesota game, but Monday was one of those nights Evan Bouchard should have just stayed in bed.
He opened the game by blowing a tire at the offensive blue line seconds into an Oilers power play, setting up a shorthanded breakaway goal for Jesper Boqvist. Then he takes a penalty to wipe out what was left of the man advantage.
Tough start. And it didn't get better. He was on the ice for all three of Florida's third-period goals and just to top things off, it was his shot that deflected off a Florida player and hit Zach Hyman in the face.
""I've definitely seen Evan play a lot better than that,"" said head coach Kris Knoblauch. ""It was a tough night but he doesn't have those very often. We had some other guys who didn't play their best, either. I'm not putting this on Evan.""
This happens from time to time when a player who is just OK defensively commands major ice time because of how good he is offensively, the problem is that his offence has taken a step backward from last season.
He has 23 points in 31 games, which is closer to the pace that netted him 40 and 43 points in his first two full seasons and a long way from when he spiked to 114 points in 106 regular season and playoff games last season.
Other than costing him a lot of money as he plays out the final year of his bargain basement $3.9 million deal, it's a vital weapon the team doesn't have access to at the moment.
""A lot of everything,"" Bouchard said, when asked what he needs to work on after the Florida mess. ""Not acceptable tonight.""
Maybe he can flick the switch like Zach Hyman did, but right now he's searching for answers at both ends of the ice.
WHAT A NIGHT
It went from one end of the spectrum to the other for Hyman on Monday. He scores once in the first period and again in the second to give him seven goals in six games since returning from an injury.
It just illustrates how stupid it was for the Four Nations Face Off teams to be announced two and a half months before the tournament.
Unfortunately, the night took a painful turn for Hyman when a Bouchard shot from the point deflected up into his face and he had to leave the game, pouring blood, for repairs.
He returned in a full face shield and almost competed the hat trick, delivering a classic hockey player moment.
""The fact he skated to the bench under his own power surprised me, I thought he'd be lying on the ice,"" said Knoblauch. ""But obviously he's tough. I saw him between periods and we're very fortunate it didn't get more of his head that it did.
""We're lucky because he's a very important part of our team and all things considered it could have been worse.""
A LITTLE SENSITIVE?
Speaking of bad starts, referee Kelly Sutherland wasted no time impacting the hockey game. He flagged Darnell Nurse for tripping with four minutes left in the first period, which was fine, but then added an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty when Nurse complained about it.
You would hope a referee would have thicker skin in that situation, but nope.
It left the Oilers short for four-straight minutes and lead to a Florida power play goal.
Nurse needs to zip his mouth in that situation but a referee also has to be poised enough to take a little grief. It's an NHL hockey game, for heaven sakes, not a Grade 3 gym class.
""You're not doing yourself any favours yelling at the referee,"" said Knoblauch, well aware that you can never win an argument with a referee. ""You're either going to take another penalty, or a 10 (misconduct). And if you're not going to the box it's more likely that you're upsetting the referee and he's going to call another penalty later in the game.
""No matter who you are it doesn't help you at all yelling at the referees.""

"Bloc Québécois Leader calls for Trudeau to dissolve Parliament, seek new mandate:   Yves-François Blanchet says the Prime Minister must call an election in January",2024,"Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has no legitimacy left to govern and must call an election in January.
The Bloc leader said with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump threatening tariffs that could destroy the Canadian economy, the unstable situation faced by the governing Liberals cannot be allowed to stand.
""If he wants to stay where he is now, he needs a mandate, and he does not have one as we speak, "" Mr. Blanchet told reporters, speaking in English.
Mr Blanchet's comments came the day after Chrystia Freeland's stunning departure from the Liberal frontbenches knocked the minority Liberal government wildly off course.
She communicated her decision to quit as finance minister and deputy prime minister to Mr. Trudeau on Monday morning and then publicly through a sharply worded letter.
Among other things, she suggested she and Mr. Trudeau were not aligned on the best course for the country's finances in the face of Mr. Trump's tariff pledge.
Ms. Freeland juxtaposed what she called the need to keep Canada's ""fiscal powder dry"" to deal with the potential consequences of a Trump administration with ""costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford and which make Canadians doubt that we recognize the gravity of the moment"" – a reference many understood to be to the decision by the Liberals to put in place a two-month tax holiday on certain consumer products and services.
Her departure reignited calls from the Liberal backbenches for Mr. Trudeau to step down as Leader, but Mr. Blanchet said that would not solve the problem – the result would be the same government negotiating with Mr. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20.
""That is not enough,"" he said, in French.
Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne characterized what happened between Mr. Trudeau and Ms. Freeland as an internal party issue, and said the focus for the government must now pivot to getting ready for relations with the new U.S. president.
""What happens internally about how we organize ourselves, that's a discussion that happens in caucus,"" he said.
""But what I'm saying is that whilst there might be discussion we need to focus on really preparing.""
What is happening in Canadian politics, however, has caught Mr. Trump's eye. In a social media post late Monday night he referred to Ms. Freeland's behaviour as ""toxic"" and not conducive to making deals for Canada.
""She will not be missed!!!"" he wrote.
Liberal MP Yvan Baker – who is among the Liberals calling for Mr. Trudeau to resign – said in his view, Ms. Freeland will in fact be missed at the cabinet table.
""She brings a lot to the team, especially at a time like this,"" he said.
Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said what was on display in Ottawa Monday was a ""clown show,"" but no one should be laughing because it has consequences.
Mr. Trump is a deal-maker who will exploit any sign of weakness and that is what is on display, Mr. Poilievre told reporters in Mississaugua, Ont.
""Justin Trudeau's weakness is harming the reputation of all Canadians,"" he said. ""It's causing other world leaders to insult him, and indirectly, insult all Canadians.""",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Levitz, Stephanie; Fife, Robert; Walsh, Marieke",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 17, 2024",Prime ministers,
"Big bruising veteran brought back to Edmonton Oilers, with Bouchard 50/50 for Vegas game",2024,"This in from the Edmonton Oilers, news that they have recalled big bruising veteran d-man Josh Brown from the Bakersfield Condors.
This news comes as Edmonton has had a raft of d-man related news in the last two days, with Edmonton claiming right shot Alec Regula off waivers, Edmonton waiving journeyman d-man Travis Dermott, Evan Bouchard getting banged up by a sneaky hit in the Minnesota Wild game, Bouchard missing practice today, Dermott then getting claimed by the Wild on waivers, and Bouchard's injury being declared ""nothing major"" by Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch, adding that Bouchard is 50/50 for Saturday's afternoon game against Vegas.
My take
1. The main thing is that Bouchard's injury doesn't sound severe, which is exceedingly good news. Of course, Viktor Arvidsson's injury was supposed to have been resolved quickly and he's now been out for a month, so there's that. But I'll go with Bouchard being back in the line-up soon, and Josh Brown's recall being a cautionary move.
2. With Mattias Ekholm and Darnell Nurse playing some of the best hockey of their NHL careers, with Brett Kulak his steady self, and with both Ty Emberson and Troy Stecher both stepping up and playing smart, gritty, two-way hockey, the loss of Bouchard for a game or two or three would not spell disaster. This defensive group has is now playing as well as any group of d-men in the McDavid/Draisaitl Era.

McCURDY: The Wild grabs Oilers d-man

Edmonton Oilers' Bouchard 50-50 against Vegas following hellacious hit,2024,"Head, shoulders, knees and toes.
It's either the start of a famous nursery rhyme, or it's the list of any of the possible injuries suffered by Evan Bouchard's from a punishing hit late in Thursday's 7-1 win over the Minnesota Wild.
The Edmonton Oilers defenceman turned to retrieve a puck sent in behind his own net with 3:45 left in the game, when he was side-swiped by Wild forward Ryan Hartman, sending Bouchard headfirst into the net and goalie Calvin Pickard before hitting the end boards.
""Their player just hit Bouch into the net and, obviously, he falls in rather awkwardly,"" said Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch. ""It could have been really bad if Picks hadn't been there, it looks like he probably would have put his head off the post.
""But again, Picks made another big save, so he (Bouchard) just got banged up a little bit.""
Bouchard managed to pick himself up and gingerly made his way off the ice. He did not participate in Oilers practice Friday at the Downtown Community Arena and might miss Saturday's showdown against the Pacific Division-leading Vegas Golden Knights (2 p.m., Sportsnet).
""Obviously, he didn't skate today,"" Knoblauch said. ""He will get evaluated tomorrow and he will be a game-time decision.
""It's nothing major - we don't think it is. And tomorrow we'll find out. It's probably 50-50 (for Bouchard) to play tomorrow.""
If not, the Oilers will dress newly acquired waiver pickup Alec Regula, who was claimed from the Boston Bruins on Wednesday.
But the concern in the Oilers dressing room Friday revolved around the health of the team's top point-producing defenceman, as Bouchard has 22 points (six goals, 16 assists) in 29 games this season.
""He's kind of the unique defenceman we have on our back end,"" said his defensive partner, Mattias Ekholm. ""He's the offensive guy, he's the go-to guy when it comes to scoring goals and creating offence.
""If that's the case (and Bouchard sits out), I have no idea, but then obviously that would be a big loss. But we have a lot of pieces in here that if they're out they're big losses. We've had big guys out this year, too, and it's the next-man-up mentality.""
Not that a defenceman coming off an 82-point season (16 goals, 64 assists) is easily replaceable.
""It's tough. He's a little banged up, I think,"" said fellow Oilers blueliner Brett Kulak. ""We don't know really to what extent, but it's just a play. Hartman's obviously a physical player and just the way the game was going, I'm sure there's some frustration and they're looking to finish a few extra checks, and do whatever.
""Most of the time, you take a check and it's all good, but I don't know if he hit the post or what happened. I didn't get a chance to talk to him, but I hope he doesn't miss any time, or if he does have to it's not very much.""
Especially considering the way things have been going for the Oilers, who head into Saturday's tilt winners of seven of their past eight.
The wild thing is this run lines up perfectly with last year's eight-game win streak that began a turnaround that saw the slow-starting Oilers march all the way to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final.
This time around, the same stretch was interrupted by a 1-0 loss to the very same Golden Knights on Dec. 3.
The Knights come into this one winners of their last three, while the Oilers are on a season-high four-game win streak.
And they sure could use the services of Bouchard in Saturday's rematch.
""I think the game's over and it's out of reach at that point and you can kind of let the clock tick down,"" Kulak said of Hartman's extra effort. ""But players play with a lot of pride and they're competitive guys that get ready all day to prepare for the game.
""And you play to the final buzzer and you want to play hard. And if anything, you usually show them that you're ready for the next time you guys meet anyway.""
But that's a sentiment for another time. Right now, the focus is on keeping their streak going against the division leader, before turning around and taking on another division leader in the Florida Panthers on Monday.
Of course, the Oilers are riding high after dismantling a Wild team that wasn't just leading its division, but the entire league.
""They beat us twice this year, so obviously we would like to rectify that,"" Ekholm said of the Golden Knights. ""They're a great team, we know that they're usually at the top of the Pacific. We want to be at the top of the Pacific, so it's a big game.
""It's going to have a playoff-like feel to it, I'm sure.""

Regula reunited with former junior teammate bouchard; Oilers debut on hold while defenceman recovers from off-season knee surgery,2024,"It's like rolling up to a long line to pay for groceries just as the nearest teller opens up.
Or maybe more like a free fast pass at Disneyland.
Getting picked up by the Edmonton Oilers, with the early growing pains of the season pretty much behind them and their focus firmly placed on pushing toward and through the playoffs, is definitely the preferred method for any new recruit.
Alec Regula avoided the whole 0-3 gut punch the Oilers fell into the regular season with, and skipped right through the past couple months of toiling around the .500 mark as the Oilers looked anything but a team that was expected to crash into the season with a chip on its shoulder after losing Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final.
Instead, he got picked up off waivers by the Boston Bruins on Wednesday, just in time to catch the Oilers on a run that saw them win six of their previous seven, where their lone loss came 1-0 at the hands of the Pacific Division-leading Vegas Golden Knights.
The 24-year-old right-shot defenceman, who has yet to play an NHL game this season while recovering from knee surgery, caught up with his new team in Minnesota, where the Oilers were preparing to face the league-leading Wild on Thursday.
""I just had a few moments to talk to him,"" said Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch. ""The reports from our management on what type of player he is, his injury history and how he's progressed, and where he's going to be coming back.
""I also had to give Evan Bouchard a hard time because we've added another London Knight (of the Ontario Hockey League). But we're obviously very excited to have him as a part of our organization.""
Regula was not in the lineup for Thursday's game and no timeline has been given as to when he might make his Oilers debut.
""I think when we get home and practise in our building, and have a lot more time and not (be) on the run as much, you get to know that player a little bit more,"" Knoblauch said. ""Go over the systems and have those conversations.""
The 6-foot-4, 211-pound product of West Bloomfield, Mich., has one goal and 16 penalty minutes in 22 games since being drafted in the third round (57th overall) by the Detroit Red Wings in 2018.
He was acquired by then-Chicago Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman, now with the Oilers, in October 2019 before signing him for three years to a US$2.69-million entry-level contract.
Before the pros, Regula played junior with the Knights alongside Bouchard, and was named to the OHL first all-rookie team as the two played on the same defensive pairing.
""It's good to see him again,"" Bouchard said. ""Just to have a player like that in your organization is going to be very helpful.
""He's big, smart, sees the game really well. I think it's a good acquisition.""
And it certainly didn't hurt having such a familiar face in the dressing room as Regula made introductions.
""It's a lot of fun, it's been a while since I've seen him, but we had a lot of good times in London,"" Regula said. ""D partners there, and he's a great guy and just a really good guy to have on your side coming in. I think he's just someone I can lean on. Any questions and anything like that, he's really good with that kind of stuff.""
While the newcomer still has to acclimatize to his surroundings, there was no question about where he sees his new team heading.
""Just the guys they have in that room, you can tell right away the culture. They definitely have something special going on here,"" Regula said. ""It's very serious, you can tell right away they have one goal in mind and they're all kind of working together on that.
""It's definitely something special to be a part of.""
As for where he might fit in with it all, Regula will have to wait and see.
""It's a good question. I think finding my game first off would be great, and kind of getting my feet wet,"" he said. ""Definitely a little way to go there.
""I think I can help the team move the puck, get the puck into the hands of some of the special players they have there so they can make a lot of plays. And I think that's kind of the focus.""

"Cap-o-palooza! NHL insider predicts Edmonton Oilers will now have ""plenty of money"" to sign Connor McDavid and Evan Bouchard",2024,"Good news for the Edmonton Oilers by way of NHL insider Brian Lawton, news that the NHL salary cap is likely to go higher than the expected $92 million next year. This extra cap space will give owner Daryl Katz and his hockey bosses enough to secure top players Connor McDavid and Evan Bouchard and maybe others as well.
On Oilers Now, host Bob Stauffer asked Lawton what a cap of $94 or $95 million would mean to the Oilers.
It will help, Lawton said. ""This is part of the planning when you're managing a club. You have to make really tough calls on this. Generally, what had happened is a lot of people made the wrong calls in terms of where the cap was going, and they spent too quickly, and that lesson is still floating around out there. But now we're in an exact opposite situation....
""When you look at Edmonton, they're going to have plenty of money to sign the players they want to sign. I think they're going to be in a position to actually add (players) in the future, that the cap is going to get bumped up.""
Lawton continued: ""I see Edmonton having a lot more availability in the future.""
With added cap space, the Oilers should be scouring the league for the right player to bring in on defence, Lawton said. ""This is going to be the single biggest decision of the season... It's a massive decision. They need to find the right player, and a lot of analysis goes into that, and they need to make the right deal to bring that player home. Who it will be, nobody knows. There's a lot of other teams that are hunting for the same type of return. But this is a big decision for them, the hockey operations department.""
At NHL.com, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was quoted as saying the NHL salary cap is projected to be $92.4 million next season with the potential of it climbing slightly higher pending a possible negotiation between the League and NHL Players' Association. This season's salary cap is $88 million.
""The cap under the current guidelines in the Collective Bargaining Agreement would go up 5 percent. As we look at revenues, we're going to have discussions with the Players' Association about escrow levels and whether or not the cap can or should be tweaked a little more on an ongoing basis, but that's something that we have to really work out with the Players' Association and we're having those discussions.""
My take
1. I've been worried about the total amount paid to Edmonton's Top 4 players, given the history of NHL Cup winners in the Stanley Cup era. Only twice have teams paid more than 47 per cent of the total cap to their Top 4 players and gone on to win the Stanley Cup, and that happened in the early years of the Cap era, 2007 and 2008.
Recent Cup winners Colorado, Vegas and Florida paid 38.7, 41.5 and 44.3 per cent respectively of the cap on their Top 4 players.
2. In 2024, the Oilers paid their top four players 43.4 per cent of the cap. That will drop to 41.2 per cent of the cap this year, which should give the Oilers a good shot at the 2025 cup. But next year in the first year of the new Leon Draisaitl deal - even if the cap shoots up to $95 million - Edmonton will pay 48.2 per cent of the cap to its Top Four.
Obviously every extra million of cap space will be significant for the Oilers, and that issue will be even more acute if and when Bouchard and McDavid sign their new deals. Bouchard's next contract would also kick in next season, McDavid's new deal in 2006-07.

"McDavid only Oiler on Team Canada; Slow starts cost Hyman, Bouchard and Skinner their spots at 4 Nations",2024,"Connor McDavid making the Team Canada roster for the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament was never in question.
That the Edmonton Oilers captain was the sole representative of his team to make the squad shows how things have kind of been going for this group, fresh off an appearance in the Stanley Cup Final.
No Zach Hyman, no Evan Bouchard, no Stuart Skinner, each of whom helped make up the backbone of that near-miraculous run through the post-season.

Of course, that was then and this is now and their numbers have all taken a bit of a dive, especially Hyman, who went from scoring a career high 54 goals last year to being on pace for 10 this year.
""I think anyone who's on the cusp, or whatever the case may be, there is obviously disappointment,"" said Hyman, back in the Oilers lineup after missing five games with an undisclosed injury. ""At the same time, my focus has always been here with Edmonton, and controlling what I can control.""
At the time of the roster announcement, McDavid sat second in team scoring with 31 points (12 goals, 19 assists) in 22 games, one point behind Leon Draisaitl (17 goals, 15 assists), who will be watching the proceedings take place with no German representatives involved.
""It's an exciting group to be a part of,"" McDavid said. ""I'm extremely proud and honoured to be a part of that group and represent my country. That being said, no Zach, no Bouch, I think it speaks to the talent there is across the country in this game.
""It's a tough team to make and it speaks to some of the great players that are across Canada.""
The tournament could offer Canadian hockey fans a long-awaited look at two generational talents playing next to each other, should McDavid line up alongside Sidney Crosby.
""It would be special,"" said Mc-David, who previously pointed to Crosby as the one who should wear the captain's C.
""Lots has been made about this already, but it's going to be exciting to be on his team, maybe on his power play or on his line.
""But there are so many great players on that team, it's going to be great to be out there with anybody.""
But he's not the only one McDavid is looking forward to suiting up with at 4 Nations.
""I know Sam Bennett really well,"" McDavid said. ""He was my minor hockey linemate for eight years, so it'll be fun to be on his team.""
On the flip side, McDavid will open the tournament against a couple of Oilers teammates, as defenceman Mattias Ekholm and Viktor Arvidsson have been selected to the Swedish team.
""That will be fun. It's not very fun going up against Ek, or Arvie for that matter, but all three games, hopefully four, will be special,"" McDavid said.
""It's not a long tournament, it's a short one and you have to be ready to go right off the hop. Playing Ek and Arvie in the first game will be fun.""
""Obviously, it's a great recognition for those guys. Some of them aren't surprises,"" said Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch. ""I don't think there's any surprise McDavid was going to be on that team.
""But there's also some disappointed guys. I think I've talked to them more than the guys who made it. We feel there's a lot of guys that just missed out under circumstances. And a lot of them pointed out that next year's the big year. That's the one they want.""
Ekholm was also a shoo-in for tournament selection, having earned an astounding plus-minus rating of plus-76 to lead the league in his 125 games since joining the Oilers at the trade deadline in 2023.
""I'm just excited. It's an honour to play for your country, I haven't done so in a while, so I'm really looking forward to it,"" Ekholm said. ""It's going to be a tough task, we've got some good teams to play against.
""It's an exciting thing to be called for and if you look at that D-core, it's a hard one to crack. It's something I don't take lightly.""
Arvidsson got the nod despite earning just five points (two goals, three assists) in 16 games with the Oilers this season before being sidelined with a suspected lower body injury.
""I think he's earned it. He's a perfect player in a short tournament,"" Ekholm said.
""You can put him on the fourth line, you can put him on the second line, he's going to be effective wherever he is.
""He works hard and he makes it hard on the opposing team. I'm really happy for his sake and I think he's going to do great."" gmoddejonge@postmedia.com x.com/@GerryModdejonge","Edmonton Journal; Edmonton, Alta.","Edmonton, Alta.","Moddejonge, Gerry",Postmedia Network Inc.,"Dec 6, 2024",Tournaments & championships; Professional hockey,
"Ottawa faces calls to scrap rule allowing migrants crossing border covertly to claim asylum after two weeks:   Bloc Québécois MPs plan to challenge the government, citing a Canada Border Services Agency intelligence document obtained by The Globe and Mail that warned the immigration department last year of a big rise in clandestine crossings both north and south of the Canada-U.S. border",2024,"The federal government faced calls Friday to scrap a rule that allows migrants entering Canada clandestinely to claim asylum if they evade the authorities for two weeks, with opposition MPs saying asylum claims should be restricted to official ports of entry.
Bloc Québécois MPs plan to challenge the government in the House of Commons on Monday, citing a Canada Border Services Agency intelligence document obtained by The Globe and Mail that warned the immigration department last year of a big rise in clandestine crossings both north and south of the Canada-U.S. border.
The intelligence briefing says smugglers are charging up to $45,000 to sneak people across the border, including using routes into B.C. and Quebec, with thousands then making asylum claims.
People fleeing unsafe homelands are entitled to claim asylum in Canada, but under the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S., they are usually sent back to the U.S. at regular border crossings. Those who manage to cross clandestinely can claim asylum after 14 days in the country and have their cases heard.
Bloc immigration critic Alexis Brunelle-Duceppe and public safety critic Kristina Michaud issued a joint statement on Friday, calling on the government to act swiftly to end the 14-day rule. They cited the intelligence document that said ""clandestine entry into Canada has grown exponentially"" since the closing of the irregular Roxham Road border crossing in Quebec last year.
Mr. Brunelle-Duceppe said allowing people to claim asylum if they manage to hide from the authorities for two weeks ""makes a mockery of the aim to have a watertight and secure border.""
Ms. Michaud said the document showed that smugglers were profiting from the situation and vulnerable people were being exploited.
Opposition politicians and provincial premiers have raised fears about an influx of migrants to Canada from the U.S. after president-elect Donald Trump threatened to deport about 11 million people living there illegally.
""At a minimum, the 14-day rule should be suspended temporarily until we know what we are dealing with,"" said immigration lawyer Richard Kurland, who obtained the border agency's intelligence document through an access to information request.
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the U.S., asylum-seekers must make their claim in the first country in which they arrive. In March last year, the two countries restricted the agreement, ending the ability to claim asylum after crossing at Roxham Road.
Both Canada and the U.S. can terminate the agreement with six months' notice, and they can also negotiate changes. Immigration lawyer David Matas said ""the agreement could be extended by removing the possibility of staying in Canada if one enters Canada illegally and remains hidden for 14 days or more.
""That would be even more effective in discouraging traversal of the U.S. than the present form of the Agreement.""
Canada does not return people to the United States if they have been charged with an offence that could subject them to the death penalty.
Warda Shazadi Meighen, a lawyer at Landings LLP, said Canada would have the power to enact additional public-interest exemptions to help people facing persecution if they were returned to the United States.
""One can imagine a scenario where women fleeing gender-based violence, and individuals facing LGBTQ+ persecution, for example, would not get adequate protection under certain administrations in the United States,"" she said.",The Globe and Mail (Online); Toronto,Toronto,"Woolf, Marie",The Globe and Mail,"Dec 6, 2024",Agreements; Political asylum; Immigration,

8 Oilers Things: Can they handle Vegas? Bouchard for Team Canada? New guy problems,2024,"Things are starting to heat up.
The Edmonton Oilers are on a roll, the 4 Nations Face-Off rosters are about to be announced and the most revealing test of the season is up next on the schedule.
With the heart of the NHL season upon us, here are eight things to think about:
What happens in Vegas
Vegas is a first place team that's running hot, 6-3-1 in the last 10, and are viewing Tuesday's game the same way the Oilers are - a measuring stick between a pair of heavyweight contenders who plan on emerging from the Pacific Division playoffs. Edmonton is the second hottest team in the NHL right now behind 8-2-0 Toronto but their record against winning teams hasn't been great. If you're wondering where the Oilers really stand 25 games into the season, Tuesday evening will provide all the clarity you need.
The start of something?
Two goals in the last two games, even if one of them was an empty-netter, are a welcome sight for Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. The veteran forward is off to a horrible start offensively with just four goals and 12 points in 24 games despite first line ice time and a steady spot on the power play. He's a loyal soldier who is beloved in Edmonton, but the production numbers are in a black hole, especially with the power play running at just 17 per cent. Maybe the two-game scoring streak is the start of something. Oilers fans are hoping so with the Stanley Cup window open and four and a half years left on his contract.
Unsung hero
You gotta love Mattias Janmark. He does everything right, plays hard minutes, works the penalty kill and still finds time to help generate offence from his third-line spot. He's second in scoring among Oilers forwards after Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl with 10 points in 24 games. That's just two points off his total for all of last season and well ahead of a pace to break his career high of 34 points set seven years ago in Dallas. This isn't coming out of nowhere, either. It's a continuation of last year's playoff run when he was sixth in scoring among Oilers forwards with eight points in 25 games.
Down again
The concern when the Oilers acquired Viktor Arvidsson is that he has a hard time staying healthy. He played just 18 games last season after back surgery and was held to 58 or fewer in four of the last six years. And now, after five points in his first 16 games as an Oiler he is back on the shelf, having missed eight games and counting with an undisclosed injury. It's a risk Oilers management accepted when they signed him to a two-year deal at $4 million a year. They're hoping it pays off down the road but right now it's not helping a bit.
Winning on the dot
Don't look now but the Oilers are third in the NHL in face-off winning percentage (53.9 per cent). Leon Draisaitl is the workhorse on this front, taking 435 of Edmonton's 1,324 draws this season and winning 56.8 per cent of them. In 159 trips to the dot, Derek Ryan is an outstanding 61.6 per cent while Adam Henrique is 51.6 on 256 faceoffs. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins is 55.7 on 140 draws. The only player among their top five face-off guys below 50 per cent is Connor McDavid (47.5 on 219 draws).
4 Nations stock
Edmonton's slow start is probably going to keep a couple of Oilers off the 4 Nations Face-Off roster, which was finalized Sunday and will be released on Wednesday. Zach Hyman looked like a lock to be on a line with Connor McDavid, but going from 54 goals last season to three in the first 20 games of this year, and then getting injured right as the roster is being selected, cost him a spot. And goaltender Stuart Skinner was also on the radar after taking Edmonton to the Cup final last year. He's been much better in recent games but he might have run himself out of time.
What about Bouchard?
Evan Bouchard was another lock after a career year last season, but a slow start to the season put him on the bubble. His best work comes on the power play, but Edmonton is just 17.7 per cent on the man advantage this year and his own totals are suffering for it. He's making a late charge, 11 points in the last nine games (after seven in the first 15). He is also prone to the big mistake, which can be very costly in a short tournament, but he is state of the art offensively and if used in situations that play to his strengths he would be a valuable weapon.
Come back Zach
Team Canada aside, Hyman, like Nugent-Hopkins, is another player who needs to find his groove if the Oilers are going to pull off another deep playoff run. His shooting percentage fell from 18.6 last year to 5.9 this year, leaving him on pace for 12 goals. If that doesn't change (he's a career 13.4 per cent shooter) it's going to be a long season for him and a short one for the Oilers. He's too important to fall off the edge of the world offensively.
